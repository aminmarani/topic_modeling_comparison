Doc ID: 3290, distribution: 0.9954142461479644 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 4335, distribution: 0.9938710689861813 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 4125, distribution: 0.9906850603597617 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

Doc ID: 3410, distribution: 0.9890293903039926 ; Therapy .. // rupture time again  My therapist and I had a bit of a rupture last session. We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow.

Doc ID: 2365, distribution: 0.9890293903039926 ; Therapy .. // I still hate starting  I think I could be in therapy for  years and still not be good at starting a session. This session I looked around the room blankly and eventually pulled a helpless face at T, and she just raised her eyebrows back at me and smiled in a kind of carefully equally-helpless “yes, this is a dilemma isn't it?” I sighed and looked at my short page of notes and said “I'm trying to decide what order to say things in”. This is just a variation on things I say to try and get started. “Hmm ok. Well, you could start with the most difficult to get it out of the way, or you could build up to it and do it last but we might run out of time…” This is also just a variation on things T says in response to me trying to get started. I wish I could be someone who just sits down and start splurging their innermost thoughts. I seem to need  or  minutes for the emotional pressure to build up enough to get me speaking. I don't know whether there's any way to bypass this. I might bring it up next session. If nothing else, it will be a different way to start 🤷‍♀️ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3805, distribution: 0.9875546728994461 ; Therapy .. // a snippet  We were towards the end of therapy today and T was on a roll, talking talking talking about anger. Sometimes she gets like this, she says lots of really good and potentially helpful stuff but sometimes she gets carried away and misses the fact that I'm not quite with her. I was still processing something she'd said just previously which I was quite impacted by, and there she was going on and on about something that felt quite irrelevant. Eventually I burst out in frustration “Can you stop talking for a minute!” T stopped talking immediately and said “mm of course”. Then she said “Well done for telling me to stop…. I'm glad you could say that to me…..” (Sorry T sorry that was rude, thankyou for taking it so well) I was so shocked that I'd just cut her off like that. T probably thinks of it as progress. I sat in stunned silence for some minutes after, trying to get control of myself and cope with what I'd just said and also think about she'd said immediately before all of that, that had rather knocked my feet from under me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3120, distribution: 0.9872694570083931 ; I haven't had time to stop and process (journal) Tuesday's therapy session yet. All that keeps going round in my head is the end of the session, when I shut down and T asked “Are you angry with me?” and I told her I was. Then she said that we were right at the end of the session, and did I want to wind down for five minutes or just leave it there? I was feeling so mad and I didn't want to engage any more, but I knew if I left the session in this state I would probably feel worse over this coming week than if we at least did a bit of grounding now, so I reluctantly agreed to keep going. There was a lot of internal resistance and I really didn't want to talk to T about the surface-level things she started trying to make conversation with me over. For the last few minutes, I let her do most of the talking till time was up. She tried to get in some supportive stuff and building up “I'm on your side” kind of things. Then we said goodbye. I was still mad but at least we had a bit of wrapping-up to contain the mad until next session.

Doc ID: 2425, distribution: 0.986329581185506 ; Question: I feel like it would be helpful to write a 'fictional' story about surviving being abused when I was a lot younger to process a lot that happened while maybe being able to disconnect myself from it. I don't want it to become a thing that makes me spiral as it's all dragged up again and my therapist isn't sure that it's a good idea right now but I think it's helpful? Do you think it's a good idea? Have you found writing things down helpful ever? Your blog helps me a lot, Faith so thank you! X  Answer: Hmm I don't know. I feel like I'm not really well-placed to advise you on this anon, since you and your therapist both know yourself much better than I do. If you do decide to write it, I'd take it steady and monitor your feelings, and if it starts to stir up a lot of feelings then take a break or pause. I usually do find writing things down helpful but that's just me. Thanks for your message 😊 xx

Doc ID: 4845, distribution: 0.9856219066130208 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3312, distribution: 0.9852747884589738 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

⁣
" things I learned in :⁣
. talk about your feelings, no matter how hard they may be. you're not crazy & you're not alone.⁣
. you deserve more than being thrown around like a toy. stand up for yourself.⁣
. use your voice. don't let anyone silence it.⁣
. trust the process. things will work out, even when it seems like it is the end.⁣
. love yourself & believe in yourself first.⁣
. you are loved and cared for. you do matter, even when you feel like you don't.⁣
. you have the choice to make a change in your life. don't be afraid.⁣
. allow yourself to take a break.⁣
. this is your story. you know yourself. you know the truth.⁣
. tell your loved ones how much you love and appreciate them while you have the chance.⁣
. you're not the problem. you deserve better than someone who can't understand you and strings you along.⁣
. as hard as it is to let people go, you have to do it. you have to accept that people aren't who they painted themselves out to be.⁣
. let yourself be happy and don't let anyone take that away from you.⁣
. you are so brave for taking the hardest step and reaching out for help.⁣
. feel what you feel. it's okay to be sad. it's okay to be anxious. it's okay to not be okay.⁣
. give yourself more credit for all that you've accomplished.⁣
. stop worrying so much about the future. focus on the present. focus on yourself.⁣
. hold onto hope. you are resilient. keep on fighting.⁣
. it's okay if the only thing you did this year was survive. please choose to stay." - @ashlekhram

“I'm so lost I don't know my next steps are😩”

“I know something needs to change but I don't know what!!” 

“I'm so unhappy with where I am 😭”

Wellll👀

Instead of looking for the next best thing or a solution to all of your problems, maybe what you need right now is just to 

s l o w 
d o w n 

& see where you could be giving yourself some more time, energy, and attention🦋

DISCLAIMER: this can be really hard for people who spend a large portion of their life taking care of other people.. and maybe that is you right now!

I want to remind you taking care of yourself & making sure you have adequate time to feel like you can 🦋breathe🦋 improves the quality of the way you can take care of and show up for other people!

If you do feel like you've: 

✅gotten enough rest 
✅ createdenough space to breath
❌but you still don't know which direction to take…

that's exactly what I do in my coaching program *cue music* 💃

I help multi-talented, multi-passionate career women:

✨drop limiting beliefs 
✨begin to write their own story 
✨live a life on their own terms 

If that's you, check out the  link my bio: @amandavsevilla, send me a DM, let's get chatting!!

If you made it this far, what has been your favorite form of ✨self care✨ that brings you back to YOU? Drop yours in the comments⬇️

Doc ID: 9567, distribution: 0.9907307744815944 ; every relationship is different, but one thing i've come to learn is that no one can be everything to you.

expecting otherwise is a quick path to resentment.

i used to expect boyfriends in the past to make me feel happy, to make feel worthy, and to make me feel good about myself and my life, and when they couldn't, i'd put the blame on them. it wasn't until i took responsibility for my own life and happiness that things began to change.

as  is coming to an end, and people are looking forward to  being their “best year”, i hope you recognize that nothing will change if nothing changes. you won't magically start thriving even with the love and support of someone else unless you prioritize taking ownership for your actions, cultivating self-love, creating new habits that support your growth, facing your inner challenges and discomfort, learning to trust and surrender, and feeding your dreams.

strong healthy relationships can make the biggest difference, but the best thing a friend, partner, or family member can do isn't be our number one fan, but help support and encourage us to become our own number one fan.

takeaway: that person you keep searching for to make you happy? it's you. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8712, distribution: 0.9905595494603586 ; hint: you don't actually need to HAVE all the things or truly be confident and clear on your forward motion for this to work!

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

——
STOP shrinking yourself into some arbitrary box when you are meant to be so much more 📦
STOP caring so much about what other people think because you're never going to be everybody's cup of tea 🍵
STOP living a life that is small when you could be living a life that is big and vibrant 🌈
STOP comparing yourself to others and past versions of you 🙅🏻‍♀️
STOP worrying about the future when right now are the good old days 💭
STOP getting in your own way because life is short and precious, and you deserve to be living your life to its fullest🌟

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

maybe you've struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here's what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don't have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don't show up % for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can't do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else's emotions (whew! that's a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

my inner critic voice is loud today, but rather than letting it dictate my life and influence my actions, i'm choosing a new narrative to tell myself instead. gentle reminder that we are our biggest influence, and the way we speak to ourselves matters!

here are some affirmations that are working for me today and may be resonating with you too:

i am greater than the narrative my anxiety is creating in my head.

i matter, and i deserve to live a life of peace, joy, fulfillment, and love. i will let go of and separate myself from the things getting in the way of the life i deserve.

i am in control of how i show up, what i focus on, and how i respond.

i am enough. who i am is enough. what i do is enough. working on accepting and loving myself fully and unconditionally is how i take my power back.

the past  months have been some of the hardest yet also happiest months of my life. i've experienced a lot of change, fear, resistance, and self-doubt, but with those, i can look back and see that i've also grown tremendously.  i've practiced courage and now know my strength,  learned more about what my own needs are and set boundaries accordingly, developed appreciation for the journey, chosen to love myself more than ever despite *noise* telling me i'm not worthy enough, and created a sense of peace within me that i've never had before because i trust that even in the waiting, the not knowing, and the crazy that everything will be okay

i loveeeeee cooking dinner with you guys 🥹 here's some inspo for this week! save this just for the super easy high protein dressing alone— so so versatile! 

loaded veggie & feta green goddess quinoa bowls

details:

- some of the veggies here are roasted and some are steamed (just based my preference for each one). i start with the roasted veggies since these take the most time (zucchini tossed in olive oil and spices, roasted for - min at F. there's also a green veggie burger on this same sheet baked the same way!)
- onto the steamed veggies— i love cauliflower and broccoli steamed more than i do roasted. i steam each one in the microwave with some spices. i do  min and  seconds for the broccoli and  minutes for the cauliflower. i use the green goddess seasoning form trader joe's on these veggies
- while those are roasting, i toss canned artichoke hearts with green goddess seasoning— no need to prep these beyond that!
- next i make my classic hummus dressing with a green goddess twist. i steamed  cup of peas in the microwave for one minute before adding to the blender with a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!
- once the roasted veggies are done assemble your bowl with a greens base of choice, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, artichokes, green goddess dressing, quinoa, and feta of course
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

fall harvest kale salad

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
-  apples of choice, diced (i used envy apples)
-  can of chickpeas (oz), rinsed and drained
- / cup vegan feta cheese

maple djion vinaigrette:

-  tbsp dijon mustard
- - tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup      
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the vinaigrette over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

let's just say i'm a HUGE fan now 🤪

this lemon pesto pasta salad is SUCH an easy and nourishing meal that's super meal prep friendly. i make a big batch for quick meals throughout the week. details below!

vegan lemon pesto pasta salad

start by cooking your pasta according to the package. the one i used said to boil for  minutes, but i found  minutes to be perfect. this is a chickpea pasta by the way, which makes this dish high protein! once the noddles are done cooking, drain and rinse with cold water. add to a bowl and add the following:

- diced red onion
- diced green onion
- cucumber slices
- avocado chunks
- chopped parsley

toss everything together and then add in the vegan lemon pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human — there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.
