Doc ID: 11094, distribution: 0.4017750322818756 ; Well hi hello from a snowy UK, because yes, shock horror it apparently got cold enough to snow AND decided to settle with us for a few days woooooweeeee 😱❄️✨⛄️
-
Now first of all, I haven't seen snow this thick in a loooooooong long time. So I'm like where did all this white stuff come from!? 😂 And secondly, I find it so funny how snow days as a child meant sledging in the fields for hourssssss, literally hours, whilst now it simply means staying inside all day and only facing the snow for a quick photoshoot 😏
-
I mean, you've got to take advantage of these special moments my friends. Snow in the south of the UK is pretty rare! But sadly, I look like Rudolph after  minutes of being outside with a bright red nose . . . sorry I'm late ? 😅
-
On the topic of snow memories, one of my favourites was probably from over ten years ago now, but we essentially got realllllllly thick snow one year. The thickest I've probably ever seen. As we couldn't drive, the five of us at home all had to treck to the shops and pull food back on a sledge, which I thought was epic at the time 😉 And that same year when Dad was sent out to get food alone one day, he literally bought home nothing on Mum's list except cookies. Bags and bags of chocolate chips cookies!!!! I mean, Mum went crazy, but Em, Matthew and I didn't complain at. all. 🙌🏻🍪
-
Anyway, I love you snow and you're definitely a preeeeetty sight, but you are far too cold for me if I'm totally honest!!! Let me know if you have snow where you are right now, wherever you are in the world, and I hope you're all safe, smiling and drinking hot choc watching Netflix right now because it's. a. vibeeeee✌🏻

Doc ID: 11182, distribution: 0.386372447013855 ; So this is just a little appreciation post for how much my confidence on boats has grown since travelling in Australia 😱🙌🏻
-
I wish I could show you a video from agessssss and ages ago when I was a lot younger, because I think that's where my phobia for boats and the sea originated. I remember it all too well: screaming and crying my eyes out on this small, rocking boat whilst @lemonem_ily and @veganmutti were paragliding or something like that. It was a pretty awful experience, and of course for everyone else who had to endure that boat ride listening to me (oops 😂), but ever since, the thought of going on a boat has given me so much anxiety. And on top of that, whenever I've had to go on a boat (because there is literally no other alternative), I've never felt relaxed at all. They used to freak me out, big time.
-
However. Wow this is crazy to say, but with the amount of boat rides I've done in the past  months (including living on a boat), I genuinely think I've conquered my fear! And I am so proud of myself ngl ☺️
-
As I've said before in videos, the phobia has always been psychological and I've simply had to face the fear on my own, trying to fight the thoughts in my head. I told myself that the boat was hardly very dissimilar to a plane or a car, and I fixated my attention, not on the fact that we were rocking and bobbing up and down, but on something completely different. Whether that be through talking to someone else on the boat, listening to something on my phone, setting up my dive gear or eating. You know, I really think that if you have a fear and you want to get rid of it, all you have to do is face it. Yep, it's a lot easier said than done, but it's just a mind game a lot of the time 🤔
-
Trust me, if you can beat a fear in , I cannot describe to you how good you'll feel. Snakes? Spiders? Boats? Heights? Whatever it may be, try and overcome it this year ✌🏻

Doc ID: 10833, distribution: 0.2975822687149048 ; Let's talk MONEY FREEDOM vs. FRUGALITY #freedomfriday 🧐🌽💰 and please comment down below if you can resonate with any of this as I'd love to hear your thoughts👇🏻
-
I've mentioned in a few of my YouTube videos that I grew up being very, *very* scared of spending any money. And then when I did make a purchase it would honestly cripple me 😣
-
I'd overthink the amount I'd spent, what I'd bought and I'd be left with this huge feeling of guilt, regret and shame.
-
Now I did start earning my own money at quite a young age when I danced in Billy Elliot the Musical for a year, and then I've learned to take more control of my finances ever since I started YouTube and creating content online 🎥🍉
-
However, all throughout university I was still incredibly frugal. All I did was save, save, save, and I could never properly convince myself that putting money towards the things I enjoyed would enhance my life 🤷🏻‍♀️
-
Now don't get me wrong, you need to be sensible with your money. I know where my income comes from, I manage my money well and saving IS a great thing, even for future Holly. But everything started to shift for me, and I became less obsessed with a life of frugality, when I started travelling 🌏🏄🏻‍♀️
-
I realised that I could invest my money into insane experiences that would change my life, pay a bit more for food out to try something new, or just buy a ticket to have the best time out with my family / friends!! Honestly, it's only added more smiles, laughter and happiness to my life 💫
-
Of course, I pay for my essentials. I pay for my needs. But I can now freely choose to put my money towards the things I want, which for me, is mostly incredible food, travel and adventures!! It's rarely materialistic things, but we're all very different so you do you 🌼🫶🏻
-
So. In summary of Holly's end of the week essay: please please pleaseeee don't live your life afraid to spend anything, because at the end of the day money isn't going to do you any good just sitting there in a savings account 🤔✨

#freedomfriday ep.  from Holly 💚

Doc ID: 11173, distribution: 0.25540441274642944 ; So we've been opening up A LOT recently on the Tube now haven't we!? You've heard me talk about relationship-sy things (and this shook me the most ngl 😳), my weight, body image, feeling confined at home, loneliness etc etc etc... and for me personally, no matter what the topic, I just think it's honestly crazy how much solo travelling has made me realise and come to terms with.
-
On top of that, I've kind of found myself going solo here in Australia by accident. I grew up with homesickness and always wanted to live my life in the UK. I could 'experience' the world through pictures or videos online, which I was perfectly happy with 🤷🏻‍♀️ And even when I found the slightest ounce of motivation to actually go and see some incredible places by myself, I always planned to do it with my dude, @lemonem_ily. We would travel as a duo and Australia had always been top of our list (for a reason I don't even know myself ... Australia just seemed cool 😂).
-
Ok so fast forward  years of studying at uni: I graduated last year, was lucky enough to go to New York post exams, surf and do yoga for  days in France and complete my first intro dive in Greece on a family holiday. Exploring new places seemed pretty fun, you know. But here's the thing. Em has a full-time job that I know she loves. She's the best person for the role, I think anyway (🙃), and I couldn't be happier for her. I'd never want to see her leave just for me, and so that's when I was like, you know what, yo-freaking-lo ... let's commence #hollygoessolo 😅 (in all honesty, I named the series after the first episode. It definitely wasn't planned in advance lol).
-
So yes, that's the story behind why I'm here travelling alone. But I seriously wouldn't change anything, and cannot wait to continue my little explorations with my ...  backpacks, bumbag, Aldi bag and one extra for food 🤦🏻‍♀️🌏 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 10828, distribution: 0.21680061519145966 ; Are you happier when it's sunny? Because I'll definitely be one to put my hand up here 🙈🙋🏻‍♀️⛅️
-
Ok yes, these photos are a throwback to Los Angeles 😅🙈 Butttttt you guys, the UK is finally starting to brighten up, and with that I have definitely noticed that I am feeling a lot more optimistic 🤷🏻‍♀️
-
Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I have SAD, seasonal affective disorder, which is defined as depressive episodes that follow a seasonal pattern. But the weather does alter my mood for sure 🧬
-
SAD itself is thought to occur in roughly  million people in the UK alone, and those with this disorder typically show signs of low mood and reduced energy levels throughout the winter months.
-
Whilst research still needs to be done, seasonal mood fluctuations may be linked to the biology of serotonin: a neurotransmitter responsible for promoting happiness, pleasure and satisfaction 😊 Sunlight may, for example, regulate serotonin uptake into neurons (nerve cells) resulting in an increase in its activity in summer and a corresponding decrease in winter. Pretty cool, right 🤓
-
Research also points to the hormone melatonin, as well as vitamin D, but my advice regardless of the nitty gritty details is to get yourself outdoors!! If you're in UK right now, or you live somewhere and it's getting warmer, please please please take advantage of the sunshine 🌞👌🏻 Go outside, go and watch the sunset, or eat your breakfast under the sunshine one morning, because trust me, you'll feel a whole lot better for doing so 👏🏻
-
If you're also looking for the perfect hoodie for spring and summer then remember to check out the new @narnastore hoodies, and our bumbags are also perfect for this time of year too (ps: the code NARNA will get you % off your order) 🍌✌🏻
-
So I am thanking the weather this week and over the bank holiday weekend for inspiring this  #freedomfriday post ✨ Even though there are sometimes things you cannot do to easily change your mood, the spring feels definitely reminded me that I am always free to lift it slightly within a bit of sunshine, vitamin D and by getting outdoors 🦋

Anyway, as promised, I wanted to share on here some of my top P O D C A S T recommendations! Over the past few months I learnt so much just by regularly tuning in to a podcast, everything from feminism to the benefits of eating garlic. I'll listen whilst waking, running or even when I'm spinning on my bike, and it's really taught me to learn and absorb information just by simply listening.
-
These are in no particular order, but here are the five that I listen to most often:
-
 // @adultingpod by @oenone which I mention all the time . . . but it is probably my favourite. I'd never learned a lot about feminism before, and Oenone has taught me so 👏🏻 much 👏🏻
-
 // The @deliciouslyella podcast was a recent discovery but I could listen to Ella on repeat over and over again. One of my favourite episodes was their one with Joseph Poore about veganism and climate change.
-
 // @howtofailpod by @elizabday I looooooove. The last one I listened to was with Tara Westover because I was so inspired by her memoir “Educated”.
-
 // No Such Thing as a Fish. I don't know what to say about this one other than the fact that it's hilarious. I never seem to remember any of the crazy facts they come up with, but the concept of the podcast is so unique.
-
 // And finally Give Me Strength by @aliceliveing 💪🏻
-
I've listened to a few episodes of @thegirlsbathroom and Today in Focus by the @guardian. I can also recommend About Race by @renieddolodge, Go With The Fall (by Flo herself who reached out to me), Ankita's podcast in Oz @universitypodcast (I was in a couple of episodes 😉), @nutrition_facts_org and @coffeebreakgerman 🇩🇪
-
Let me know if you guys have any suggestions as I am always looking for more to tap into. Oh and I do use the app called 'Overcast' but I'm considering switching to Apple Podcasts 🤔
-
Anyway, those are just a handful if you're interested in listening to any podcasts. I cannot wait to finish editing the video I filmed today but as always, I'll let you know when it's live 😏

-
I've only recently, over the past two years or so, found the confidence to spend time alone in a cafe or restaurant out in public . . . and yes, who remembers me doing this earlier in  on Valentine's Day itself 🙈😅 I mean, that was definitely a classic Holly thing to do though lol 😉
-
But in all seriousness, one of my favourite ways to enjoy spending time alone is by taking myself out to try new food, especially on my travels 🌎 This mini-solo date was filmed in Switzerland, and the biggest shoutout to @mairuebe_luzern for having me 🥰🤌🏻 It's a fully vegan, family run business in Lucerne (or Luzern) and I'd highly recommend visiting if you're nearby!! #gifted 
-
There is something so special about enjoying your own company, and it can simply be through just reading in a park, going on a long walk and listening to a podcast or working in a new cafe . . . there are literally so so many things you can do! And what's best is that you're the only one who needs pleasing 😏
-
So if you're currently scared of doing something like this, or find it difficult to be alone with just yourself, then please please please make it one of your goals for , and trusttttt me, you're going to love it 🤩💚

-
I've already been able to resonate with it in so many ways, and I thought I'd start sharing with you guys how I've truly embraced freedom in my life each week 👏🏻
-
Most recently, and in contrast to Holly a few years ago, I've been able to find comfort in giving myself the space to be flexible and not worry so much about sticking to 'plan A' 🤨🧐 In short, I was supposed to be in Asia right now 😅🌏
-
At the end of  I had planned to be solo travelling, slowly, around South East Asia, for goodness knows how long, and truly living my best life as a digital nomad!! I'd booked flights, had my vaccinations, booked accommodation . . . the full thing 🙈
-
Buttttttt. As we all know, a lot has changed in my life (in the best way possible) and I'm clearly not in Asia right now 😂 Apparently I ended up in Ikea the other weekend instead, but I'll see you all from the other side of the globe very soon . . . #hollygoesduo is pending 😏
-
Best of all: I haven't stressed myself out at all about this new plan, or change of plan, and if anything, I'm even more excited about this new adventure 🤩

-
It always feels special going back to this place. This is ultimate cheese, but I'll forever be grateful for everything Cambridge taught me. The highs, the lows. The stressful, go-go-go terms and the rare nights out clubbing (which were. a. vibe. let me tell you 😏). It's also, and of course, where Holly Gabrielle all started. I truly wouldn't be here without my time at Cambridge and I'll never forget my  years (or  seconds as it felt like, one big blur basically 😅).
-
I also truly believe that everything happens for a reason. My rejection. My gap year. My master's. It's all helped me reach where I am today. And that's simply happy. The happiest I've ever been in fact.
-
My talk yesterday was all about 'life outside the bubble'. Cambridge was my bubble, and I'm now pushing beyond my little Holly bubble to find my own feet. Carve my own mould and fill my own shoes. I'm not % certain about the future, but I'm certainly not certain AND miserable (thank you @steven for this nugget of pure wisdom 👌🏻)!!!

I'll share some of the talk with you guys in the vlog coming out later this week, and as always, here's to whatever happens in the future 🥂 (ps: *I'm not pregnant *see last photo* 🤰🏻😂)

-
So I've been out of running for about  weeks now, and I'm only just starting to get back into it slowly. Don't get me wrong, it sucks not being able to do the things you love, buttttt. In the past I used to get so frustrated with an injury just because I feel the *need* to exercise.
-
I used to do literally anything and everything to keep moving: push through pain, delay the healing by just continuing to run, orrrr cycle a tonne for example, even though I'm not the biggest fan of just staring at a blank wall whilst spinning my legs 😅
-
For context, I basically came off with an injury after my k run in December last year. And tendonitis is definitely not something that heals overnight annoyingly. But this has been the first time (in my life!!) when I've truly surrendered and just given my body the time it needs to rest. And most importantly, I haven't felt at all bad about it at 👏🏻 all 👏🏻
-
Ok I may have lost a bit of fitness and running progress, but at the end of the day, everything is only ever temporary and your health and your body has to be your main priority 🤌🏻
-
So please please please look after yourself and remember that rest is essential! If you also find yourself in an unhealthy relationship with food, your body and exercise, then I definitely encourage you to reach out and get help, because you really don't want to live the rest of your life trapped in that bubble! Trust me, I've been there but I'm never going back 💚

Doc ID: 9551, distribution: 0.20262791216373444 ; anyone else get the sunday scaries like i do?

i often feel like i don't get enough rest on the weekends, and while it's easy to blame the weekends for being too short, i know that my struggle to recharge every weekend is also due to me spending sundays letting my anxiety about everything i need to do take over.

something i'm still working on, but have gotten a lot better with, is learning to take control over my sundays again. here are some tips to help deal with the sunday scaries:

. PACE YOURSELF THROUGH THE WEEK: i've been studying outside of work for a big exam i'm taking in a few weeks, and even though it can be hard to get the motivation to study after my work days, dedicating - hours to it every day instead of putting it off until the weekend has made a big difference. whether it's chores, errands, or studying, pacing yourself, gives you more time to do things for you on sunday.
. DO SOMETHING: sometimes when i have a lot of anxious thoughts swirling around in my head, doing something (literally anything) helps allow my thoughts to settle.
. GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK: on the contrary to my last point, if planning a sunday of commitments before a week of commitments stresses you out, don't plan anything and let yourself wake up and see how you feel before deciding how you want to spend your day.
. LOG OFF IF YOU CAN: some ways to do that include staying off social media (or setting more boundaries with it), ignoring non-urgent work-related emails, or even having a phone free day.
. PLAN FUN OR RELAXING ACTIVITIES FOR YOURSELF: whether it's calling a friend, reading a book, going out for ice cream, or having a more glorified netflix evening with your favorite snacks and wine, i find scheduling enjoyable activities both on the weekends AND during the week makes the difference between them less extreme and life more enjoyable.
. REWRITE THE MENTAL SCRIPT: anticipation is usually worse than reality. even though work can sometimes feel stressful, getting something done is never as big and time-consuming as it is in my head, and even though i have less free time on weekdays, there's still joy, peace, and rest to be experienced during the week too.

had a really incredible dinner at @vedgephiladelphia last night, and i couldn't have asked for a better meal to celebrate my birthday with. even though neither blake nor i are vegan, every dish we had was *chef's kiss*

this birthday was definitely different than others - i cried twice even though nothing “happened”, i felt a lot of the heaviness of the world, the only person who i got to hug was blake, and i felt a lot more disconnected to the people i love in my life - but, none of that was “bad”, and the day was so special in its own ways.

this year has taught me a lot about accepting life's circumstances, change, the unknown, my feelings, and myself, and i wouldn't haven't wished yesterday to have been any different because there's soooo much i feel grateful for (including all of you!), and i trust in the universe that all of this is leading to something more.

i know i'm not the only one feeling the weight of the world, so here's a 🌹 for anyone who needs it. CHEERS to making it to friday!!

p.s. as much as i want to normalize struggling especially in the world's current circumstances, i don't want to normalize not reaching out for help if you need it. it's okay to feel pain, but you deserve to feel joy too.

they say you need to love yourself first before anyone else can love you, and i don't think that's true because without the love of people like blake, i wouldn't have gotten the push and support that really helped me keep fighting for LIFE.  since day , blake has encouraged me to put myself first, and while he was able to love me before i loved myself, it was only until after i started loving myself that i was able to accept the love from him that i  now know i deserve.

today, i am feeling extra grateful for moments like these with my guy.

no more tears and bouts of anger after eating our bodyweight in pizza and ice cream.

no more spending our dinner conversations talking about the nutritional information in what we're eating.

no more body checking and asking blake every  minutes if i still look okay after eating.

no more letting my own guilt and shame around food interfere with our relationship.

life is uncertain, full of change, and really freaking hard at times, but in this moment, life is good.

today is a new day though, and i am feeling so grateful for the simple things and everyday joys of life. it's easy to be happy when you're on vacation, get paid, are celebrating something, have a night out, etc., but if you can't feel good showing up to work on a monday or running errands in middle of a random wednesday, are you really living a life that you love? freedom is an inner job, and life becomes pretty extraordinary when you find the grace, joy, and “enoughness” in the everyday moments

 i try to stay rational and tell myself not to fall into delusions of grandeur or whatever but the voices i hear and the presences i feel are really trying to convince me otherwise and while its comforting to feel connected to passed on loved ones and other assorted benevolent beings its very crisis-inducing and emotionally draining because in THIS society ur fucking crazy if u believe / actually experience “that shit” 
 i wanted to film my ask response vid today (i think  questions per vid is plenty) but now im kinda frantic to start/finish a scientic article essay that i been putting off bc of all this corona panic. i dont know what to focus on rn. its absolutely madness being expected to keep up on conventional life niceties when i'm in crisis mode bc everyone around me is in crisis mode and idk what information is true or valid or what to think rn i just know something sinister is going on WHATEVER is is whether its the media's overt display of mind control or an actual bioweapon issue or impending population control/martial law/quarantine or whether its just flat out governmental negligence IDK whatever it is its fucking wack and i can feel the tension and the urgency that the world is feeling right in my gut. i couldnt even shit for like  days i was so stressed out. YAL KNOW ME YAL KNOW MY REGULR BM's are like the most important thing to me KEK. like i need to find my seeds and start cleaning my yard so i can raise a bed for a veg garden once the earth thaws but i have fucking HOMEWORK due in two days ha HA like what even should be priorities at this point. am i a doomsday farmer or am i a fucking student like i really need to know at this point bc ive had this impending sense of doom for years now and NOW all my fears / suspicions are just coming to life and i rly am trying to make the most logical decisions with my time but IDK HOW TO SPEND MY TIME when idk whats even actually going on rn 
 up all night fucking trimming plants and cleaning my garden since i have to START THE FUCK OVER now bc my dad left the bitch in such a state that when i took over i was doomed either way.  my primary source of income bout to take a hit for the next few months. and was still up all night bc i had to shower after bc plant matter and sweat makes u gross and itchy and then luna was havin a hypoglycemic attack as soon as i fall asleep at am so then im tending to her THEN i gotta wake up to sell a bag at am like AGHHHHH i just wanna sleep. i always thought i'd be GOOD under apocolyptic pressure but im realizing im nowhere near prepared or rested enough to ever be able to function good idek man

Doc ID: 24566, distribution: 0.9621883034706116 ; Question: I've never felt this alone in my entire life.All my friends left for college and I'm still in this shithole.I'm more suicidal and self hating than ever before and everytime I try to tell them how I feel they use humor or try to brush it off. honestly I'm so  desperate for any form of affection or validation,even if it is just someone listening to my whining.I really miss them but they're too busy.Your blog makes me feel a bit better tho.Ur energy radiates positivity  Answer: :( im so familiar w/ this boat. after high school i slowly lost all my friends  by , lost most of them to bad drugs (and brain damage) but lost my absolute best friend to college (and a new set of friends). the older you get, i feel like the more egocentric people tend to get, and the less sympathetic “friends” tend to be. ppl just get increasingly more involved with themselves. to the point where they arent even capable of caring or thinkin abt anything but themselves. i talk to exactly  person from high school and she used to be a “best friend” but she only wants to talk to me when its about herself, now. she'll only hang out with me when she's “off again” with her “ex”boyfriend. whenever i talk about my feelings, she ignores me or finds a way to make it about herself. or laughs it off. i know this is a common theme for a lot of people and not just you and me. its also hard to get ppl to take you serious when they're uncomfortable with a topic. i wish people would grow the fuck up , so many people are so uncomfortable with discomfort - if that makes sense. you voice your pain/discomfort and ppl immeadiately shut down, ppl dont know what to say or do anymore so they just make jokes and they dont rly engage. eventually you give up trying to have a connection with them and then you  just end up lonely n desperate. you cant talk to any of your “friends” abt how lonely n isolated u feel bc theyll just hit u with the “bUt u hAvE mEeE” lmao. and then theyll stop replying  min later.. LOL. right. it sucks bc ur trying to decide whether you should hold shit against them or not. bc on one hand theyre neglecting the friendship, but on the other hand people get busy and its not fair to hold being too busy against them. u CAN hold being an absent friend against them tho. busy or not, ppl who care make time for one another. ppl who care make an effort to listen to how you're doing.. i miss my friends sometimes too, lol. havent talked to my childhood best friend in over a year now. but its for the best. i was patient with them n they all disappointed me. people grow apart naturally, if thats whats happening, try not to let it eat u alive. it means you're evolving, even if you're the one stuck at home. im sorry u feel so isolated right now. its not a fun way to feel. the best advice i can give is to focus on refining urself for the time being. keep urself busy becoming a better person. friends come and go and we all evolve/outgrow people but the next time a friend comes along, you could be the difference in their life. you could be the friend for that person that you've been needing all this time. you can be the empathetic ear that makes the time for them, and listens when they need you to. if you can do this for other ppl, it might make u feel a lil better.. and they might return the friendship. dont expect much, tho. ppl r fickle pickles. i try n befriend coworkers n stuff bc it makes me feel better. ppl like to be listened to so if i can just like listen to my coworkers and i mean RLY listen and offer support, they LOVE that and it makes ppl love u, yano. people dont always return the favors, you might not always have someone to go to, but at least you know you're giving everyone everything you can. you can be your own friend. theres knowledge and wisdom and power in silence. you just gotta get a bit more comfortable with it. being alone isnt the worst thing in the world, especially when you have a vivid interior to keep yourself amused. im glad my blog makes u feel a little better and i hope ur able to feel peaceful n calm this week, hang in there buddy

HARD EVERY DAY AND ITS NEVER ENOUGH. apparently being terrified and shutting down/shaking/crying uncontrollably/screaming just means you need to grow up and stop blaming everyone - not that you're actually traumatized or anything from years of abuse at the hands of every man youve ever trusted in addition to many strange men who i dont even know who felt entitled to my body and time and pain. every man

(warning its a stinky process. hard to do discreetly unless u get a portable hot plate / bunsen burner apparatus in - closed room and put the burner & pot in front of an open window with a fan on). u can also sell ya stuff for money. more incentive to cook. master chef - walk somewhere.  - put a cute outfit on even if nobody gon see it - actually change and wash ur sheets weekly - scavenge for new music - get lost in the plot of a long ass, drawn out tv show. im talkin + seasons, + episodes a season.  - start collecting large cardboard boxes to put your stuff in, in case you get kicked out for standing up to your conservative/racist parents again - scheme. if you constantly think about ways to pursue money, it will eventually come to you - so long as you apply your ideas into actions.  -

@pizzeriavetri really good classic neapolitan style pizza. there's traditional flavors like margherita and pepperoni, but also some really unique flavors like the seasonal roasted lamb pizza. trust me, and order the spinach pizza here- onions, roasted garlic, mozzarella, ricotta fonduta, parmesan, and chili flakes on light yet chewy dough *chef's kiss*

@cheufishtown_nunu asian fusion ramen bar with a menu of asian inspired noodle bowls, soups, and small plates, sushi, and japanese-style pub food. great food and atmosphere. the scallion rangoons appetizer here is a must order!

@doubleknot_phl one of my all time favorite restaurants in philly that i find myself always wanting to go back to. really tasty sushi, pan-asian cuisine, and robotayaki enjoyed in an intimate underground izakaya atmosphere. a great spot for any occasion.

@charlie_was vegan restaurant serving creative plant-based small plates and excellent cocktails. my favorites were their espresso martini, ricotta, and silken tofu & mushroom ramen.

@grancaffelaquila i haven't gotten the chance to have a full dining experience here yet (although i've heard great things!), but i go just for their gelato, and it is phenomenal. my go-to flavor combo is pistachio + fondente, but i like to mix it up too, and you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors here.

TBH, I used to be so scared of egg yolks because of calories, fat, cholesterol, etc.. Now, although I don't always opt for whole eggs and still regularly add just egg whites to my meals, looove that ooey gooey yolk and all that it provides for my body.  Egg yolks provide ~% of an egg's protein content and also contain vitamins A, D, E, B, AND K as well as omega- fatty acids, & folate.  That's so much good stuff packed into a yolk that too many people choose to throw out.

i've been obsessed with @eatplantboss ever since i came across their products in the supermarket last fall. i haven't looked back since! just look at this loaded taco bowl– one of my favorite meals! i'm so excited to be partnering with their team for an amazing giveaway. Plant Boss meatless crumbles are made from organic peas and spices, so they're an excellent source of protein! they're also soy-free, non-GMO and gluten-free. but the best part about this product? it's shelf-friendly— similar to pasta or rice, Plant Boss is dried. all you have to do is soak in water for - minutes and then simmer in a skillet! this would have been a major staple for me in college for sure!

@eatplantboss and i will be giving away three Plant Boss prize packs. one grand prize winner will also win a $ gift card!

It's been so surreal to walk into a grocery store & find my own product on the shelves! So excited to see lil cartoon Bree & Mike take on Coles across the country & be easily available to those who haven't yet had the chance to discover how good these are 😍

It's still crazy to me to think that just - years ago I discovered Macro Mike & became a regular customer for a good year before I started sharing them on my story when I had about , followers. They reached out to me at that point to start working together & have believed in me ever since. So proud to be growing with this team, to have our own range (with more in the pipelines) & to be a Macro Mike Brand Hero 🦸‍♀️💛

The reason we created this range is because we wanted to offer anyone with a sweet tooth (AKA me) a healthier, more balanced dessert alternative. We created something that could be made easily (all you need is your choice of milk + a mug + a spoon) in travel sachets so you can take them with you to work, or to a friends' house, or on the road for a single serve chocolate-y mug cake (with melted choc chip pieces) within  seconds! Aaaaand I think we crushed it 🤭😍

My code: AMB-BREE will give you % off + enjoy free international shipping on orders over $!! Highly recommend stocking up & saving money on shipping since the shelf life lasts so long for all of their gluten free, vegan, all natural, high protein, macro balanced goodies!! (although I guarantee they won't last that long because they're sooooo good)

Recipe:
🧁  sachet of the @macrmike x @breeelenehan double choc mug cake (code: AMB-BREE + they're % off until :pm Thursday / tomorrow night)
🧁 -mls of nut/oat milk (I personally use oat milk)
🧁  tsp of crunchy Biscoff spread
🧁  heaped tsp of YoPro vanilla yoghurt

Method:
Mix the mug cake sachet with mylk & then scoop out a spoonful of cake mix from the centre, add a scoop of Biscoff spread to the hole you've made, then cover it with the cake mix you spooned out before. Pop in the microwave for - seconds, then add your toppings & enjoy!! 

For so long I believed that in order for me to live a “healthy lifestyle”, I had to cut chocolate & sweets out all together.. But that's not the case. It's not all-or-nothing… Balance is key! For me, as long as I'm also eating nutrient-packed foods like fruit, veg, grains, getting enough protein, carbs & fats to give my body energy… there's absolutely room for those less nutrient-dense foods too.

BUT the reason I created this mug cake range with @macrmike is because I really wanted there to be some tasty, vegan, gluten free, macro balanced, high protein & nutrient-dense sweets / snacks / dessert options too = my mug cake range is ✨ the best of both worlds ✨ & available in  flavours!

Doc ID: 23624, distribution: 0.9724627733230591 ; i havent been on here in forever but if anyone is out there and cares i finally actually got over my abusive ex boyfriend. :)

and in turn, the universe sent me the hottest, most muscular, most THOUGHTFUL ecuadorian man i've ever experienced in my  years. his name is henry and he befriends the forest animals (like tepirs, and pudus) and he swings from trees barefoot for fun. i have been spending my days translating his messages from spanish to english, learning about ecuador, practicing my spanish (i can recognize some bigger words now), teaching him english, also learning the kichwa language because he is indigenous and that is what his family speaks. 
 i dont care if i never get a passport and never go to ecuador and never meet him i just really enjoy exchanging messages and cultures with him. he's so nice, and upbeat. always saying kind things. he calls me “lady kali” because that is the direct translation of “senorita kali” and i just LOVE IT SO MUCH its so formal and cute. 
 i have to stop gushing about him on my snapchat because although my friends do seem interested as the plot thickens, i think i will annoy them with my obsession lol. 
 it's just so ironic to me. my ex wouldnt even take photos of me, and had me blocked on all social media for the duration of our  year relationship. and now i've met henry/hensh who literally asks me to send him the videos i post on my story so he can post them on HIS ALSO and show his friends :'). he thinks i am interesting and talented and he always asks me fun, simple questions like “Can you swim” “can you dance” (no and no LMAO) but i love getting to know someone on such a basic, intrinsic, simplified level. no room for arguments when you're just just trying to understand one another. 
 it just feels so pure. even though there is a language barrier i just feel this overwhelming love for his soul. the people he came from, the childhood he lived, the live he's leading, the physical place he lives in, where he plans to go, the things he does with his time, the things he chooses to share, and the words he decides to speak… i cherish everything about his story. he sends me videos often of himself in the forest and it's absolutely hypnotic listening to the sounds of the animals, birds, bugs, etc. i'd do anything to be born a part of that world. 
 but i wasn't. and i won't complain. i'm grateful to have been born in america i guess, but there is so much more to life than this. i hope i am able to make it out one day and experience even a fraction of what henry's world has to offer. everything and everywhere else is scary and unknown when you've been in america your whole life, but i am desperate to break out of my fear. i feel like my year's are running out. all this time i've wasted crying over a man who didn't care if i lived or died, prospered or suffered. stuck in this city with my mind running in the smallest of circles. 
 i had to have faith in myself and the universe, i had enough faith to barely let go. and because of that tiny bit of faith, i am here. i am free. i can see the green grass on the other side. 
 i just hope i have enough time and faith left to keep pushing myself, to keep expanding my world, to keep learning about new places and people, to learn new languages (or at LEAST just spanish)… there are just too many great things in this world to close yourself off to with only one region or language. you are missing out on so many wonderful stories when you are monolingual and do not travel. 
 i would never want to take henry out of the rainforest, i would be hesitant to even want to show him my world. i dont think he has an interest. ecuador is so rich, he really has no reason to want to see america. traveling to ecuador alone to meet a man you met online isnt the smartest idea but i'm at a point where i trust my intuition and my intuition only and perhaps my intuition is mis-calibrated but it's telling me to trust him and to have love for him, so i do. he is so welcoming, and talkative, and personable. he's never overbearing, and he never makes ME feel like i'm overbearing. i've literally never met anyone like him. 
 sometimes you really dont need words to connect with someone. sometimes you can just look at someone, even if it's through a screen. you can see them, in the images that they've chosen to portray themselves, and you can see exactly who they are and what they are about.  the words are secondary, only reaffirming the ideas that you've already begun to form about this person who just exudes boundless positive and wise energy. i just have a lot of respect for him. he's really restored my faith in humans, and shown me a different world. in such a short period of time. 
 i have a renewed confidence in myself and i have a new respect for everyone around me, even the people i wouldn't generally have respect for. i respect them in the sense that they have their place, and they belong. just in the way that i have, and now know, my place - and i know i belong. we just all have different places in the world where we belong. but all places are equally important to contribute to the greater collective functioning whole that is the human race. 
 im grateful to him for making my cold american heart, soft again. and for stretching my stagnant brain. im grateful for all the people that led me to this point. even if they did me wrong. because now that i'm here, there's no going back. and not everyone makes it here to begin with.

When I decided I wanted to share more of my story and help women transform their lives and love their story, I knew I would have to be more open and share what my offering is. Did I want to show up at first? Did I enjoy the growing pains of starting a business and not many people receiving it? Not really. But these things are just a means to a bigger end.

When I wanted to study ayurveda instead of go to med school, I knew i would have to tell my parents eventually. I knew i would have to face the discomfort of the potential rejection I'd encounter (i was not rejected lol - fears and anxieties go crazy). Did I want to tell them? Did i enjoy the HOURS of conversation about how I am not living up to my potential? Not really. But these conversations were a means to a bigger end of me living as my fullest self.

In these situations… it's not about what feels GOOD, it's about what we feel good ABOUT.

And when we do more things we feel good ABOUT, even when it gets uncomfortable, we grow wings.

📇my name is amanda, im a transformational & purpose coach, registered dietitian, Āyurvedic health counselor, and forever student of life

💍🐶my top two besties are my husband Luke & my cattledog-terrier rescue. Luke and i got married january in the magical Mayan jungle - see my “wedding” highlight! the first pic is taken by our photographer @nazul.stories

🇵🇭im a st generation filipina american, and feel so blessed to be raised in a family who stays close to their roots

🌅i currently reside outside of LA. last year Luke and i moved in with my parents to save up and to spend time with / around them. now that i've cultivated many tools, this has been so healing for my inner child 

🎨favorite color? don't know her. i tend to choose based on what “feels good at the moment”

🧘🏽‍♀️although i don't actively teach yoga right now, i am % sure my  hours of teacher training in Rishikesh were some of the most important ones of my life

🩺 one of the scariest things i did in my life was publicly pivot my path from studying Conventional Medicine to studying Āyurvedic, then to full time coaching & spiritual healing 📿 in doing this, i learned that our purpose manifests in so many ways… a joy of living is that we can enjoy each way. 

instead of thinking i've missed out on “the right path,” i now know that the one im on right now IS right.

Being a highly sensitive person (HSP) doesn't have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨

i used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!

Some (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:

🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.

🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.

👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner world and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.

👀🔎Ability to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! 

😻Appreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.

⚖️Strong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the world.

😌💭Deep self-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and self-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.

being a highly sensitive person can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make their “sensitivity” their STRENGTH 💪🏽 in living their most aligned life.

👉🏽That's where we are today.

We learn so much and pile each lesson on top of itself🏗 that it gets hard to see what is actually useful and real for us and what is not.

🏡From our parents, friends, community, social media, we accumulate a variety of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that shape our perceptions and guide our decisions. 

Some of these conditions may serve us well, but others can limit❌ our potential.

They can prevent us from reaching our full potential. 🚷

When we UNLEARN, we create space to transform and expand our own thoughts & opinions.

🚀we can open ourselves up to perspectives and ideas. 

We can break free from the past and discover new ways of thinking, feeling, & acting that align with our highest selves. 💃

we can cultivate greater self-awareness, creativity, and resilience.💞

We can find a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in our lives.

⚠️It can be challenging & uncomfortable.

⚠️It can be confronting.

⚠️It can be triggering.

But unlearning who we are NOT so we may deeper learn who we ARE can create a brighter, more fulfilling future. 🦋

The process of unlearning is an *essential* part of living life on your terms.

in my people pleasing past, i learned how to control the reactions of other people so that i could be in their favor by doing what ~i thought~ would make them happy

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others?

Doc ID: 15695, distribution: 0.9592946767807007 ; Question: Just a very open-ended question out of curiosity: how do you feel about some other (European) countries and their corona measures? Compared to the UK maybe? If you don't feel like thinking/writing about it, just ignore this question haha, it's purely out of curiosity! Answer: I find it very interesting but I just have more questions and no answers. I'm really curious for example as to why Germany has such a low mortality rate compared to the UK when I believe our healthcare systems are pretty similar. Is it an actual physical reality or is it to do with different representations of the numbers/ proportions of testing etc. I'm interested to watch Sweden and see their numbers given that they held firm against a lockdown at the point where the UK changed strategy. (Although I think we'd have had an even bigger disaster in the UK if we hadn't imposed a lockdown - and why hasn't that happened in Sweden?)Are there different mutations of the virus that have reached different countries, causing some to have higher mortality rates than others?How do genetics and population demographics impact on the death rate? Given that it's quite clear that having a higher BMI is a big independent risk factor for a poor outcome, how does that impact on the HAES movement? Why does smoking seem to be a protective factor and is this why some countries with higher proportions of smokers have lower mortality rates? What is really going on in many countries around the world whose data is suspect? And so on and so on. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15274, distribution: 0.957400381565094 ; Question: How were grades predicted? What are A-Levels typically like? Answer: So because the exams were all cancelled due to Covid, their teachers predicted the grades. And each school also had to rank all the kids in each subject from highest to lowest. So if they predicted four B grades, they had to put those four in order from the most secure to the least secure.What has happened then is that the government in its infinite wisdom devised an algorithm to “moderate” the grades, and this has basically downgraded almost half of the nation's grades from the teachers predictions, by at least one grade and in some case two or even three. It's done it by taking the rankings the teachers provided and then some other system working out how many of each grade they think the school should have got and allocating the grades via the rankings. Unfortunately the way it's worked out how many of each grades each school should have has been flawed. The algorithm has favoured private schools (where pupils pay to attend) over state schools (where the majority of average peoples kids go). Sixth form colleges have come off worst of all. It's been a stupid flawed system that has caused a lot of heartbreak today. Best case scenario, the government has to do a U-turn like in Scotland and go back to teachers predictions. This will mean kids will overall get better grades than they would have if they'd sat the exams, but at least it will feel fair and not like they're the victims of a stupid computer programme. For example at d's school, no one got an A* (the top grade) in a particular subject. That means even though her teachers predicted d an A* and she was probably the top ranked pupil in the school in that subject, the government algorithm decided that no A* were to be allocated to her school in that subject. So there was no way she could have got that grade even though she totally deserved it.Sorry I've probably lost you long ago but it's such a hot topic right now in the UK and we are so furious and disappointed for our children over how it has worked out. To make it worse, we get to do it all again in a week for d as it's the turn of GCSE results (age  exams) and it will likely be just as shambolic.As to what A-levels are typically like, two years of a lot of hard work!

We got told last week a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was arriving on Tuesday and then later that a batch of Pfizer was arriving on Wednesday. The Pfizer has to be used in three days, so we had to do ALL the AstraZeneca today.  doses. We had to open a waiting room for the waiting room, because even with the best will in the world,  vaccinators cannot get ahead with those numbers. Every time one vaccinator table paused to draw up more vaccines, or to give a little extra time to someone who needed it, the queue built up.  I did a  hour shift and walked  steps. “Next please! Hi there…. come through…. follow me…. just take a seat right here” *big smile behind mask so that it spreads to my eyes and they can see it* Return to the door. Repeat. I think I might be doing it in my sleep. I'm back there again on Friday. I think today it was the + age group as well as healthcare workers. We are moving on to people not in the top four priority groups for the next few days, I think. Tomorrow I was meant be meeting a friend in the morning for a walk and another friend in the afternoon, but because our car is stuck on our road in the snow and likewise for my friend and her car, I've had to cancel the morning friend.

Doc ID: 14936, distribution: 0.9129694700241089 ; Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start….So first we had lockdown , where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was “Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives”Then that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was “Hands, Face, Space” ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had “Eat Out to Help Out”, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system - with varying rules on what we could and couldn't do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown .. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It's not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can't meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it's the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There's a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don't follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined £, for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan.

At the time (before the September th terrorist attacks) our family lived across the country from some of our family. My family flew home (to where we live now) to be with some of our family for Christmas. An airport security employee (at one of the airports) told my mom who was wearing my sibling in a baby sling that she needed to put her bag on the X-ray machine. My mom had to explain that she was wearing a baby and show them my younger sibling. Answer: Aw 🥰 that's a cute story. Glad the baby didn't have to go through the X-ray machine in the end!We flew from the UK to Atlanta with a  month old and I found a sling super-useful for getting around in the airport and also on the aeroplane when he was unsettled.

Doc ID: 14931, distribution: 0.8826872110366821 ; Question: just curious how other countries work.. Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the “highlights” (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news. We probably hear more about US news than we hear about many other countries, but I'm sure there's loads of US news that never makes its way onto the world headlines.On the BBC and ITV, which are our two main TV channels, there's always a news programme at pm. This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a / news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don't understand the American people a lot of the time. I know the election coverage has probably shown the worst of some groups but even outside that, in general we/they seem to have a different approach to life. Having said that, I'm sure the UK is horrifying to watch at times to others too.

I went to bed last night with a box of paracetamol next to me, just in case I woke in the night all hot and cold and shivery. Woke up this morning having slept fine all night. Just got a killer sore arm, which I also had the first time round. I don't know what others think, but anecdotally the Pfizer does seem to cause more of a sore arm than the AZ. And I've heard more reports of the AZ causing generally flu-ey symptoms than the Pfizer.  So anyway, I feel ok so far. Which is good because I'm back to work at the vaccine clinic this afternoon.

Doc ID: 15934, distribution: 0.87530517578125 ; Question: Obviously in the U.K. we are isolating at home but when looking at Sweden and South Korea, it's potentially not the solution to self-isolate? I'm not saying it's right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to “normal” - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn't change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I'm not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don't know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don't know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren't yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said “The only thing worse than no test is a bad test”. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren't reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let's see what today's press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic.

Your best body is the one you have when you're living your healthiest & happiest life! It's when you're living a flexible, balanced life tailored to your physical AND mental well-being. My current body is that for me, and your “best body” may look completely different on you. 

This is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure… Having other women as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good because it's VERY likely they:
🦵 are a different height to you
🦴 have a different bone structure 
🧬 have a different genetic makeup
👙 have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, smaller waist etc)
🏋🏻‍♀️ lead different lifestyles which can lead to a completely different body composition 
🤳🏻 post posed & perfected photos for social media
📱 possibly even edit their photos before posting, etc
🙅‍♀️ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self 

You have to work with the body that you have 🥰

To finish this post off, I'm gonna leave you with ANOTHER poem that I loved recently:
“Today I asked my body what she needed…

I thought she might need more water, or protein, or greens, or yoga, or supplements, or movement.

But as I stood in the shower, reflecting on her stretch marks,
Her roundness where I would like flatness,
Her softness where I would like firmness,
All those conditioned wishes that form a bundle of never-quite-rightness,
She whispered very gently;

Could you just love me like this?”
- Hollie Holden 

Do you think you can? Leave a “🥰” in the comments if you think you can find it in yourself to accept & love yourself as you are. That doesn't mean you can't work on your health & fitness… In fact, focusing on your health is a huge form of self love.

Doc ID: 2387, distribution: 0.9708148241043091 ; We've all just witnessed the media claim that “heroin chic” is back & curvy bodies are out. But your body isn't a trend. Trends come & go. They change, DRASTICALLY, all the time. But your genetic makeup doesn't.

In  BC, women were considered beautiful for having “fertile” fuller bodies & for what their bodies could do… In , women are losing their periods due to the pressure they feel to eat less & be smaller. 

It scares me to think that I could have an entire social media page full of photos like the ones on the left & use it to sell the idea of that particular body i.e. workout/meal plans, unrealistic body expectations, or endorse products that promise a certain outcome… When truthfully, a healthy & active lifestyle = the body on the right for me & it might look like something COMPLETELY different on anyone else.

Nobody really tells you that even when you're working out & eating balanced meals, you'll still have cellulite, get bloated, have belly fat & belly rolls, stretch marks, loose skin, and all the things that still wobble & squish. Nobody tells you that those things don't need to be fixed because they're all very normal human features (which they are!!) 🫶

For this reason  years ago, these “Real Me Monday” posts were born & my life started to change forever because I realised that body/beauty trends aren't realistic, that confidence & true happiness comes from within & showing up as you are… instead of punishing your body, hiding yourself & changing the external parts of you. 

How do beauty trends make you feel about yourself? Leave a “🌹” if it doesn't impact you in any way & a “🥀” if it leaves you feeling less than/worse about yourself.

In , I hope that beauty can be more inclusive & positive & focus on within, as it should. It starts with us rejecting all the unattainable trends & the narratives that are fed to us by the media & all those who benefit ($) from making us feel bad in our skin… We've got this! ✊

Happy Real Me Monday!!! Over the past + months of me posting this series, I've received a lot of BEAUTIFUL comments, but I've also received some comments from people who think that because I'm thin, I shouldn't have a voice in this “body image” space… So I wanted to dive into that a little in today's post.

What's the difference?

Body confidence = an individual's acceptance of themselves. When we have body confidence, we accept how we look & appreciate what our bodies can do.

Body positivity = this is about acceptance of MARGINALISED bodies in society no matter their physical weight or size. 

So no, I can't speak for the body positivity movement, but I am all for it! My posts fit into the body confidence category because my body is not marginalised & is considered “socially acceptable”. So, YES I've struggled with my body image, experienced disordered eating, suffered from the pressures of diet culture & picked myself apart because of the way I looked, BUT I've also had the benefits of thin privilege too:
-I don't have people judging me for my food choices
-I don't experience judgement or harassment for my weight
-I am generally assumed to be healthy
-I've always found my size at the store 

For me, I post this series because I'd much rather showcase my body's normalities than portray perfection! I post these photos now because it's what I wish I saw when I was underweight & unhappy. I wish I knew that being thin wasn't going to make me feel confident automatically. I wish I knew that most of the photos I saw online were edited & posed to create a certain shape. I wish I realised sooner that I'm so much more than my appearance.

I hope that by seeing more REAL bodies on your feed, it might relieve the pressure you feel to conform to an impossible beauty standard & allow you to actually ENJOY YOUR LIFE!

Comment with a “🙋‍♀️/🙋‍♂️” if you've ever struggled with your body image! You're not alone, but I hope these weekly posts may encourage you along the way ✨

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Doc ID: 2571, distribution: 0.9686813354492188 ; I want you to think about the people you love most in the world… Think of their faces, how much they mean to you and why you love them.

Now picture someone telling them “You're unloveable” 
“Look at that body… Gross”
“You'd be more beautiful if you just lost a few”
“She's so much better than you”
“You should feel terrible for eating that”
“You really shouldn't be wearing that”

I mean.. First of all, THE AUDACITY. LET ME AT 'EM 😡👊

But you tell me, are you okay with someone speaking to your loved ones that way? Or are you furious that someone is going out of their way to hurt them and make them feel badly about themselves?

If that makes you so mad, why do you allow your negative inner-critic to speak to YOU that way?

Start speaking to yourself and your body like it belongs to someone you love. 

It won't be easy. It'll feel a little weird, because naturally we're our own harshest critic, but what if we became our own biggest hype girl?
What if we filled our thoughts with positive, affirming, gentler thoughts? What if we looked in the mirror or saw photos like the ones on the right where we aren't posed and think “THANK YOU BODY, FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR ME”???

Words are energy. So every time you tell yourself you aren't good enough, or get stuck comparing yourself to others, or listen to someone who tells you to eat less, or make jokes about your weight in front of others, your body takes that on board. When you change the way you speak to yourself, you'll change your life.

Doc ID: 2521, distribution: 0.9647771716117859 ; “What body shape are YOU?” the magazine cover prompted me, with images of women's bodies being compared to an hourglass, a pear, an apple, a banana, a tube, the list goes on. As if one is better than the other.

As I was growing up, it was made abundantly clear that the desirable shape was the “hourglass”, with a thigh gap, tiny waist, curves in the right places, firm & toned. It was impossible to measure up. 

So there I was as a young adult, scanning over my body in the mirror only to see a lack of curves, decorated with all of those very normal womanly features we're convinced to hate: cellulite, hip dips, bloating, stretch marks, belly rolls, thighs touching, body hair & fat on my body — which btw are all very healthy, normal parts of the human body.

So, I just wanted to remind you as you go into a new week & perhaps have some “new goals” thanks to a magazine headline like the one above… Your body is not a “shape”. 

It's a vessel that keeps you alive. 

You're here for a reason… 
To learn, love, grow, feel, teach, experience, laugh, reflect & connect
… not to simply “look pretty” or be a specific “shape” 😅🙄

For me to create the illusion that I have an hourglass body, I had to stand with my feet apart, my tummy tucked in, my arms held out, holding my hands over my thighs, EVERYTHING was tensed. My chest stretched outward & my 🍑 stuck backward. The list goes on. It's unnatural. 

Your best body is whatever body you're in when you're feeling happy, healthy, comfortable & enjoying your life.

Remember, while you're scrolling online, you're seeing everyone the way they WANT you to see them. Don't forget that the next time you find yourself comparing yourself to someone else, or setting their body as your new “goal” or standard. 

You are not them. You are uniquely you, and the world is a better place for it. 

Only you have the power to get more comfortable in your skin. Your body is your home. It's the only one you'll ever have. Nurture it, honour it, nourish it, move it, love it & respect it 💛

Doc ID: 2620, distribution: 0.9633688926696777 ; Happy Real Me Monday featuring you beautiful lot again 🌸

Most of us know by now that the standard of beauty that we're subjected to — whether it's on the internet, on TV, in magazines & so on — is usually always perfected & manipulated. So it's hard to look in the mirror & accept what we see when all we see in ourselves is all the 'flaws', lumps, bumps, rolls, flab, cellulite, acne, stretch marks & scars that these 'beautiful' women DON'T have.

So I'm just going to leave a little bit of reality right here... because your body hears everything your mind says, so take care of it — it's the only place you have to live 🦋

This Real Me Monday series is something I've been posting every week for  months, but the reason I've started encouraging YOU to be part of this series with me is because I know I can't represent all body types... I know I can't possibly be the voice of all women. But all of you deserve to feel NORMAL (and even better, feel beautiful) in your skin. I want YOU, swiping through social media right now, to see someone in this post you can relate to and think “Wow, she's amazing & so am I!” I want you to have a voice. I want to give you the platform to embrace yourself & inspire others. So here are a few of the beautiful girls who have submitted their photos to me at realmemonday@gmail.com — I'll be reposting more of them on my story too — if you see someone you can relate to, please leave a '💛' in the comments ✨

Have a happy Monday & a beautiful week!!! I'll be here with plenty of new, helpful, positive posts throughout the week to keep that ball rollin' 🙌🏼

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure… 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their “best”
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying “You are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were” so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today 🦋

Happy Real Me Monday! 💐

Doc ID: 2542, distribution: 0.9608228206634521 ; Having positive body image isn't believing your body looks good, it's believing your body IS good, regardless of how it looks! ✨

And when you start believing your body *is* good, it makes it a whole lot easier to feel more confident, comfortable & appreciative of that body. 

“But how do I start truly believing my body is good?” you might be wondering…

Well, your mind is a powerful tool. So when you declare something, your brain looks for evidence to confirm it. So if you declare: “I'm not good enough”, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative reinforcement & critical self-talk. But if you just shifted your mindset & put your energy into more positive thoughts instead, that could change your life.

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

The next time you speak down to yourself, know that ONLY YOU have the power to give yourself kindness & positivity. Your body image is a reflection of your mindset, it's influenced by what  you believe & all of the messages you tell yourself. Some of those messages will be influenced by external sources like the media, your family, friends etc but it's up to you whether you take those opinions on as your own.

For me, I'm no longer telling myself I'm only beautiful when I'm sucking in, hiding away & portraying perfection. I'm choosing to accept myself as I am & because of that, I'm constantly seeking everything in my life that reinforces that thought, I'm constantly seeking the magic in myself, and I believe it now, my body is good, it keeps me healthy & safe. It's my home 🥺

You have the power, never forget that 💛

The last decade has seen the rise of social media… It has pretty much taken over the lives of not only teenagers & adults, but younger kids too… I grew up being influenced mostly by TV, magazines, celebs, models, radio & my peers — & that did enough damage to my self-esteem — so it scares me to think about how harmful it can be to grow up today in an era of social media being accessible at your finger tips ON TOP of everything else in the media 😮‍💨 so that's why I post this series every Monday, to remind you of what's real & to gently nudge you to be kinder to yourself.

Several studies have suggested that social media exposure fosters body dissatisfaction & results in risky eating behaviour by broadcasting thinness ideals, comparison, perfection, food restriction, over-exercising & unrealistic beauty standards. And while I don't deny that I am in a thinner body myself, I'd never want to portray perfection the way I have felt pressured to in the past… I want to be a safe corner of the internet that shows up authentically & uses this platform to encourage you to be kinder to yourself 💛

Let's not continue feeding the message that belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, blemishes, skin conditions, belly rolls, wobbly bits, body hair, skin colour, hair type, body shape, etc needs to be “fixed” or changed. None of those things make you “less than”. Our individuality is our magic!! Leave a “📱” below if you agree!! Have the best week my loves 🫶

- improves cholesterol levels by lowering total and  LDL (the bad) cholesterol
- the high amount of antioxidants can counteract the damaging effects of inflammation and oxidation in brain cells, improving memory and learning
- nutrient dense, containing chromium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus with only  calories per g

ACAI DRAWBACKS - theyre not the only source of antioxidants
- can make a dent in your wallet
- may be made with sneaky added sugars

TLDR- MY OPINION

Acai smoothies or bowls are a great way to cool down on a hot day and add in extra antioxidants that can improve so many functions (immunity, skin, digestion, memory/learning) but arent necessary to love a healthy lifestyle. I personally like to get acai bowls when I'm out as a treat (shoutout to @cafegratitude for this Vibrant bowl) and when I'm home I stick to the basic bananas and berries for my smoothie bowls. Plus there's something magical about the experience of getting an acai bowl ❤️ admittedly they are cheaper if you make em at home but I like the whole shebang. do you make your own acai bowls at home? #amandasacaiadventures #acaibowl #cafegratitude #blessedretreat #MyBlessingLA #vegan #acai #acainutrition

I feel like a loser like I'm not % sick or % recovering, I can't fast for days like before but as the same time I'm not responding to my hunger cure at the time like what I did at the beginning of my recovery. At that time I was so determined. I'm neither “successful” in having an ed nor recovering. Sorry if this triggered anyone, stay safe sending virtual hugs:) Answer: (my writing can come across as aggressive sometimes so im saying this now to make sure we're cool: im not mad at you at all. Im happy you sent this. This mini rant is not directed to you personally, i promise. youre cool as hell. )man everybody really needs to stop assigning rankings and levels to eating disorders and recovery. theres no leveling system for how bad an ed is or successful recovery is. theres no percentage. thats all made up to make you feel like shit. theres no such thing as % sick or % sick or % sick. either you are sick or you are not. either you are struggling or you are not. The fact that you even entered recovery in the first place PROVES you were sick. Who the fuck cares ““what percentage”“ of sick you were. that shit isnt real. Your ed just wants you to feel like ass and pretend it was never “that bad” so you'll come back to it. its all a manipulation tactic. its bullshit. “Sorry you have % cancer, not enough for any kind of treatment, we are gonna wait until you waste away to % cancer to do anything about it” ??????????? thats not how this works. and on the topic of quasi recovery.. i see that shit everywhere. and so many people slip into it when they get the idea that they werent % sick to begin with.. so they cling to the ed, because maybe THIS TIME they WILL be % sick enough.. but they disguise it as recovery to make everyone else happy. Its not a good place to be. Never build your mental health on lies. Its REALLY great that you noticed this and are aware of it. REALLY great. Because you now have the choice to take the next step toward real recovery and the next step AWAY from ed. “% recovery” is just living without an eating disorder. and that shit takes WORK. hard work. I want you to know youre feelings about it are normal. it happens waayy too often i promise you, youre not a loser or faking anything. Normies dont question themselves like this. Normies dont even consider questioning themselves like this. All sickness needs healing no matter what degree of pain someone is in.

Doc ID: 8922, distribution: 0.9535863995552063 ; is it possible to start intuitive eating without gaining weight? let's dive into it!

Intuitive Eating is a self-care eating framework, which brings together instinct, emotion, and rational thought. 

Unlike diets, it doesn't guarantee weight loss/gain 

We all have unique set points- a preset weight baseline wired to our DNA. 

Just like we all have unique foot sizes and shapes, we all have unique waist sizes and weights. 

The first step to intuitive eating is actually to reject the Diet Mentality. this step requires that any goals of weight loss be put on the back burner or eliminated right away because the motivation to lose weight can interfere with the process. imagine you are trying to reject the diet mentality but so focused on losing weight that anything which ~isn't~ a diet doesn't seem feasible for you.

focusing on weight loss also gets in the way of finally making peace with foods that you find yourself restricting and then binging later after your efforts to never eat carbs again goes to 💩

a part of Making Peace with Food for many (including myself) is weight gain, because they are finally eating what they've restricted for so long. eventually they get over the allure and realize it doesn't feel so great to eat a whole cake all the time.

in order to GET to that step and to feel like you are finally not controlled by your "cravings," however, you HAVE to let go of wanting to lose weight.

the good news is: along the way you learn how to Respect your Hunger & Fullness, Cope w/ Emotions Without Food, and incorporate movement you truly enjoy

Many actually end up effortlessly losing weight after the gain because they find they actually don't want to eat that whole chocolate cake every night and it was the “rules” that made it seem so enticing.

Some might gain weight & keep it - mostly because they were trying so hard to maintain a shape that wasn't meant for them. 

Intuitive Eating teaches that it wouldn't be fair to ourselves and our quality of life to try to fit a certain shape- just like it wouldn't be fair to try squeezing on a pair of size  shoes as a person with size  feet.

you won't have to follow anyone else's plan but your own ;)

Doc ID: 13506, distribution: 0.9472030401229858 ; Question: You suffered with binge eating disorder? How did you get over it? Answer: toethefinishline:
Okay. So I am not exactly sure how I beat it- like there is not a simple solution or anything! And it takes time. You will gradually get better and relapse every once in awhile but hopefully you can get to the point i am at today! Binge free for over a year and a half!
To start I came to the realization that some days I would be eating - calories all of them processed, sugary, non nutritional, gross foods. And before I had the disorder I would restrict, eating no more than - calories per day if even that many. So this was a HUGE change for me! I went from  pounds to  over the  months! And from basically no calories per day to a few thousand! It was awful! And I was trying to look good for my vacation so I told myself every day that today is the last day I will binge- tomorrow I will fast! But each day I would try to fast and be consumed by thoughts of food and eating. And it continually got worse! I remember this one specific instance sitting in my last class for the day that had just started and I craved cheese cake. The class dragged on so slowly and I couldn't concentrate because I just wanted to eat and when I came home I ate the rest of the cheese cake in my freezer and I felt so sick. And I thought “okay. the cheese cake is gone so the temptation is gone and starting now I will fast” but of course dinner came and I found something else to eat! Some nights I would have sugar cravings and I would go to the kitchen get the flour, sugar, vanilla, and water and make a disgusting cookie dough type of thing that was pure sugar and eat it just like that ! it was awful but I just could not control it!
I finally came to the realization that i didn't have to fast or diet or restrict to lose weight. I mean I was eating over  calories almost everyday so obviously if I just cut down to  or  (a healthy amount) i would still lose weight. From there I completely switched everything! All of my goals! I no longer wanted skinny. I wanted fit. I redid my tumblr, unfollowed any triggering/unhealthy blogs and joined the fitblrs(bet decision ever!) And I made some friends and found a weight loss buddy and we made healthy plans together! I made a new grocery list consisting of fruits, veggies, healthy dinners, and little treats. So i would still enjoy myself and not feel deprived. I began exercising again - since i rarely did while i had binge eating disorder. I managed the stress of school by not procrastinating as much and doing my work during lunch and free time in class so when I came home I didn't have so much to do. And I made new goals for myself. I wanted to become a runner, stop binging, eat healthy by choice, become a weight lifter, to be fit, to have abs, and have better endurance. They are all still my goals and I have only completed a few. this all takes time but the good thing is that my binging has ended.
I found that once I centered my goals and my life on health- I stopped focusing on the scale and on calorie counting it helped! The numbers do NOT matter! The number I was concerned with was how many days I went binge free! And don't start by aiming to never binge again! Start small. Go for  days, then , then  - whatever you want! just aim to go longer than you did before!
Why I stopped focusing on the scale and calorie counting: The number on the scale does not matter at all ! End of story. It doesn't measure your self worth or your beauty. It is just a number. There is nothing to it. You need to focus on how you feel and what you eat. I NEVER calorie count anymore because the numbers got way too obsessive for me! I would try to have low sodium, low fat, low carbs, low sugars, but enough calories. and it was impossible! And the days I saw that I had too many of one of those I would be like “fuck it! i have already ruined my day so i will just eat whatever i want” then i would binge! And the days i didn't eat enough I would try to make dinner larger and then it would be huge and awful and it would make me binge then too! So I stopped counting calories!
I just made a healthy meal plan of foods that I should try to eat more often: oatmeal, fruits, veggies, green smoothies, luna bars, greek yogurt, eggs, etc. And I started to make a meal plan. Once I got into the habit of the meal plan it would get easier. Some treats I enjoy are soy ice cream and pita chips- I usually have one treat a day and i don't even portion it typically. I eat what I want and put it away. I figure it is better than what i was doing before and I need to enjoy myself. If you set too many restrictions on yourself you will binge! I tried going vegan but I realized how restrictive that is and it made it really hard so I stopped because I knew I wasn't ready for it and I honestly don't think I am ready even now after so long. I do NOT diet because I know that I will binge. This is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE. You need to be healthy for you and only for you. So you will feel better and be healthier, as a result you will look better too! But you cannot be doing this for the looks! And you need to realize this won't happen overnight! You must be patient and be proud of yourself ! It is such a wonderful feeling going days without binging and you will be so proud and the exercise will make you feel great and eating right will too!
So for main points:
Do NOT count calories.
Do NOT diet/restrict at all!
Do NOT weight yourself.
Find a weight loss buddy.
Drink lots of water!
Treat yourself everyday to something you love!
Set new and healthy goals for yourself!
Focus on being fit and healthy - not skinny.
Fill your tumblr with healthy motivation!
You can even open up to your family and get their help for this! I am sure it would've helped if I had told mine but I couldn't and they still don't know! But they will be able to support you with healthy eating and maybe even find a nutritionist you can talk to!
Also clear out all tempting foods that cause you to binge! I no longer have cheese cake at my house nor do I buy fiber one mocha bars (because my mom would buy them and i would eat one then always eat the whole box. I still don't trust myself with them so I just leave them at the store! Someone else can enjoy them!).
I hope this answer helps! I am not sure if it will - let me know if there is anything I didn't answer or any other way I can help ! I am sorry I kind of rambled but I was trying to cover everything and as I said this is a really hard question to answer!

Doc ID: 8001, distribution: 0.943665623664856 ; refeeding. in the eating disorder space, it's rarely touched on yet common in most recoveries. but what is it?
.
every recovery is different. personally, my recovery was from a restrictive battle with food. i had lost nearly half my body weight, and this time called for restoring weight. a lot of it.
.
when i finally began to eat again, i was afraid that the self-control i had cultivated over  four years would be “ruined”. that i wouldn't be able to compose myself when faced with a full plate. for too long, eating was an all or nothing task, and now that it couldn't be nothing, it had to be all.
.
i've been asked if i experienced “binge eating” in recovery, and here's where refeeding comes in. when the body is deprived of food for a long time and then food is reintroduced, it gets…excited. my body wanted to make up for all of those starving days and grumbling nights. .
for years i had tinkered with my body's natural messages. part of my recovery was relearning hunger cues. after awhile, they had disappeared, and now that i was calling them back home, they had to readjust. and they weren't exactly accurate. .
this isn't unhealthy. there is a learning period that comes with recovery, and feeling hungry even after a dense meal is not WRONG. your body learning its hunger cues is like you learning to do a math problem. both take practice and there will be errors along the way. but eventually, things begin to click.
.
when i was refeeding, i would eat large meals and feel hunger ten minutes later. i would grow frustrated with myself, angry for not being “normal”, scared that i was eating “too much”. i remember trying to rationalize with my body. “you can't possibly be hungry you JUST ate”.
.
what would i do? i would eat more, because my body was asking for it. the entire time i was miserable, confused, to be so full and yet so hungry. but i ate, because i had to show up for my body, had to allow it to fall before it could stand.
.
all of that just to say that recovery is a learning process. there is no correct way to recover. your body was subject to trauma, and now it needs to find its way back home. it's during times of discomfort that we grow the most 💫

Doc ID: 9614, distribution: 0.9400115013122559 ; a note on eating disorders and eating disorder recovery:

eating disorders aren't just about food. eating disorders are not just a result of diet culture. eating disorder recovery isn't simply about eating without restrictions.

eating disorders are MENTAL illnesses that are characterized by eating behavior disturbances and related thoughts and emotions, and to really truly recover, there's often a lot to unpack and a lot of inner work to do.

especially with “recovery influencers” on social media, it can sometimes seem like recovery is simple and that there's a textbook straightforward way to recover. right now, that way is through going “all in”.

if you didn't know, over a year ago, i went “all in” (i have a highlight with some posts about my experiences), but for me, it was primarily to try and gain weight and get more in tune with my body, not to heal my relationship to food (which i did prior). it doesn't really matter to me if you consider me going “all in” a part of my recovery or not because the labels don't really matter, but my point is that most of my progress with healing my relationship to food was not done by simply eating it. for some people, the “all in” method of recovery works, and that's great! but, i think it's important to recognize that it's not the only way, and if you can't go “all in” with your circumstances, your recovery is still valid and worth pursuing. 

i know i've probably said things along the lines of “just choose food freedom!” because i no longer view myself as a “recovery account” and rather someone just promoting self-acceptance, self-care, and living a full life, but if i've ever made any of you who are in recovery feel invalidated, i am truly sorry because i know recovery is not that simple.

to those of you in recovery: I SEE YOU, and i am so proud of you for fighting. healing isn't linear, and even when you feel like you're going backwards or not making progress, i promise that you are still growing. your recovery doesn't have to be “instagrammable” to be worthy- in fact, if it's not “instagrammable”, you're probably doing it right. please keep going. i am rooting for you and hope you remember that every win counts.

 I have a history of using the gym for evil and really overdoing it. How I am right now after avoiding the gym for so long, is very out of shape and weak and pathetic. Muscles? Who's she. Stamina? Don't know her. Physical health?? make it make sense. 
 cont. under read more:  Anyways with this self isolation thing going on part of me wants to help myself get in better shape, I mean my lb dog makes my arms give out. when I say im out of shape, i mean my muscles are threads and going up  steps leaves me winded. Im not talking about “summer body toned” i mean literally i have like no strength at all my muscles are just paper. I cant even stand in the kitchen to cook without needing to sit down before I pass out. 

But how do I get healthy when I cant even control myself in exercise mode? Theres such a thin line between “im doing the correct amount and thats perfectly fine” and “work out until all i see is white and I wake up on the floor”

I just want to be normal. I want to have normal strength. Normal stamina. I want my body to be human. Instead Im a soggy tissue and trying to better myself only ends in the eating disorder taking over. I feel that way about ever attempt to better myself.. work out? Ed ruins it. Eat healthy? Ed ruins it. Eat more? Ed ruins it. Eat less? Ed ruins it. Drink more water? Ed ruins it. Every time I try to just be normal, Ed pushes it to the extreme in any direction and ruins it. I look normal. talking about it with people isnt really helpful. No one believes me and they always try to convince me that im lying. They overestimate my abilities just because of how i look. bro theres no muscle under my skin its just fat. take a squeeze lmao not even lying…. I wish I could change it. I used to play sports wtf.. Ive been trying to do At Home work outs… I hate it. Ive always hated exercising. I only did it for hours to punish myself. It has never been enjoyable. And at home Im struggling to get anything going, because i hate it so much but i also am afraid if I give effort im going to overdo it like always. There's no balance. Its shitty no matter what I do so I tend to get ultra depressed and avoid it. 
 bringing me back here, complaining I cant do anything right and help myself. I feel like I wont live that long unless I get my act together and get healthier. but hOooOwwWW…….

Its like the coalescence of my entire ed, my bulimia. I dont fix binge eating by counting calories. I dont get out of a binge cycle by counting calories. Binge eating isnt about calories, its not about WHAT i eat its HOW i eat it. I can binge eat on fucking ice cubes. I need to address the mental and emotional problems that cause me to binge, not eat at so and so healthy amount or else. Eating a meal that is high in calories isnt the same as devouring food uncontrollably as i attempt to fill the void. I have to learn to eat comfortably no matter the calories in it. Dont bring calories into this. Thats just asking for failure. Fix the mind first, the body will follow after. Fix the mind first i wont have the desire to binge eat. Without the desire to binge eat my body can heal. The only reason calories are counted is for the desire to lose weight and undo the binging. That wont fix anything. Thats not recovery. Thats attempting to keep control over food. That mentality is still disordered whether i like it or not. Bro. Get real. Fixing my body before fixing my mind is the biggest waste of time and energy. Whats the point. Literally. What is the actual point.Im not excused from the laws of nature and the science of the mind. No one is. Logic before Ed. Im not special. My brain works like a brain and im not an exclusion to logic or even self awareness for that matter

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.93836909532547 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

I think about all these things all the time, about how good or bad they are (/)  Answer: im trying really hard to fight these thoughts and at this point I'm going have to find a way to stop myself from researching about weight loss and what method is best or whatever, my doctor is monitoring my weight loss to make sure I'm doing it safely and that helps at least, how can I avoid engaging with all of this content that's triggerering but I literally can't stop watching it and looking at it? and at the same time keeping some motivation so I don't give up? god this is so fucking hard  (/) hi! honestly this is something that i struggle with as well. i try my best to remind myself that food has no moral value and that i am feeding myself healthy foods not because it will make me “pure” or anything but that i'm doing to fuel my body. mental health and physical health are so tangled and related in such complicated ways. i find that the more i try to push unwanted thoughts away the more they pop up and the harder it is to not fixate on them. it's really hard but i've found that it's helpful to try to challenge those thoughts and reframe it so that it's less about control and coping and more about eating in a balanced way. maybe you could try meeting with a dietician or nutritionist if that's an option financially. that helped me learn a lot about what foods i need to eat for my body based on a lot of different things. make sure you're not watching the videos to “trigger” yourself into restricting bc that could quickly turn unhealthy if it hasn't already. think about why you're watching those videos and what purpose it serves. remember that food and water are necessary for your body. food is fuel and it's all about balance. it is not meant that be used as a coping mechanism. i hope this was helpful and feel free to reach out if it wasn't.

There's so much stigma against aging and weight gain, but it's so unrealistic! Those things are inevitable parts of life! Bodies are weird fleshy blobs that stretch and sag with time, and we shouldn't fear or demonize something that should be considered so beautiful, I mean how cool is it that we can show our wisdom on our skin?
Exactly! We dont need to waste our time going against the laws of nature. Everything ages. Thats how its supposed to be. My dog is old squishy and saggy and i have never loved anything or anyone more than i love him, just the way he is. I owe it to myself to love my body the same.

present me: desires ice cream —> eats ice cream —> feels happy and satisfied 

note: feeling satisfied doesn't mean i don't eat more after. if i still desire whatever food after i eat, i continue to honor that!

honoring your food desires can feel really scary after a period of restriction and when diet culture tells you that there is a ~healthier alternative~ that you “should” eat instead, but lemme tell ya that eating what you actually want to eat and not overthinking and worrying about every food decision you make leads to being so much happier.

recovery is worth it.
food freedom is worth it.
fighting against a culture where weight bias and thin privilege are very real and present is worth it.
showing up as you are in a society that profits off your insecurities is worth it.

keep going. it is worth it, i promise.

Doc ID: 10250, distribution: 0.8044828176498413 ; i've seen, heard, AND encouraged the saying, “food is fuel,” many times. of course, food is fuel- we need it so our brains can function and bodies can work.  but, food isn't just fuel, and viewing food as just fuel is like viewing sex as just reproduction or words as just words.  here are some ways food is so much more than fuel and why viewing it as such might be counterintuitive to you trying to “control yourself”:
.
.
food is emotional whether you like it or not: there is aaalways going to be a part of me that loves ramen because it's what my dad would make for me on lazy saturday mornings and holds emotional significance in my life.  maybe ramen will always be something i eat for a feeling of nostalgia and comfort, and that is OK
.
.
pleasure is important!: when we deny ourselves of foods we enjoy and eat what we “think we should,” we usually end up daydreaming of pizza and oreos, feeling constantly unsatisfied, and then “falling off the wagon,” which, for me, results in shoving food in my face to try and drown out the “i'm a failure” voice in my head.  i think so many of us think of food first as fuel and not a source of pleasure because we're afraid that if we start approaching food from a place of pleasure that we won't make smart, nutritious choices.  from my experience though, when i fall back into a cycle of binge eating, it's not because i'm coming at it from a place of pleasure. it's because i'm coming at it from a place of shame, stress, guilt, or some combination of the three
.
.
thinking that food is just fuel is setting you up for shame: food is an inherent part of cultural, social, and emotional experiences, and not acknowledging that mashed potatoes will always be a part of thanksgiving, gelato will always be a part of traveling to italy, multiple courses will always be a part of nice dinners will just make us feel guilty and unable to fully enjoy LIFE.
.
.
yes, food is fuel. but, food also brings people together, creates memories, is medicine, tells a story, and is so much more

but, what's the rush? it's a new day and a new week, but that doesn't mean i “should” be feeling refreshed, inspired, or motivated like we are often told. our nervous systems have been on overload for the past  months, and all feelings are valid, always.

here's your monday morning reminder to slowwww downnnn, resist the urge to go through life so urgently, release expectations, and take care of yourself. 

today is today. whatever that ends up looking like is always good enough.

living your fullest life doesn't have to do with attending holiday parties, receiving expensive gifts, being surrounded by a lot of people, making fancy cocktails, looking or dressing a certain way, or even being merry and cheery.

living your fullest life is about quality over quantity, staying true to yourself, finding purpose, being present, and knowing peace.

the people who are truly living their fullest life aren't the ones who are always trying to prove it.

maybe this year threw you a bunch of curve balls you weren't prepared for.
maybe you aren't where you want to be.
maybe the holiday season this year looks different for you.
maybe the future remains uncertain.
maybe you just feel really down.

you can still work towards the things you want, be grateful for what you have and who you are, have hope for what's to come, and prioritize living YOUR fullest life anyway ✨

just because if you ordered the salad out at dinner, it would be because you felt anxious about eating pizza doesn't mean that if your mom chooses the salad at dinner, it's for the same reasons.

just because tracking food for you would be a disordered behavior doesn't mean that your friend who tracks their macros struggles with an unhealthy relationship with food.

just because you see certain actions in black and white doesn't mean that everyone else does too, and that's OKAY.

ALSO, even if you know that someone in your life does have an unhealthy relationship with food, understand that everyone is on their own journey, recognize when it is or isn't your place to say something, and know that other people's food decisions don't have to take up so much mental space in YOUR mind and impact the actions YOU take because at the end of the day, the person you're taking care of most is yourself.

moral of the story: keep your eyes on your own freaking plate, stop comparing, and do what's best for you.

choosing recovery and/or pursuing food freedom can sometimes be made out to seem simple and easy. they aren't. in fact, choosing food freedom in a society with body ideals is really really hard. but, it's definitely worth it, and here are some reasons why:

- the ability to be spontaneous
- more mental space for things you care about
- better mood
- being present
- connecting with others
- more energy
- better focus on important tasks
- being more in tune with your body
- feeling empowered
- enjoying new foods and drinks

& many more!

dieting (restricting one's food amounts or types) is not only not sustainable, but also is not health-promoting.  while there a lot of different risk factors for eating disorders, dieting is a primary one and was what was the catalyst for my own eating disorder journey.

today is international no diet day, and in a society where dieting is so normalized, i hope we can bring more awareness to the harm it causes. while i am anti-diet everyday, today is a day about reclaiming, celebrating, and honoring our bodies and saying no to diets, which i am allllllll about.

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - sautéed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream.

- next i make my classic hummus dressing with a green goddess twist. i steamed  cup of peas in the microwave for one minute before adding to the blender with a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!

-
This city was one of my favourite destinations here in Thailand last year, so I'm super happy to be back 🙈 I definitely didn't experience the °C heat though when I last visited, so the sweating, continuous consumption of water and crazy tomato face is all new this time round 😅🥵
-
As you guys know I'm currently training for Phuket Marathon in early June and I've been doing a lot of my running recently in my new @snuggs active cut period underwear. It's amazing for when I'm on my period, but I do also wear it day-to-day because it's so incredibly comfy!!
-
It's designed for sports and an active lifestyle, and the softness is unreallllll you guys. It's made from recycled nylon so it doesn't rub or chafe, even when I'm sweating buckets on my runs or just out and about walking in the midday heat (bum sweat is no joke ok 😂) 👌🏻
-
I've also completed the @snuggs x @strava #SnuggsPeriodChallenge this month in May, where you need to complete just a minimum of  minuets of activity . . . which could literally be *anything* you guys!!! You'll get a promo code (KUDOSTOPERIODS) to use to purchase Snuggs underwear as soon as you sign up to Strava (for free 🤓), plus a discount of % once complete ✅ #onperiod #SnuggsPeriodChallenge

Being in Chiang Mai for around about two weeks definitely means that we're properly able to 'live' in the city, find out little routines and get to know the area 🏃🏻‍♀️🍌 The vegan scene here in Chiang Mai is also super good, so I'm excited to try more amazing food 😍
-
Stay tuned for more Chiang Mai updates and ps: Angelo obviously beat me down the stairs in the lift because his legs are that long lol 🙃😅 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 11171, distribution: 0.9466043710708618 ; So let's break the news: I have just under  weeks left here in Australia now and I am definitely starting to get quite emotional. Whilst @veganmutti sent me the cutest pictures of Bali ad Java the other day and the realities of being so far away from home suddenly came flooding back to me, there's just something so special about this place on the other side of the world that I simply love. It's the beaches, the sun, my (tiny) tan, the ocean, the wildlife … gahhhh there is literally so much that I'm going to miss.
-
It's also very likely that I'll be landing back in the UK and hit by full-on winter weather (because the seasons and climate, as we all probably know, are a bit screwed up). The temperature contrast will be pretty shocking and my tan will probably fade all too quickly. So after  months of building up a bit of a glow, it will be gone in just a few days I'm afraid, and that in itself makes me very very sad 😳😭
-
When I realised the other day that my first big solo adventure was coming to an end pretty soon, I was like this. is. it. I have to make the most of every last second I've got here, and ngl, I think I've done pretty well. Here in Byron Bay, I made a list of all my 'bucket list' activities and I've been ticking them off faster than the spread of coronavirus if I'm completely honest (a global pandemic we should not take lightly I know, but just a useful comparison, sorry I couldn't resist 🙃). And despite bad news the other day with one of my courses being cancelled, I've still managed to find a way to swim with the fish again 🐠 (all coming soon in the next vlog 😉).
-
Tomorrow, if all goes to plan, I'm attempting to eat out for all  meals as I've already mentioned. I'm pumped for some epic vegan food, but I do still have some decisions to make because there are waaaaaaaay way too may good eateries to try here in Byron. I'm spoilt for choice and drooling over every menu. The prices, well, I'm not a fan of, but the food is there to be enjoyed, right? 😝
-
And a final note. I'm still thinking about doing the meet up in Sydney, so it's not yet off the cards! I'll try and send updates as soon as possible ✌🏻

-
I would have stayed for longer but we did have return flights booked because (a) the visa exemption for UK residents in Thailand is only a month and (b) I have to be back for laser lol (it's always slightly awkward telling people that when they're like “Holly you can just extend your stay!!!” 😅

Most importantly and rest assured, this series is *far* from complete ok 🙌🏻 There's still five vlogs according to my plan and then all of the round-up content after that: so the big Thailand Q&A, how I planned my trip and a full budget break down (I've literally kept track of everything 😉)💰
-
I'll therefore be spending a lot of this week editing so make sure you have the notification bell on, because lots of videos are coming your way and I'm so excited for you to see them all 🤩 Oh and I've still got a camera roll filled with pics and reels (rip storage 😂) 🤟🏻
-
If you have any questions about our trip then feel free to get thinking or send them my way! I'm going to be doing little summaries of the different locations on my stories (just know that I'm now at home haha 🙈), and I'll then catch you up on home life in the weekly vlogs . . . I hope this will all make sense 😂

Doc ID: 11298, distribution: 0.9167952537536621 ; Monday blues or Monday BLUES ...... Guys I am officially a Cambridge BLUE 😱 Ok so to many of you that means completely nothing, but it means quite a lot to me and the rest of the dance squad 💙 Essentially, students at Cambridge and Oxford can be awarded blues status for competing at the highest level in a particular sport. Now I've never really seen dance as a sport shall we say, however just because we 'prance' around in leotards and pink tights does NOT mean we don't work our little booties off training, perfecting routines, stretching .... you know the drill. We might not be as macho as rugby players or have biceps like rowers, but that does not mean dancers should not qualify for blues.
•
So as I've alluded to above, many sports teams automatically get blues for their whole team. Every single member in many cases will get a blue. That includes rowing for example (standard 😑) but also the cheerleaders (who qualified last year) and what is called 'dance sport' in Cambridge (which I think is ballroom). HOWEVER our competition team STILL does not qualify for blues status. Ok we haven't competed in five varsity matches yet, which is another requirement apparently (🙄) but what is most frustrating for us is that, how can cheerleading and ballroom get blues and we can't? They are so similar!?!
•
I'm sorry for the rant, but I am still not done 😂 ..... Now you're probably wondering, how did I get a blue, along with two other of my dance gals? Essentially, we had to apply for 'extraordinary' blues. We all had to fill in an application and then present them to the blues committee. Pretty intimidating. I wasn't there, but I thank @myzteriouspeach and @bethhermi 🙌🏻
•
Next year the competition team should be able to apply for full blues status because we will have then competed in five varsity matches. However I don't think it's going to be easy getting blues for at least  people who are on the competition team 😅😢 We've got to try though, and keep making progress in getting dance officially recognised as a competitive ART FORM ✨ It is more than just a sport you know 😏👯‍♀️

Doc ID: 10963, distribution: 0.9167155027389526 ; *the final* DAY IN MY LIFE backpacking THAILAND 🇹🇭😭🍍
-
Rest assured, it's just the final mini vlog from *this* travel series ok . . . I'll be back with my rucksack on in no time 😉 This is your final piece to the puzzle, because across both YouTube and Instagram I've pretty much vlogged every single day for this month trip (except when we were both ill 😴)!!
-
We left Koh Tao, where we did scuba diving with @lbdivingkohtao (episode  on YouTube), and travelled back to Bangkok. Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I'd recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I'd organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map 😅)!
-
Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani 😱😳 Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive 😂 But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today's vlog on YouTube (episode , live @ pm) 😏 I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it! I thought it would be more refreshing than it was, but it literally tasted like sweets to me in a liquid form lol 😆
-
-Eleven is always pulling through with the best snacks and quick food when you need it, and our final stay in Bangkok was in the Siam district with @lubdbangkoksiam ✌🏻 Make sure you watch out for today's vlog on YouTube, our final  hours in Thailand, and the moving home video coming out *tomorrow* with lots of family surprises 🤩
-
ps: i planned this whole itinerary myself, and i know you guys have lots of questions, but our diving in Koh Tao and stays with Lub D were both gifted to @matt.j.white and I very last minute (I was messaged by both whilst on our travels) 🙈✨

-
() The penguins. Hands-down, they were the highlight of Melbourne for me. I don't need to say anything else! () Seeing and feeding kangaroos for the first time 🦘() My top fun fact is that in any emergency, all the trams receive a signal to stop so that the emergency services can utilise the tram lanes and arrive in the place they need to be as quickly as possible. I think this is such a neat idea! () Sweaty runs around the parks in the morning have been so refreshing and the best way for me to de-stress and settle any feelings of anxiety or homesickness. () The fruit at the Queen Victoria market is goooooold. Oh my goodness I am so glad I came in mango season, you guys, I've literally never tasted better mangoes before in my life. () The ballerina I found in the street art was a cute little addition to our laneway tour. ) The view of the skyline from the rooftop bar never gets old and () neither do the beaches ☀️
-
Of course I'll take many more memories away from my first official tour in Australia, but these are just some of the small things that came to mind earlier today when I wrote my first diary entry. As I said on my story, I am currently working on the next couple of videos which I am super hyped about. And to be honest, I am so excited to share this whole trip with you guys, as you can probably tell! The next few weeks (… and months) are going to be non-stop crazy, but now that I'm starting to feel better in myself, I am really starting to embrace this huge adventure on the other side of the world. I just keep telling myself that it was my dream to come here … so I have to make most of it!

-
So I was running last year when I was here, but wow it's a lot harder let me tell you that!! 😬 The heat and the humidity is crazyyyyyy you guys 🌞
-
We wake up pretty early to get a run in first thing, and then our evening runs are after sunset to avoid the sun. These feel easier, although I can't lie, running has never felt tougher 😅 We also planned to do K on our first Sunday here, but it was literally impossible, and we also ran out of water / salt tablets so we didn't have any other option but to stop 😳
-
I'll share with you guys some very exciting news tomorrow, because I am currently training for a race here in Thailand . . . and it will be the toughest race I've ever done for sure 🙈 But for now, enjoy watching me sweat, turn into a tomato and almost collapse at the taste of orange juice during this K run 😂🍊

I now sincerely apologise for every single complaint I've made about the UK cold weather because that sounds quite nice to me right now!!
-
This is a little dump from our flight and first half day in Bangkok after we were released from quarantine👌🏻 Vlog number one (leaving home and arriving in the city) will also be out very soon, as I wanted to post my packing video first, but I've been very quiet on here because (a) I still can't get my head around the time difference 🤦🏻‍♀️😅 and (b) there has been a pretty big disaster 😬 I feel so so bad for Matthew right now and the problem is ongoing, which has been stressful and it's meant we're both not fully able to enjoy the trip sadly 😢

*breathes* ... Hello friends! Wow life is crazy right now. Never in a million years did I ever think I'd be cramming all my most essentials belongings in just two bags and leaving to go solo travelling. This has been in the pipeline since July this year, and I'm now just two days away from sitting on that plane and flying (many miles) away from home.
-
I have very mixed feelings. A bit stressed. Anxious. Nervous. But I am just trying to go with an open mind. Opportunities likes this don't come around very often, and I have to be confident in myself that I can navigate an airport. Talk to new people. Make friends. And simply be myself ... just in a very new environment, that's all 😉
-
As I said in my last weekly vlog, my new hair has given me this new found inner confidence. It was certainly needed after a few low days, and it is something I definitely need when travelling.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

peanut butter and pretzels AND chocolate… i'm crying this is a trifecta if i ever saw one.

if you haven't caught on by now, no-bake recipes are my main character trait hahaha. this one is a keeper. THOSE LAYERS 🤩

no-bake triple layer pb pretzel brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- / cup mini gluten free pretzels, chopped into piece
- / cup creamy salted peanut butter
-  tbsp vanilla protein powder of choice OR  tbsp oat flour   
add the crushed pretzels and peanut butter to a bowl and mix until well coated. stir through the protein powder or oat flour to thicken up the mixture and spread onto the base layer.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 0.9767875075340271 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.97386234998703 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

She asked me if I was ok, because she said I seemed a bit flat. I said no I'm ok. I was suddenly a bit tearful because it felt like she'd said hi so gently, as if she knew it was going to be a tough session, and the quietness in her voice caught me a bit unexpectedly.  “Do you have any things to talk about on your list today?” I shook my head “Ok so shall we talk about this story that you sent me?” I nodded and T pulled across a print out of it she had right there next to her. “How did it feel to write this?” “Uh…. well I didn't set out to write that, what it turned out to be. I sat down to try and put into words something I had been thinking about.” “Ok, what were you trying to write?” “Uh… so at the end of last session, I said [insert a slightly confused and jarbled retelling of the conversation], and I think up till then I'd felt like you were kind of neutral on what went on in my childhood. Like, maybe those things happened but they probably weren't really a big deal. But when you said what you said, I felt like you were on my side and maybe you did think some of the things that happened were wrong….” I tailed off, and T spoke up “Yes, you're right. I do think some of the things were wrong” “Oh. Um so I was thinking about that and trying to put into words something about, uh, so I see families and children who come into foster care, and they generally have similarities in the situations of the families. Like they're often struggling with money, one or both parents not working, relationship breakdown, complicated situations… and things go on at home that I think almost everyone would agree was wrong. And I was thinking I would say it's wrong for those children to be subjected to those things. But it's hard to think that maybe things - not so extreme, but still things - were going on in my family when it was not that sort of situation at all…. So I sat down to write that, but then when I started typing, I wrote that story instead.”

Doc ID: 15173, distribution: 0.9727067947387695 ; Therapy .. // I was telling you the FACTS! // a messy session  T must have read my face and my hesitation when she asked me about how brutally honest I wanted her to be, because she said “Ok, how about I ask you a question instead?” She asked me what I would have done, if I were my parents making a decision about their child moving ahead school years. I said that I might have gone with the first year but not the second year. That led into me giving a long explanation of the circumstances around me moving ahead two years and the decision-making that I think went on around it.  T asked me if there'd been talk of me taking a Gap year after sixth form before I went to university, and I said it had been mentioned but that there wasn't anything exciting that you could do at age  in a Gap year then because for most stuff you had to be  or over for their insurance policies. I wondered out loud whether my parents should have pushed more for me to take a Gap year or whether I should have had the insight to think that it might not be best for me to go to university so young, or was it reasonable for me to just follow the system. What if my parents had said no, I needed to stay at home for another year. “They could have had me at home for two more years than they did! If they'd wanted me there, they could have had me there.” It's a thought I don't think I've ever put into words out loud before. “Ohhhh… hmm… is that what this is all about?” T asked.  I was temporarily shocked by what I just said, so I said “Uh, is what what it's all about?” T said “Well, you've just spent  minutes defending your parents and their decisions, and now you're saying they could have had you at home longer.” All I heard was the first part of that. It felt like all our attunement fell away in an instant and T “dropped” me, emotionally-speaking. I don't know what T observed looking at me, but I felt a big shift happen inside me. “I don't think I was defending my parents!” I exclaimed. I pulled away, as much as you can over Skype, from our connection. T said “ok but you were explaining why they made the decisions they did…” “I was telling you the FACTS!” I fired back. T said something else, which I can't remember. I think she asked me another question. I ignored her question and said grumpily, “I'm all confused, because now it feels like we've been talking at cross-purposes all this time” I was telling T the story of moving up two academic years, which is a story I have told hundreds of times in my life, and she thinks I was defending my parents. I got overwhelmed by all the feelings suddenly swirling up in me, and T sitting in front of me trying to keep the conversation going, and I did something which I haven't done in therapy for years . I flopped over sideways off-screen and hid my face on my legs, so T couldn't see me anymore. Then I just did some breathing and tried to see my way forward out of the swirling emotions. T waited a bit and then started talking. I've no idea what she said. I peeked round eventually and I was surprised to see her still on the screen. I don't know why I was surprised.  I told myself that I don't want to use the rest of the session hiding off screen, and I don't want to have to end while we are still in this mess, so I need to sit back up and have the conversation. I did manage to sit up and be back on screen again, although I kept my legs drawn up in front of me in a defensive way. “Are you angry with me?” T asked. I glanced at her and told her “yes”. “Ok… we don't really have time to talk about it anymore today… it's time to end… so do you want to unwind for five minutes? - or do you just want to leave it there?” I paused while I had a bit of an internal battle between wanting to just walk away and wanting to have a little bit of connection so I don't have to carry this feeling with me all week. “I just want to leave it there, but I'll probably feel worse if I do.” “Ok” T said, and started making some chat about d. It was hard to push through and respond to her questions, but I did mutter a couple of answers, and T tried hard to empathise and remind me of my strengths and say some positive things. It seems very strange that I can be angry with someone, and also at the same time manage to have a normal(ish) conversation with them. Looking back, I do appreciate that even while she knew I was angry with her, T also didn't want to leave me in that place all week but tried to rebuild a bit of our connection and positive feeling in the few minutes we had left.  We ended with scheduling and then we both said “bye” and I clicked off. Usually I say thankyou as well but I wasn't feeling it this week so I didn't.

Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.9685410857200623 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 16064, distribution: 0.9681710004806519 ; Therapy .. // part  // emotional energy  T found the list I'd sent her on her phone of what I wanted to be different in my relationship with H. She asked which bit of it I wanted to talk about. I said I wasn't sure if I really felt like talking about any of it right now. T suggested we try and push through that feeling, unless I wanted to talk about a different topic.  “I think… we were looking at this list last session before the break… and I'd forgotten - completely forgotten till we came to talk of scheduling right at the end - that I wouldn't see you the next week… and then I was all in the middle of stuff on the list but suddenly I wasn't going to see you…” “Yes, it all felt a bit raw?” T asked “Yes, it was all left hanging. And I'd forgotten I wasn't going to see you last week, because I'd been too distracted about you being unexpectedly away during the week before and whether you were going to be back in time for my session. It was like I'd been looking back and I forgot to look forward…” I don't really know whether T got what it felt like for me when she unexpectedly went away. Or maybe she did get it, but she had forgotten about the little exchange we had about it. Which is maybe understandable because maybe it was a family emergency and she has been caught up in dealing with it and has understandably forgotten some of the details of what went on with my therapy before hand. I still felt like she wasn't entirely on the ball this session.  We looked again at the list and I started talking about how ideally I would like to be able to share emotional stuff with H in the moment, without feeling lazy, guilty or demanding. As it is, I either only tell him when the crisis is all resolved and everything is neatly wrapped up, or when I have a massive meltdown to the point of not being able to function.  “When I'm all emotionally stressed out, in order to be able to share it with H, I need even more emotional energy. But if I'm all maxed out, I don't have any more emotional energy to use. So I just keep it to myself.” We talked about it for a bit but I can't remember now what we said. I think we might have run out of time at that point. T lightened up the conversation for a bit of grounding before we finished. I got talking about a fostering course I am doing and we ended up going about  minutes over time, but only on chitchat not therapy (maybe that's not so bad?)

Doc ID: 17079, distribution: 0.9679985642433167 ; faithhopeloveandtherapy:  Therapy ..// Fitbit  I asked T in therapy today if she owned a Fitbit and she said yes. She asked me if I owned one and I said no, but if it was ok for her to own one then it should be ok for me to have one too. I said I'd thought I'd seen her wearing it a couple of weeks ago and that's why I'd asked. We had a discussion about what she used it for. She explained her motivations for wearing one. I told her it felt like she was just trying to cover up what she really used it for. She told me I was assuming that her thoughts worked the same way as my thoughts. I know she does always try and be her genuine authentic self with me so part of me wants to completely believe her, but another part of me thinks she was thinking Oh shit! Rumbled! Better put a good spin on this.  I have therapy tomorrow and I'm trying to get my brain back into therapy mode after a week off (so two weeks since my last session). I only wrote about the first half of my last session. This Fitbit discussion took a good  minutes. The second half of the session we spoke about my mum some more. T pointed out the discrepancy between wanting to believe my mum was perfect yet also choosing to do things differently with my own children. It's a very good point that I can't argue with. I am trying to use it as a basis for restructuring my view of things.

Doc ID: 15958, distribution: 0.9643494486808777 ; Therapy .. // therapy but not therapy  This session was not really a therapy session. I'd texted T beforehand and asked if we could just do half a session. Mostly because of the cost - I knew I wasn't in a headspace to do therapy but I did want to see T, so paying for  minutes seemed a reasonable way to do that. We used WhatsApp video rather than Skype, because H was using the laptop for work. I said I didn't want to do any actual therapy so we mostly debriefed about the coronavirus and how it is affecting us. T talked a bit about her faith (which I share), and she said she was being much more bold in what she put out on Facebook. I thought that was interesting because while we have some mutual Facebook friends, obviously I am not allowed to be her Facebook friend so I am never quite sure how much she uses it.  T asked me what I wanted to do with therapy during this time. “Do you want to have a break from regular sessions and just contact me as and when you want a session? Or do you want to keep a regular time?” I said that I would like to keep a regular time for now but that it was hard to know with the way everything was changing, I didn't know how I would feel. I asked her if she was still seeing her other clients. She paused and I could kind of see her thinking about how much to tell me, then she said she was only seeing one other at the moment, over Skype. The rest were either finishing or taking a break, and she wasn't getting any new clients at this time. I know she doesn't see that many clients in a week anyway. I have a strong attachment to T and the thought of not seeing her each week stirs up abandonment feelings. Just being with her is soothing to me and knowing that she is there between sessions, I can hold onto our connection ok but I still want to check in each week.  Towards the end of the  minutes, T said that she had heard a really beautiful worship song in the last week that she felt really comforted her in the current situation, and she offered to send it to me. A few weeks ago, I asked her to send me a song for my half marathon training playlist, which she did, so I wonder if that's what gave her the idea of giving me another song . I like having songs from her, it's another connection between us. Like a transition object without the actual object. I said yes please send me the song. T told me it's based on the blessing from the book of Numbers “The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.” I like to think of her speaking those words over me. It was a nice end to the session. We agreed to meet again next week and just take it one week at a time.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9636786580085754 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 17232, distribution: 0.9619752764701843 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me “Do you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?”. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be “No”, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do.
