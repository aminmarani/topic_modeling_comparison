i am greater than the narrative my anxiety is creating in my head.

i matter, and i deserve to live a life of peace, joy, fulfillment, and love. i will let go of and separate myself from the things getting in the way of the life i deserve.

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
‚Äî‚Äî
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

fabulous on top of salads, as a side to my sandwiches, or as a snack dipped in chipotle mayo, you can now find these mixed root veggie fries and the @strongrootsusa cauliflower hash browns in the freezer section of @walmart stores nationwide! #ad

- complete a bachelor's (or master's degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January , , a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an ‚ÄúInternship.‚Äù some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete  hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration's registration exam
- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. / of the United States require licensure to practice. 
- maintain continuing education -  hours every  years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the ‚Äúnutritionist‚Äù title isn't regulated so there's no guarantee of the experience and education that they've had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients ‚Äîand to the world. good (i say this because i can't blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

Most of us have mastered certain poses that allow us to literally transform our bodies within seconds... Myself included.

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.8938066761386023 ; REALITY CHECK‚ùóÔ∏èThis is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years‚Ä¶ 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a ‚Äúhealthy & fit‚Äù body would automatically be ‚Äúflawless‚Äù & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either‚Ä¶ ü´¢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places‚Ä¶ Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
üçë still have a small bootay
‚ö°Ô∏èhave cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
ü§∞üèª still have a lower belly bump
üí™ not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
üòÆ‚Äçüí® not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
üçïbe flexible with eating
üí§ rest
üï∫üèºhave a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's ‚Äúideal body‚Äù, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! üòç | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

üåü Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
üåü Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
üåü LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world ü•π I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same‚Ä¶ Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
üåü Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
üåü Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you‚Ä¶ 
üåü If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key ü•∞
üåü At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us üíÖ It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible ü´∂

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks üíó

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It's from their new Eclipse collection & I've been living in it üòç [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it üëèüèª

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! ü•≥

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know üíõ

Happy Real Me Monday ü¶ã have the best week xo

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.8497105865133867 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of ‚Äúoh, they're human!‚Äù or ‚Äúyay, she looks like me!‚Äù And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw üå∏

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday üåª 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same üíñ

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.8491104691954328 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those ‚Äúless flattering‚Äù angles.

So often people joke about ‚Äúgirls on Instagram VS girls in real life‚Äù or catfishing in general‚Ä¶ These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look ‚Äúflattering‚Äù & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat üôÑ

The thing is, you don't have to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù all the time‚Ä¶ ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life‚Ä¶ Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone ‚Äúperfect‚Äù & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own‚Ä¶ Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark ‚Äî it's coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio üòç

- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

line a brownie pan with parchment paper and set aside. mix the nut butter and syrup together until smooth. add the protein powder and mixed until well-combined (may have to use your hands here until a dough forms). mix in chopped chocolate. transfer dough to the pan and flatten out to desired thickness. freeze for about an hour or until firm. enjoy straight from the freezer or slightly thawed for best flavor!

Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.819759433916754 ; Talking about (shhhü§´) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about‚Ä¶ that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said ‚Äúoh I was thinking‚Ä¶ at the end of last year‚Ä¶‚Äù then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly ‚ÄúBut now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶. okayyyy‚Äù in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added ‚ÄúMaybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about‚Äù. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 17079, distribution: 0.8163605132607278 ; faithhopeloveandtherapy:  Therapy ..// Fitbit  I asked T in therapy today if she owned a Fitbit and she said yes. She asked me if I owned one and I said no, but if it was ok for her to own one then it should be ok for me to have one too. I said I'd thought I'd seen her wearing it a couple of weeks ago and that's why I'd asked. We had a discussion about what she used it for. She explained her motivations for wearing one. I told her it felt like she was just trying to cover up what she really used it for. She told me I was assuming that her thoughts worked the same way as my thoughts. I know she does always try and be her genuine authentic self with me so part of me wants to completely believe her, but another part of me thinks she was thinking Oh shit! Rumbled! Better put a good spin on this.  I have therapy tomorrow and I'm trying to get my brain back into therapy mode after a week off (so two weeks since my last session). I only wrote about the first half of my last session. This Fitbit discussion took a good  minutes. The second half of the session we spoke about my mum some more. T pointed out the discrepancy between wanting to believe my mum was perfect yet also choosing to do things differently with my own children. It's a very good point that I can't argue with. I am trying to use it as a basis for restructuring my view of things.
