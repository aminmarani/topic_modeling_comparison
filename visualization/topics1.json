This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.\n\n\ud83e\udd79Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfa8Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner <span class=\"lighter\">world</span> and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.\n\n\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd0eAbility to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! \n\n\ud83d\ude3bAppreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.\n\n\u2696\ufe0fStrong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the <span class=\"lighter\">world</span>.\n\n\ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\udcadDeep <span class=\"lighter\">self</span>-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and <span class=\"lighter\">self</span>-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.\n\nbeing a highly sensitive <span class=\"boldest\">person</span> can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make

randomly in <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. I find this often. I have some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about, sometimes it needs several <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s, some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s on time. \u201cNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing.\u201d After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing in <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of that \u201c<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> Faith, time is up\u201d, I too will just carry on.  This <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> I reminded T of what she'd said and I <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> her if I do that, not finishing on time. \u201cNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -\u201c I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>s me the length of time we've been connected. \u201cOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> is a relationship and you can have a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.\u201d I said \u201cUh <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>\u2026 I mean, I will just keep <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of a <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> until you <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>, I know I just keep going.\u201d T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. \u201cBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.\u201d I <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> for a moment and said \u201cSo\u2026uh\u2026 that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I could do to find other <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s, and I did no<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> so in the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> I carried on seeing you.\u201d \u201cOkayyyy\u2026. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?\u201d T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span>. Omg no\u2026 slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. \u201cNo! I'm just <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>ing you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.\u201d \u201cWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the <span class=\"bold\">last</span> three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>.\u201d I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. I need T in my life. We haven't really <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about what contact between us, if any, will lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> like after <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> is <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed.

Of course it's been referred to in the context of my responses to other <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s do when they figure out the theory of what's going on with their clients.

I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> with me, and she has been working with this one for  <span class=\"boldest\">years</span> now.

That sort of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>.

Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don't know what your <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s rules on texting are so I can't know how she'd respond if you texted her. Also if it's an issue that you know you don't see eye to eye on, then it's really best discussed in a <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> rather than by text, so you don't <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you've been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>? That way it puts it on the ag<span class=\"bolder\">end</span>a but keeps the conversation for the <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> room.

We aren't <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about the practical details of imminent termination but I think T is working on a drip drip approach with the topic.

There won't be that reassurance then. T said that <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> we can continue to do three monthly check-ins after we've officially <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed.

We <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you\u2026. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> with your emotions\u2026. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?\u201d I think for a <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>, T <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>s quite a lot. I have used and abused it a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> over the <span class=\"boldest\">years</span>. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>s too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said \u201cEr, no.\u201d T smiled. \u201cOk, well that's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, it's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for us both to see <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s from different angles.\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026 I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.\u201d T waited. \u201cGo on! take the plunge\u201d, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ed at the first of two screenshots from bo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>s about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about me and H, and then T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> me how I would like our relationship to lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like she'd forgotten what we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about. Up to then I <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like we knew where we were going and then that <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week before the break, it was quite a difficult <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, \u201cYes <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, so <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -\u201c  (don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is)  \u201c- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for us to \u201cmiss\u201d each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for you to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me if you think I'm losing track, that's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, that's your responsibility to do that.\u201d  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said \u201cUh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> before the break, we <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about me and H, and it was quite difficult\u2026. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.\u201d", "https://faithhopeloveandtherapy.tumblr.com/post/612781779540164608/therapy-100320-how-did-we-get-here", "https://64.media.tumblr.com/c46cbc67dcc86dca28b63a4c3ef070cf/5f6ace133ce2e5e5-e6/s540x810/14c8c20426fc9a9a58e017976176c92dc30f2ca0.jpg"], ["therapy_session_talk_therapist_bit_talking_ok_maybe_felt_last_thing_asked_thought_end_hard_trying_brain_tell_told_years", "Question: Do your daughters like the foster babies?

Here's my fav RMM <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> from across the year to remind you that <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> are ever-changing & to never compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to what you see <span class=\"boldest\">online</span> or in the media. \n\nNot only does your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> day-to-day & year-to-year, but also with different lighting, poses, angles or clothing, so it's hardly fair to base your worth or judge your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> on something as fickle & ever-changing as your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>.\n\nLet me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> every day, this is what it's doing for you:\n\n\u2764\ufe0f your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?\n\ud83e\udd59 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc \n\ud83e\udda0 half of our <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your <span class=\"boldest\">size</span> in order to fit a <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standard that isn't <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic? \ud83e\udd7a\n\ud83e\uddec while you scroll through IG & compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers, your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .\u201d, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as <span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span> as possible \ud83e\udd2f\n\nDon't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is!!!! It's your home. Sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way \ud83d\udc9b \n\nI think  is the year you no longer hold your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> back! Wear the shorts, enjoy the food, move your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> bc you can \u2014 not bc you have to, be gentle with your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & remember that your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is the least interesting thing about you!!
