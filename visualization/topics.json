      "someone else's reality is never going to be the exact same as your own.\n——\none of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, <span class=\"bolder\">live</span>s, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and <span class=\"boldest\">person</span>al experiences.\n——\nthat being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a <span class=\"bold\">lot</span> more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.\n——\nwe are all just imperfect humans doing our <span class=\"bold\">best</span> to make it...so in a <span class=\"lighter\">world</span> where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?",

      "Share this with / tag a fellow 🧚🏼‍♀️Sensitive Soul!!🧚🏼‍♀️\n\nBeing a highly sensitive <span class=\"boldest\">person</span> (HSP) doesn't have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨\n\ni used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!\n\nSome (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:\n\n🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.\n\n🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.\n\n👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner <span class=\"lighter\">world</span> and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.\n\n👀🔎Ability to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! \n\n😻Appreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.\n\n⚖️Strong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the <span class=\"lighter\">world</span>.\n\n😌💭Deep <span class=\"lighter\">self</span>-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and <span class=\"lighter\">self</span>-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.\n\nbeing a highly sensitive <span class=\"boldest\">person</span> can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make their “sensitivity” their STRENGTH 💪🏽 in living their most aligned life. \n\nif youve ever felt a pull to <span class=\"lighter\">work</span> with me, my next spaces for coaching open up in April! so even if you aren't ready now, apply to save a spot ❤️✨\n\n🔗in my bio for my Flourish with Purpose program application OR you can DM me “PURPOSE” if you're unsure if this is for you!",

      "How to transform negative thoughts:\n\nWhen they come up, ask your<span class=\"lighter\">self</span>:\n-do i believe this thought?\n-is it mine or someone else's?\n-is it true? who can affirm it?\n-can it hurt me or someone else?\n-where is it coming from?\n-what is it trying to tell me?\n-what can I learn from it?\n-am I ready to heal/release this belief? Why?\n\nI'm not saying that negative thoughts are bad and you should never have them, nor am I calling them good. They're actually..... just thoughts. And when we investigate the <span class=\"lighter\">feeling</span>s we have with it, we give ourselves the power to transform the thoughts into something <span class=\"boldest\">health</span>y or something hurtful. It's all about introspection and perspective ❤️😌🙏🏽 photo/art by @jazminmargaret",

      "Therapy .. // <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ings  Things come up very randomly in <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. I find this often. I have some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about, sometimes it needs several <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s, some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing in <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of that “<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> I reminded T of what she'd said and I <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>s me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> is a relationship and you can have a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>… I mean, I will just keep <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of a <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> until you <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I could do to find other <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s, and I did no<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> so in the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span>. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>ing you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the <span class=\"bold\">last</span> three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. I need T in my life. We haven't really <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about what contact between us, if any, will lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> like after <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> is <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.",

She replied “yes, it is you… but you're learning that your feelings are valid now” I first came across the quote as I was lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ing some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> else up in the bo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, and it really reminded me of how <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ing calm on the outside. That is definitely a <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It's strange to think it's not normal actually. Doesn't everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone's <span class=\"boldest\">brain</span> works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else's. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that's probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I've never really sp<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>en about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was “quite avoidant” when it came up in conversation over some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>, but that's about it. Of course it's been referred to in the context of my responses to other <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s do when they figure out the theory of what's going on with their clients. I think it's perhaps some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> more next <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>,",

      "Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I s<span class=\"bolder\">end</span> her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> weird, it was weird to find myself in a bo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a bo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> how it had <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about the attachment stuff. That's when I <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> that we were probably a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> left and she laughed and said “<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>. She <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> me to s<span class=\"bolder\">end</span> her the other two screenshots for next week and we would lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> at them then.

      "Therapy .. // <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>  Ever since that one <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> where T tried to bring the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>.  Towards the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> grounded before we <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>.” We came to an <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of what we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about, and T tried to bring <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s back to the surface. She said “So <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me about [some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>].” I can't even remember what she <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>s the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> now before the two week Christmas break.",

      "Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> you some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>? Can I s<span class=\"bolder\">end</span> you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> from her. When she nodded, I <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> “Uh… what do you <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my <span class=\"bold\">last</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> and she said she would <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> her supervisor how well I was doing. T <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>s me about the sorts of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s she <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>s about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> work - “that can happen to <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span>. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that <span class=\"bold\">last</span> exchange, but I definitely remember her <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>ing me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> with me, and she has been working with this one for  <span class=\"boldest\">years</span> now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of this <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> of conversation was when T said that she knew she could <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about these <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>. T once said early in on <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ed and shut them down very easily.",

      "Therapy .. // rupture time again  My <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span> and I had a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> of a rupture <span class=\"bold\">last</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>. We got to the <span class=\"bold\">last</span> ten minutes of the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> and I could <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> she was <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to do a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> of a repair and <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about” and I know she was <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about, I could <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about it <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>lessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span>. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span>fully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there.

I said that one of the <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span>est <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one.

      "Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>   As we were coming to the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of my <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> yesterday, we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about what we might work on this year and T said that <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> we need to think about how we will eventually <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of a <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> up having a rupture and then no time in <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> so she keeps her stuff for the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>. As it happened, I had been thinking about <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing at some point in the future at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of <span class=\"bold\">last</span> year. I'd been thinking that <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of , the biggest part of <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> of <span class=\"bold\">last</span> year…” then I got overwhelmed and br<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>e off and did that awkward sort of smile while lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ing down, that I do when I'm <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to say some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> but it's <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span>. T prompted me a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> this year would be the year I <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> we need to sp<span class=\"bolder\">end</span> a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> more time thinking about”. I started to say some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I br<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>e off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.",

      "Therapy //  I <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> T I had some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s” but I <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> that was a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.",

She <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> me if I owned one and I said no, but if it was <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for her to own one then it should be <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for me to have one too. I said I'd <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> I'd seen her wearing it a couple of weeks ago and that's why I'd <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span>. We had a discussion about what she used it for. She explained her motivations for wearing one. I <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> her it <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like she was just <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to cover up what she really used it for. She <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> me I was assuming that her <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span>s worked the same way as my <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span>s. I know she does always try and be her genuine authentic self with me so part of me wants to completely believe her, but another part of me thinks she was thinking Oh shit! Rumbled! Better put a good spin on this.  I have <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> tomorrow and I'm <span class=\"boldest\">trying</span> to get my <span class=\"boldest\">brain</span> back into <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> mode after a week off (so two weeks since my <span class=\"bold\">last</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>).

      "Question: Hiya, I was interested in your advice- I have a <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span> that I really like, but we just don't see eye to eye on one particular issue. I've been feeling this way for ages but I'm too scared to bring it up in <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>. Now I'm not seeing her this week and naturally this problem is all I can think about. The worst part of me just wants to give up and run away and just ghost her but I feel like I should face the problem head on?? Would it be bad to text her about it now? Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don't know what your <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s rules on texting are so I can't know how she'd respond if you texted her. Also if it's an issue that you know you don't see eye to eye on, then it's really best discussed in a <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> rather than by text, so you don't <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you've been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>? That way it puts it on the ag<span class=\"bolder\">end</span>a but keeps the conversation for the <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> room. The fact that you're thinking about it a lot this week probably means it's an important topic for you to discuss. You could even <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> around it in <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> for a while, saying you have some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about but you're worried, you know don't see eye to eye about it, you're really scared to bring it up, it makes you just want to run away and not come to <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> anymore. That helps your <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span> understand what an important <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> it is for you.When I've approached stuff that way with my T, she reminds me that we've <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> stuff before, that she hasn't got upset about certain topics, that she has been really happy that I've <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> safe enough to bring these <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s up, proud that I've been brave enough to say them etc etc. That helps me build up the courage to bring up the difficult <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>.Hope that helps anon x",

      "Therapy .. // <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ings  T brought the conversation back round to <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ings, as she had made a note in her diary previously for us to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about it this week. We aren't <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about the practical details of imminent termination but I think T is working on a drip drip approach with the topic. She said she is going to bring it up once a month. I am finding that I am gradually managing to stay more present in conversations about <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>. Previously I would shut down completely at the mention of it, then there was a <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> just into the start of lockdown when T said she was now planning to retire in the next couple of <span class=\"boldest\">years</span>, and I <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> myself going to that shutdown place and I fought against it and managed to stay mostly present. Since then we've <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about it twice more I think. My window of tolerance for staying with the topic is enlarging gradually. T always reminds me that she is not leaving yet, and that we will have a steady phase out of <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>s over many months, not just a sudden <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> date. (Of course this is dep<span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ent on no<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> unexpected occurring in her life or mine that forces us to stop <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> early. I am a little <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> scared of that happening. It's one of the few positives to <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ing <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> that I can see, being in control of the <span class=\"bolder\">end</span> rather than having it suddenly pushed on us.) She <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> me how the two week break had gone. I lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ed down and fidgeted a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> and then said “It was like part of me is like the baby when I go out of the room, she cries because she thinks I've gone forever. And then another part of me is like me in the other room, calling back through to the baby that I'm still here… So there's part of me that's wailing and crying and feeling abandoned because you're not here, and then there's another part that's saying it's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, T is coming back, she hasn't disappeared, she hasn't left you…” T waited a moment to check I'd finished speaking, and then she said “That's really good, Faith! It shows you're learning to parent yourself now. That was some<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> you couldn't do before.” I responded that it was one <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to do it now, when I knew she was coming back, but what will I do after we have <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span>? There won't be that reassurance then. T said that <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span> we can continue to do three monthly check-ins after we've officially <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed. I don't know if she was saying that off the top of her head, I hope she has <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> it through if so, because it feels a big <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> to me. I would love to keep the connection and be able to check in every so often. I can see a parallel here with the way we say goodbye to our foster babies, and it makes me sad - but I'll keep that for another post.",

      "I had <span class=\"lighter\">therapy</span> this morning and it <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like a very bland <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>. It didn't feel worth the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> fee (although of course I will still pay it). The <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed and I wondered what we actually achieved. Last week we <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about my childhood, and as we <span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ed, T said “we probably need to sp<span class=\"bolder\">end</span> a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> more time thinking about this”. So I was all willing to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about it some more this week but it's <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> to open it all up again and it feels like we never got back as deep as we were the first time.  I think I wanted her to respond in certain ways to <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I said, and when she didn't, I <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> dissatisfied and frustrated. I kept working <span class=\"bolder\">hard</span> but it just wasn't really happening in my <span class=\"boldest\">brain</span> this week. I couldn't find the words to explain <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span>s or feelings, I couldn't gather my <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span>s enough to get them into words I wanted to say. I tried to go with what was coming up in my <span class=\"boldest\">brain</span>, which meant we jumped around a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span>. I think it did work to an extent because I did eventually stop thinking about how we weren't connecting and how we weren't really getting into any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> properly…. and I suppose when you stop thinking about it that's often because it's started happening. Ahh anyway. I will try and think of some positives of the <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> in a minute.",

      "Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> T that I <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> I needed to carry on <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about it. “This week's been a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> difficult…. because <span class=\"bold\">last</span> <span class=\"lighter\">session</span>, I had <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I wanted to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about… uh, <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s I'd been holding all week… and then I didn't get chance to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about them because we went off <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about what you wanted to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about.” I actually <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> that T was going to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me that it was my <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> and I can choose to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about what I want, and I was all set to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span>ing them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> post and then I hadn't had chance to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> insensitive, and she was sorry. T <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a t<span class=\"bolder\">end</span>ency to idealise our <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got any<span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> wrong then I would think it was never <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span> cop out!! It's good to not get <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s wrong but it's also good to get <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span> is always right??",

      "Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my <span class=\"boldest\">brain</span> and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about the first two <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s on it and never got on to the <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> that connected….” “Ah <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, and how many <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s do you have on your list today?” I laughed and sho<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> my head and <span class=\"boldest\">told</span> her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span> about the <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> you didn't get on to <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about… and it kind of came from stuff we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about <span class=\"bold\">maybe</span>  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ed confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She <span class=\"bolder\">thought</span> a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about regulation. We <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span> with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>, T <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>s quite a lot. I have used and abused it a <span class=\"lighter\">bit</span> over the <span class=\"boldest\">years</span>. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>s too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, it's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for us both to see <span class=\"bolder\">thing</span>s from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>ed at the first of two screenshots from bo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span>s about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about me and H, and then T <span class=\"bolder\">asked</span> me how I would like our relationship to lo<span class=\"bold\">ok</span> like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like she'd forgotten what we were <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ing about. Up to then I <span class=\"bold\">felt</span> like we knew where we were going and then that <span class=\"bold\">last</span> week before the break, it was quite a difficult <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, so <span class=\"lighter\">therapist</span>s are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is don't <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span> for you to <span class=\"boldest\">tell</span> me if you think I'm losing track, that's <span class=\"bold\">ok</span>, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that <span class=\"lighter\">session</span> before the break, we <span class=\"lighter\">talk</span>ed about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”",

But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>, like women are today. \n\nToday, the <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> can't possibly <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> as they do. The standard of <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span>'s very best photo, they're the highlight of <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else's life, and when we consume those <span class=\"bold\">image</span>s every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span>, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span> colour, hair colour, height or <span class=\"boldest\">size</span> is not it. \n\nSo, what is <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> to you?\n\nTo me, <span class=\"bold\">happy</span> is <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>. \nHealthy is <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>. \nReal is <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>.\nYOU are <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>.\n\nWearing @baseline's new Seamless collection 😍 absolutely adore these pieces & the gorgeous ribbed fabric!!

      "Happy Real Me Monday my friends... But with ✨ a special lil twist ✨ \n\nTo celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 \n\nAs humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: \n\n🌸 people can <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> the way their <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> in <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else posts <span class=\"boldest\">online</span> is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸\n\nLet me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> every day, this is what it's doing for you:\n\n❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?\n🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 \n🦠 half of our <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your <span class=\"boldest\">size</span> in order to fit a <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standard that isn't <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic? 🥺\n🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers, your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs.

      "Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>, loose <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span>, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those “less flattering” angles.\n\nSo often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in <span class=\"lighter\">real</span> life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>ing better <span class=\"boldest\">online</span> than they do in <span class=\"lighter\">real</span> life because they post <span class=\"bold\">image</span>s they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> posed perfectly to <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> fat 🙄\n\nThe thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!\n\nI, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in <span class=\"lighter\">real</span> life… Whereas now, I <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s. No<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is judging you as much as you judge your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span> is pretty much a superpower!\n\nDon't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> & determine your happiness/confidence.\n\nI post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers on IG, that the <span class=\"lighter\">real</span> you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & usually feel alone on.\n\nHappy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green active<span class=\"bolder\">wear</span> set is unreleased @gymshark — it's coming sooon!!

      "✨ When you <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> the way you <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> at things, the things you <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> at <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> ✨\n\nTrust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 \n\nWhen you start being kinder to your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span> allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>ing at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>) differently…\n \nYou might <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ise that the standard of <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> you've followed since you were young is not all that <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers on the internet, you might find that their <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>, but most of the time they <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.\n\nFor e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing my<span class=\"bold\">self</span> through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> had brainwashed me with, I can see the <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> in both. Both are <span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span>, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.\n\nI know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & see what happens 💫 \n\n#<span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span>standards #feelgood #positivemind #thisisnormal #instagramvs<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ity #expectationvs<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ity #imperfectionis<span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> #<span class=\"bold\">self</span>confidence #nevermissa<span class=\"bold\">monday</span> #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span>neutral #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span>neutrality #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span>acceptance #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span><span class=\"bold\">image</span>healing",

      "REALITY CHECK❗️This is a <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… \n\nThe left <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> are an example of what I personally used to expect a <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> with a “<span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span> & fit” <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢\n\nWe collectively have this expectation that confident, <span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span> & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span>, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?\n\nBut the truth is, you can be confident, <span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span> & fit and:\n🍑 still have a small bootay\n⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works\n🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump\n💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle\n😮‍💨 not force your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to workout in ways you dread\n🍕be flexible with eating\n💤 rest\n🕺🏼have a <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> like the one on the right <\n\nYou can also be <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else's “ideal <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>”, but still experience low <span class=\"bold\">self</span>-esteem & negative <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> <span class=\"bold\">image</span> your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>.\n\nHealth & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span>, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s different on everyone, it isn't a one-<span class=\"boldest\">size</span>-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see <span class=\"boldest\">online</span> & strive to <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> like don't always <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span> (like me), and they get <span class=\"bold\">self</span>-conscious too. \n\nSo I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those un<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic standards you've set your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL <span class=\"bold\">self</span>!

      "Neither of these <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> reflect the way that I see my<span class=\"bold\">self</span> or my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>, and yet ALL are me 🤷🏻‍♀️👇\n\nHow is it that in one photo I can have ab lines, yet a couple seconds later in the next I have a soft belly with rolls & folds?\n\nHow is it that in one photo I can have thick, luscious locks, yet in the next my hair is thinning with broken pieces all around my face?\n\nBecause as humans, our <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> move & <span class=\"boldest\">change</span>. We'll <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> different from time-to-time, photo-to-photo, angle-to-angle & pose-to-pose. AND, your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> & appearance isn't always as you perceive it either.\n\nThat's exactly why you can't give your appearance so much power over your happiness, because it's forever changing. \n\nI put a poll up today on my stories & more than % of you said that you view your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> as a “before” picture & that you believe there's an “after” <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> that will make you happier.\n\nWe are all our own harshest critics. But no<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> (other than you) is <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>ing over you with a microscope, no<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> cares, everyone's too worried about themselves to worry about your big feet or broad shoulders or cellulite. \n\nThere's no physical “after” or transformation that will cure your negative <span class=\"bold\">self</span>-talk. No matter how <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span> or “perfect” you think <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> is, there will be things they don't love about themselves too. No<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is immune. Once we <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ise we're all in the same boat, the sooner we might stop giving so much power to the way that we <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> & start being kinder to ourselves instead. After all, no amount of <span class=\"bold\">self</span>-improvement can make up for any lack of <span class=\"bold\">self</span>-acceptance 💗\n\n#igvs<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ity #<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>post #embraceyour<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> #embraceyour<span class=\"bold\">self</span> #confidenceiskey #<span class=\"bold\">self</span>esteem #womenempowerment #femaleempowerment #bekindtoyourmind #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span>acceptance",

Here's my fav RMM <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> from across the year to remind you that <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> are ever-changing & to never compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to what you see <span class=\"boldest\">online</span> or in the media. \n\nNot only does your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> day-to-day & year-to-year, but also with different lighting, poses, angles or clothing, so it's hardly fair to base your worth or judge your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> on something as fickle & ever-changing as your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>.\n\nLet me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> every day, this is what it's doing for you:\n\n❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?\n🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 \n🦠 half of our <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your <span class=\"boldest\">size</span> in order to fit a <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standard that isn't <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic? 🥺\n🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to strangers, your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as <span class=\"boldest\">healthy</span> as possible 🤯\n\nDon't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is!!!! It's your home. Sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 \n\nI think  is the year you no longer hold your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> back! Wear the shorts, enjoy the food, move your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> bc you can — not bc you have to, be gentle with your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & remember that your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> is the least interesting thing about you!!

      "Welcome to the th instalment of #RealMeMonday 😂👏🏻 which one is your fav?\n \nI hope this series of 'what IG sees VS what IG doesn't' <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> reminds you why you shouldn't compare your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to people <span class=\"boldest\">online</span>! It's not fair on us to compare our natural, normal, everyday selves to the perfected, posed & edited versions of people <span class=\"boldest\">online</span>... We only see % of <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span>'s life here on IG, so it's unfair to compare our % to <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else's highlighted % 🤯\n\nWhen I first started this series I still worried that <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> might see these <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> of me and think, “Oh, she's not as pretty as I thought” but then I <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ised it LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER! That doesn't <span class=\"boldest\">change</span> or determine who I am, what path I'm on and how I make others feel — unless I let it. Being more accepting of your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> is a choice, CHOOSE to be kinder to your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>! 🤪 Anyway... All I hope for is that my Instagram can be a home for you to find comfort, confidence, acceptance, motivation & positivity.

Why do we do this to ourselves?\n \nWe're not supposed to be perfect (whatever “perfect” is).\n\nPlus, everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to criticise you! 🙈 \n\nSo… This week I challenge you to fuel your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> & still <span class=\"bolder\">wear</span> that cute dress or those shorts or whatever outfit it is that you've been too afraid to <span class=\"bolder\">wear</span> — and just ROCK IT!! 🥳 \n\nThis weekly series is here to remind you not to compare your life or your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> to <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that.\n\nHappy Real Me Monday! ☀️ Swipe to the th slide for some super candid pics from my camera roll! 😂 Which number are you today? I'm a bit of  & a bit of  HAHA!

      "REAL VS EDITED... 😅 Swipe to see just how EASY it is to <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>hop our <span class=\"bold\">bodies</span> these days... No wonder everyone on Instagram <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s so dang 'perfect'! 🥴\n\nThe standard of <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> on social media is forever changing... It's un<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic and unobtainable — but you will always be YOU... So let's start appreciating that. Your waist doesn't have to be paper thin, your bum is fine the way it is, cellulite and all... So next time, when you consider editing a photo or comparing your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else, DON'T DO IT! You are more than enough, just the way you are ✨",

      "One day I had to sit down with my<span class=\"bold\">self</span> & decide that I would love my<span class=\"bold\">self</span>, no matter what my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s like 🤝\n\nDid you know that Dylan takes all of my 'Real Me Monday' <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>? But would you also believe there was a solid FIVE years at the start of our relationship where I wouldn't let him see my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> at all? \n\nAt the time, it was so deeply engrained in me that I wasn't worthy of being seen or loved the way I was. I didn't want him to see that my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> was soft instead of firm, that my legs were covered in cellulite, the way the loose <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span> on my tummy sagged when I bent over slightly or that my tummy was bigger than my chest.\n\nThe issue was never him, or anyone else, it was my own <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> <span class=\"bold\">image</span> & all of the messages I'd taken as “fact” over the years about what was acceptable & what wasn't. \n\nDylan's always told me he loves me exactly the way I am, that he'll love me just as much when I'm wrinkly all over. But it doesn't matter how many people tell you you are something, because YOU have to believe it for it to have any merit.\n\nNo<span class=\"lighter\">body</span> else sees you the way YOU see you. The people who <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ly love you will only see your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> as the <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>, ever-changing flesh sack that homes your soul.\n\nIt saddens me to think that for  years of my life, whether I was at my largest or smallest, I <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ly believed that the <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>, unposed, relaxed, soft version of my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> (in the above <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>, on the right) were any different or less loveable than the posed, “perfected”, sucked-in version of my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> (on the left).\n\nRemembering this time in my life is heartbreaking, but it's also a <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span> reminder… \n🪞 You are so much more than your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> or the way that you <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>. \n🏡 It is possible to create a better relationship with your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> so that you feel comfortable in your <span class=\"lighter\">skin</span>.\n💗 You are not loved for your <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s, you are loved for your heart.\n👋 It's okay to let go of the <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> / <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> expectations we grow up around.\n💌 Embracing your true <span class=\"bold\">self</span> & being authentically you will inspire so many others around you without you even knowing it.\n🫂 You (& your <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>) are already worthy of being seen & respected.\n\n#expectationvs<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ity #<span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span>standards #girl #relatable #instagramvs<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ity #<span class=\"lighter\">body</span><span class=\"bold\">image</span> ad",

      "You will never ✨actually✨ see your own <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>. You may <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s in <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> who <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>s like them. \n\nYou will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>.\n\nIt's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these un<span class=\"lighter\">real</span>istic expectations, comparing your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> to others or the social media version of your<span class=\"bold\">self</span>, and constantly searching for the things you wish to <span class=\"boldest\">change</span>.\n\nAND… You never see your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> when you're just being you.  \nYou never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,\nOr when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,\nOr the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,\nOr the smiles you infect others with,\nOr how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,\nOr the way your voice can make <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> feel better instantly,\nOr the way you can empower <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.\n\nYou are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on your<span class=\"bold\">self</span> ❤️‍🔥\n\nIt's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> at my<span class=\"bold\">self</span> under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> to <span class=\"lighter\">look</span> like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see my<span class=\"bold\">self</span> for all the goodness inside of me & that is <span class=\"lighter\">real</span>ly <span class=\"bolder\">beautiful</span>. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹\n\nHope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week.

      "Happy ✨ INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY ✨ & <span class=\"lighter\">real</span> me Monday, where for the last  weeks in a row I've attempted to make Mondays a lil more enjoyable by sharing some “Insta-worthy” <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> beside the REAL version of my<span class=\"bold\">self</span>, the version I now prefer to share <span class=\"boldest\">online</span>! 🤗\n\nI used to post only my very best <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span>, and there's nothing wrong with posting <span class=\"lighter\">photos</span> you feel good in. But there was something wrong with the way I didn't feel good unless I <span class=\"lighter\">look</span>ed 'perfect'. There was something wrong with the way that I wanted to impress other people to the detriment of my mental & physical health. There was something wrong with the way that I couldn't accept my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span>, the bloating, the rolls, the bulges, my cellulite, the way my <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> slouched & relaxed when I was completely comfortable. \n\nHonestly, <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standards have <span class=\"boldest\">change</span>d SO much over the years. They're always changing, and we're always trying to shrink ourselves to fit them. So let's create our own <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> standards & make them as diverse as possible 🥰\n\nBeauty, to me, is a smile — because it has the power to make another person smile, and their smile can make <span class=\"bolder\">someone</span> else smile, and so on until YOUR smile has created a hundred more without you even knowing your impact. Beauty is kindness. It is not a shape, height, style, race, weight, hair type, <span class=\"lighter\">body</span> type, or external physical trait. It's a mentality, it's subjective, it's something that comes from within, and... it also ISN'T EVERYTHING!\n\nWhat is <span class=\"bolder\">beauty</span> to you? Lmk in the <span class=\"bolder\">comments</span> 🤔\n\nHappy international women's day!

      "My sister and her husband and my two <span class=\"boldest\">little</span> nephews are coming to stay this weekend. My nephews are  and  and adore their cousins, but they haven't ever been to our <span class=\"bolder\">house</span> before as usually we go up to their <span class=\"bolder\">house</span> (it being about  times the size of ours!) I have a rough plan for the weekend and for the meals so feeling like that's organised. My sister and <span class=\"boldest\">family</span> can have our <span class=\"bold\">bed</span>room, which has plenty of floor space for the nephews too. Then H and I will <span class=\"bolder\">sleep</span> in d's double <span class=\"bold\">bed</span>. d will <span class=\"bolder\">sleep</span> in d's pull out <span class=\"bold\">bed</span>, and d will just <span class=\"bolder\">sleep</span> in her own <span class=\"bold\">bed</span>. The <span class=\"boldest\">baby</span> room is still free but there's no space for anyone to <span class=\"bolder\">sleep</span> in there unless they don't mind hopping in the cot.  Today my main task is tidying and cleaning. I have a mountain of ironing from the holiday washing, but I like ironing. I can catch up on the latest episode of The Apprentice while I'm doing it. Cleaning bathrooms I don't like so much but I must grit my teeth and just get on with it. I'll bribe myself with a reward for after I've done them.
