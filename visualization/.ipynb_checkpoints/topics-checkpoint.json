and then add in the vegan basil pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you

I find this often. I have something to <b>talk</b> about, sometimes it needs several <b>session</b>s to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the <b>session</b>s, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision <b>last</b> week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave <b>session</b>s on time. \u201cNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on <b>talk</b>ing.\u201d After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her.

She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that \u201c<b>ok</b> Faith, time is up\u201d, I too will just carry on.

I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -\u201c I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. \u201cOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that.

I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.\u201d T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. \u201cBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.\u201d I thought for a moment and said \u201cSo\u2026uh\u2026 that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending <b>therapy</b> altogether.

I had things to <b>talk</b> about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd <b>felt</b> important when I wrote them down, suddenly in <b>session</b> they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative.

The first half of the <b>session</b> was a <b>bit</b> stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she <b>felt</b> we weren't really connecting this <b>session</b>. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to <b>talk</b> about it with others because I know we have <b>talk</b>ed about it here in <b>therapy</b>.

I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b>s, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it to<b>ok</b> me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page.

I only fully stopped believing that after  years of <b>therapy</b> when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said <b>maybe</b> it would be good to think about what I believed when I started <b>therapy</b> and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a <b>bit</b> of a \u201c<b>maybe</b>\u201d face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born\u2026 and over here Faith started <b>therapy</b> [I was gesturing with my hands]\u2026 and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started <b>therapy</b>? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started <b>therapy</b> and that could be our starting place for next <b>session</b>. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this <b>session</b> <b>felt</b> more connected and flowed more easily.

It was all good really, because T knows how much I have struggled in my connection with her over the years. I think d's attachment to me may have been damaged when she was a baby because my eating disorder was at its worst and I wasn't as emotionally available for her as I could have been. I've been trying to make up for that time ever since I learnt more about attachment and could start to make sense of what was going on between us. This <b>last</b> year feels like it has been really healing for us. I found some small actions that d allowed me to do for her, and that started building more connection between us and seemed to let her start to take some nurture in. It's been tentative certainly on my part for months, wanting to push things but just the right amount, never quite sure exactly how much connection d will tolerate before she pushes me away. But now things feels so much better. Maybe it's been lockdown and having her at home and \u201cin the nest\u201d with me and that b<b>last</b> of more intensive nurturing. Maybe it's partly her age, growing through the age of , which in my three times of experience is not the nicest age. It was really good to <b>talk</b> about all this with T. It's all been going on in the background for the <b>last</b> year and longer and to reflect on it with T was helpful. I <b>talk</b>ed about how I had to override my mums voice in my head so many times, when I was trying to do small things to build connection with d. My mums voice that says \u201cshe can do that for herself!\u201d and I imagine my mum shaking her head and thinking I am babying d. So I have had to learn to go against that, and although I know my mum can't see what I'm doing, I still <b>felt</b> guilty and wrong when I do so. I said to T that sometimes I feel a <b>bit</b> naughty doing something I know my mum would roll her eyes at, and T punched the air and said YESSSSS We <b>talk</b>ed a little <b>bit</b> about reading between the lines and how my parents could act like they were giving me a choice about something, while it not really being a choice because I also knew what they wanted me to choose. Kind of like \u201coh yes, you can do xyz if you like - but you'll have to do it for yourself/ pay for it yourself/ sort it out yourself\u201d while knowing full well that any of those things would be beyond me in that situation. As a sensitive child, I could completely read that situation that meant that actually they didn't want me to do those things, and because I wanted to please them and avoid conflict, I would then go with the choice that I knew they wanted me to choose. A sort of emotional blackmail by my parents. I wanted to tie this in with T telling me the week before that she would always be honest and real with me, and how much that meant. The relief that she would just be upfront with me and I didn't have to read between the lines and try and figure out about what she might be actually be saying.

Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don't know what your <b>therapist</b>s rules on texting are so I can't know how she'd respond if you texted her. Also if it's an issue that you know you don't see eye to eye on, then it's really best discussed in a <b>therapy</b> <b>session</b> rather than by text, so you don't end up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you've been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next <b>session</b>?

"<b>self</b>-love doesn't mean that you always feel good about your<b>self</b>.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is recognizing and affirming your<b>self</b> for who you really are.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is accepting your<b>self</b> however you show up on any given day.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is honoring your<b>self</b> and your body even when you don't feel good.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is being honest with your<b>self</b> about where you're at and what is really <b>best</b> for you.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is knowing that your worth doesn't change even when you do.\n\n<b>self</b>-love is freedom, and being free is
