As for the hair pulling, I have trichotillomania, Ive had it for just over a decade. There are some things that are worth trying but the for sure way (for me personally) to stop the pulling is to Remove the hair so theres nothing left to pullTherapyIve had super short af hair in the past, and I do love it, but Ive worked hard to grow it out long. When its long I can put tinsel in it.. I dont pull from my head much anymore (yay), i pull from my brows and lashes (not yay). Been trying to grow my brows out under my bangs but every time i make progress i get trichy and destroy them again. Just gotta keep trying and also I gotta work on my stress and anxieties. High anxiety means lots of pulling. Idk man.. Maybe Ill put socks on my hands when I go to bed to prevent me from laying awake pulling lmao

It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.

-
 months did originally sound like a short duration of time when this plan was in the works, but I guess it is a pretty big adventure . . . and I mean, it is definitely my biggest yet 👀
-
But in that time I'll have been back to Thailand (this place is so special to me 🫶🏻), and then I'll have visited both Cambodia and Vietnam for the first time ever!!! I am buzzingggggg you guys 🇹🇭🇰🇭🇻🇳

The Berlin vlog was episode  in the Germany series (link in my bio), but if I had to pick my top  recommendations then I'd say the following:
-
🇩🇪 Go and chill at Tempelhof, the decommissioned airport  ✈️
-
🇩🇪 Vegan or not, you mustttt try the doughnuts from @brammibalsdonuts  😍
-
🇩🇪 And if you're there next year around the same time, go and either run in the Berlin City Nights event, just go and watch or visit the Irish pub nearby (I heard it was good 🙃👌🏻)

The Hamburg vlog will be next so stay tuneddddd for that and happy hump day from me my friends ✌🏻💚

Also, zoom in again on my @danielwellington watch and matching rose gold cuff which I honestly looooooove ✨ Last minute Christmas gift ideas guys: Get % off all gift sets and an additional % off using my code VEGANHOLLY 🎁

There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 2872, distribution: 0.9974575902169718 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 3290, distribution: 0.9972053245796927 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 2316, distribution: 0.9971463351393849 ; Therapy .. // building connections with d  We mostly talked about how things with d have been. It was all good really, because T knows how much I have struggled in my connection with her over the years. I think d's attachment to me may have been damaged when she was a baby because my eating disorder was at its worst and I wasn't as emotionally available for her as I could have been. I've been trying to make up for that time ever since I learnt more about attachment and could start to make sense of what was going on between us. This last year feels like it has been really healing for us. I found some small actions that d allowed me to do for her, and that started building more connection between us and seemed to let her start to take some nurture in. It's been tentative certainly on my part for months, wanting to push things but just the right amount, never quite sure exactly how much connection d will tolerate before she pushes me away. But now things feels so much better. Maybe it's been lockdown and having her at home and “in the nest” with me and that blast of more intensive nurturing. Maybe it's partly her age, growing through the age of , which in my three times of experience is not the nicest age. It was really good to talk about all this with T. It's all been going on in the background for the last year and longer and to reflect on it with T was helpful. I talked about how I had to override my mums voice in my head so many times, when I was trying to do small things to build connection with d. My mums voice that says “she can do that for herself!” and I imagine my mum shaking her head and thinking I am babying d. So I have had to learn to go against that, and although I know my mum can't see what I'm doing, I still felt guilty and wrong when I do so. I said to T that sometimes I feel a bit naughty doing something I know my mum would roll her eyes at, and T punched the air and said YESSSSS We talked a little bit about reading between the lines and how my parents could act like they were giving me a choice about something, while it not really being a choice because I also knew what they wanted me to choose. Kind of like “oh yes, you can do xyz if you like - but you'll have to do it for yourself/ pay for it yourself/ sort it out yourself” while knowing full well that any of those things would be beyond me in that situation. As a sensitive child, I could completely read that situation that meant that actually they didn't want me to do those things, and because I wanted to please them and avoid conflict, I would then go with the choice that I knew they wanted me to choose. A sort of emotional blackmail by my parents. I wanted to tie this in with T telling me the week before that she would always be honest and real with me, and how much that meant. The relief that she would just be upfront with me and I didn't have to read between the lines and try and figure out about what she might be actually be saying. But that's what we ran out of time to talk about so I will try and bring it up in tomorrow's session.

Doc ID: 4071, distribution: 0.9969806313703323 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said “”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.” I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

Doc ID: 4554, distribution: 0.9968974834434916 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before.

Usually she asks me “So, where to today?” or something similar. Today I think she said something like “I wanted to ask you a question” or “Can I ask you something?”. Anytime she says something like that, I immediately feel anxious. Something slightly out of the ordinary puts me on high alert. I nodded though that she could ask me, so she said “How do you feel therapy is going?”  She must have seen the look of fear that crossed my face, because she immediately followed up with “That's not a trick question. I'm not expecting any particular answer” and several other reassuring phrases. Then she said that she did have a few thoughts on it herself, but she would tell me them in a minute. I thought she might be referring to what I'd said last week, when I said I felt like therapy was running away with me and I keep not getting round to finishing talking about a subject before something else took over. I repeated those thoughts, and then T started to tell me what she'd obviously been waiting to say but couldn't until she'd done this sort of fake lead-in. It feels fake because I think she was only asking my thoughts so she could then tell me her thoughts. I'm not sure she really listened to my answer. Then she said that she had been thinking about therapy, and about how it was progressing, and where it was going. Very quickly, she added “I'm not talking about us ending, I'm not saying I think we should end. But I know you have brought the subject of ending up once or twice, so I know it's there in the back of your mind too.” I'm looking at her very suspiciously by this point, sitting very still with one hand curled up in front of my mouth.  She continued “When you started therapy, it was like I had to take you by the hand and lead you, like a small child. Then gradually you grew, so it was like we were walking along side by side, like you were a teenager or young adult. And now it feels like you have grown more and you are going ahead of me, and I need to step back and let you lead the way.” She finished speaking and I just sat, frozen, with my hand up over my mouth. I sat like that for what felt like a long time, and T sat in silence with me. Maybe she had asked me my thoughts on it when she'd finished speaking, I can't remember. I'd gone off into freeze mode. My brain heard her talk about endings and growing up and leading the way, and I hate it. I hate it all. I don't want it. I want to just carry on as we are doing. What's wrong with how it is? It's just fine. Just stop saying all this stuff.

Doc ID: 3261, distribution: 0.9967792243636056 ; Therapy .. // Sad  This therapy session did not really go where I expected it to go. It ended up making me feel really sad. I started off telling T about a situation that happened this week with the car. It was meant to be a positive thing to talk about, because it was a situation that would have usually sent me spiralling into anxiety and a feeling of overwhelming dread. Instead, I managed to get outside of that and remind myself that this was one of those situations where I feel like the world is ending, but it isn't. That even though right now I feel like it's a insurmountable obstacle, actually when I calm down I will have a different perspective on it and I will know that we can sort it out. So far so good. I said something like “I know that whatever the outcome, our family will be able to find a solution.” What I meant by that was that we are financially in a situation where worst case scenario we could hire a car or even buy a car if we needed to. T picked up on the 'our family' bit, and she started on about how I'm not on my own. It made me feel really sad, because actually I do feel on my own. Not physically, not financially, but emotionally. In terms of family life, planning, thinking ahead. “H just lives very much in the moment” I said. T said how it was good he was laid back because he balances my worrying and if we were both like me, maybe we would have a much more turbulent relationship. It's not often I feel like she doesn't get me, but this session, I felt like that. Her trying to tell me I'm not on my own made me feel more on my own than ever. H is not going to change. He is not going to make me feel emotionally looked after. I am always going to be the one that is looking after everyone. I'm quite resigned to that and accepting of it. But don't sit there T and tell me I'm not on my own, because I am and that is the reality of the situation and if T doesn't get that, that makes me feel even more in my own. I got all quiet and sad in session then, and T said “oh that was supposed to be a good thing and it's taken a bit of a turn”. I tried to bring it back by repeating the good bits of how I had taken myself out of the downward spiral, and T was nodding and agreeing but I still didn't feel like she fully understood what a big thing it was for me. And I didn't feel like she understood when she made the “you're not on your own” comment. So I lapsed back into feeling a bit subdued. I thought about saying “you're just not getting me today”. The words formed in my head as we sat in silence. But then T said “So…. where to next?” and I cast the words aside and jumped in a different direction instead.

Doc ID: 2402, distribution: 0.9967006225796132 ; Therapy .. // no change please  We had a slightly awkward start to this session (when do I not have an awkward start?) as I always struggle with those opening lines and how to get going. Also T seemed completely fine and oblivious to the fact that I might be unhappy after last session. I think whether she picks up on it or not, she always opens the session in a neutral way rather than pulling in the mood that the previous session ended in. That gives me the option of picking up from last session, or starting with something fresh. I'm going to try and write in a way that shows how we repaired our rupture. I guess anyone in a long term therapy relationship experiences ruptures and they probably all get repaired slightly differently depending on the therapist and the client and the situation.  “Can we talk about last weeks session?” I asked haltingly. T was still all happy and I think oblivious to the fact that all was not well after last week. She nodded and said “Yes of course” and then waited. “Uh… so when you said what you said about therapy changing…” - T nodded and remembered what she'd said - “well, why did you say that?” “Well it was an observation I suppose. It's good to notice how therapy is going.” “Mmm… It felt like you were saying you wanted to change things.” T said that she thought it was more that she was noticing things that had already changed. She talked about when I'd had the episode with my neighbour that upset me, and how I had known that I was triggered because it reminded me of my dad. “That's when I thought, oh Faith is further along here that I'd realised. She doesn't need me to make the connection for her anymore.” I said how scary talk of change is for me and how it unsettles me that T might change things in therapy. T repeated that maybe what she really meant was that she had noticed I had made progress and so there had already been change, and she needed to move with it. That's what she had meant when she said it, rather than she wanted to deliberately make a change from how we were doing things now. I felt reassured on that front and some of that fear that she was going to deliberately engineer sessions to be somehow different started to ease. After about  minutes of conversation, I paused and T asked if we had covered that now. “Shall we park it there now…. or do you want to keep talking about it?” I was so not done with talking about it! I still had a lot of thoughts that I hadn't said yet. Little did T know! It took me a minute to get the words out, “I think I need to keep talking about it”

The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says “Where to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about…. what we were talking about last week?” “I feel like I'm in a gap between those two things” “Ok, well…. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?” I nod. T flips a page in front of her. “You said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?” That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says “So you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?” “Uh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.” “Did you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?” “Noooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.” “Hmm and did you feel that I felt like that?” “Well nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.” We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? “No, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think… I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit… *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.” I hadn't “stopped eating”, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached.

Did you know that my content started out being solely focused on health & fitness? I posted mainly photos like the ones on the left & my intentions were good, of course, to inspire others to be their healthiest, happiest selves & motivate them/you. But there was one thing that wasn't sitting right with me… & that's the fact that my body didn't always look like that. Most of the time it looks like the photos on the right. Even though I'm active, lift weights, go for daily walks & I have a balanced diet.

So I didn't want other people to come to my page & feel motivated to make healthy choices & work on their fitness all in the hopes of reaching a specific body goal.

Because it's not about that. Making healthy choices is really about the wellness of your mind & body. Your body isn't a reflection of you, it's just the magnificent vehicle that takes you everywhere you need to go & keeps you alive. But outside of that, we really give it far too much power over the way we live our lives & the way we feel.

🌸 you are SO MUCH MORE than a body 🌸

So if yours has armpit fat, body hair, tummy rolls, excess skin, fat, touching thighs, cellulite, lack of curves, pimples, stretch marks, etc… LET IT 🤷‍♀️

You don't need to “fix” a thing.

No matter how healthy & fit you are, you'll likely always find something to be unhappy with, unless you're being kinder to yourself from the inside out.

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9963694337659299 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

I've spoken a lot about my kg weight loss journey, but here's a dedicated post about my experience with weight GAIN.

The photo on the left was me at the end of my weight loss journey, I weighed kgs & had lost my menstrual cycle due to being underweight. Becoming this lean wasn't my intention or goal at first, and I lost weight in a healthy way, it's just that I kept losing weight longer than I needed to because I still wasn't entirely happy with myself when I thought I would be. That's when I realised health has to come first and my mindset/self-thoughts were the things I had to change. So if you think you're going to be happy once you lose weight or 'get skinny', think again. Becoming happy in your skin starts NOW, no matter where you are in your health journey, no matter what your body looks like... It's not something that just happens... Confidence and self-love happens with time, practise, rewiring your mindset, living a happy/healthy lifestyle & plenty of kind thoughts. 

Our weight is ALWAYS going to fluctuate throughout our lives, but that doesn't mean our love for ourselves has to. Your body deserves proper nourishment, it needs time to rest & recover, it needs FAT to surround and insulate vital organs. Believe it or not, the fat on our body is like a fuel tank, it's an energy reserve to protect us against starvation... How bloody amazing is it that our bodies operate this way?! 

So, the next time you think negatively about weight gain or 'fat', remember that your body wouldn't function properly without it & it's perfectly healthy to have cushion on your bones!! ☁️ 🥰 ✨

Disclaimer: this isn't to discredit the positive impact my weight loss journey had on me — it's ultimately why I'm where I'm at today with health & confidence! But health is # 🍌🍔🥬🍕

Doc ID: 2316, distribution: 0.9962712462914721 ; There are  MILLION results when you search “how to get rid of belly fat” 🥺⤵️

 million results for “how to get rid of loose skin”

More than  million results for “how to get rid of stretch marks”

. million results for “how to get rid of cellulite”

. million for “how to get rid of hip dips”

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. To feel ashamed of them. But these features are human.

Most of the time, the internet (social media especially) makes people feel worse, rather than better 😅

It can negatively impact body image & sleep, increase bullying & FOMO, and lead to greater feelings of anxiety, depression & loneliness.

But that doesn't have to be your experience.

The messages we consume on a daily basis really do matter… and if the messages we're consuming are full of unrealistic expectations, highlight reels of people's lives, posed/edited photos, sunshine & rainbows, then we'll start to wonder why our lives don't look the same. And all of a sudden, our life/body/career/relationships aren't good enough. 

Don't get me wrong, the internet is an incredible tool, it's something I personally LOVE & sometimes what we see of others online is inspiring & can propel our mindset in a positive direction… But other times, it's self-sabotage… It makes us compare ourselves, feel incomplete & behind in life.

I think we underestimate how important it is to set healthy boundaries & be mindful of the content we're consuming every day.

Protect your peace. Fill your online world with content that makes you feel GOOD. Content that makes you feel seen. People who inspire you & empower you. 

And remember that social media isn't always reality, it isn't always the full picture (well, it NEVER is) so please don't be so hard on yourself. You're exactly where you're supposed to be at this point in time 🌻 

Happy Real Me Monday 🥰

It would be so easy to portray the image on the left as my everyday self & hide all of the features we've been taught to hate.

I personally spent years yo-yo dieting, self-loathing & following unhealthy fad d!ets because of the pressure I felt to look a certain way, but none of it ever worked or stuck.

And as I learned how to create a more balanced & healthy approach to my lifestyle & habits, I realised I never saw anyone who appeared to live a “fit & healthy lifestyle” still have belly fat, wobbly legs & arms, loose skin, stretch marks, back acne & so many other things I've seen on myself. 

I thought something was wrong with me.

This is why I'm here now, to show you that:
🧘🏻‍♀️ a healthy, balanced lifestyle shouldn't be restrictive or miserable
🥰 having very normal human features - like wobbly, jiggly, dimply bits - isn't something you need to “fix” or hate… it's simply part of being human, all bodies are different!
⚡️ food & body fat isn't your enemy, it's ENERGY
🥹 you are already good enough
💪 our bodies will forever fluctuate & change, so learning to respect it for what it does for you is life-changing
⚠️ no amount of external validation will make you love yourself… self acceptance comes from the inside.
🪞 the way things look on the outside may not be a reflection of how things actually are on the inside. The measures people take to live a certain lifestyle may not be realistic for you, so you cannot compare yourself!!
🫂 the body on the left isn't the way I look all the time & I hope to be just one person who shows you that you can show up as you are, because I wouldn't have been able to truly accept myself if I didn't embrace ALL of me. 

I know my posts won't resonate with everyone, but I do hope it reaches those it will help in some way! Happy Real Me Monday 🫶

Doc ID: 2534, distribution: 0.9961887879054102 ; What if instead of viewing your body as this work in progress, this thing that you wish to change, this thing you *will* love one day, but only once it's smaller, firmer, more “beautiful”…. You view your body, in the exact shape and size it is now, as the version of your body you'll have forever instead. If it were to never change & forever be the exact same, do you think you can put in the effort to TRY to appreciate it? Instead of being unkind to it?

I think for so many of us, we view our bodies as this thing that needs to be fixed. We don't really even try to accept it or be happy with it because we believe that only happens when we reach a certain physique, shape, size. But problems are still problems in a size . So, what if we start being kinder to it now? 

Idk about you, but I'm not willing to settle for a life of self-loathing & low self-esteem 🙅‍♀️

Here are some tips to create a better relationship with your body & mind that personally helped me:

🌟 What you focus on is what you give power to! Be kind to yourself 😘

🌟 If your mind isn't in a good place, try not to look in the mirror. 

🌟 If you're having a bad body image day, do something that brings you joy & show yourself some self love!

🌟 Repeat affirmations to yourself every day, until you start to think them naturally!

🌟 Throw away clothes that don't fit you. They don't serve you anymore 🤗

🌟 Throw away the scales. The number doesn't define you! 

🌟 Nourish your body well… Enjoy the food you eat. Fuel yourself with food that makes you feel good, inside & out.

🌟 Make some time to move your body, whether it's stretching, walking, dancing, bodyweight exercises, or hitting PBs at the gym. Move in whichever way makes you feel best. Your body is powerful & strong! 

🌟 Consume content online that inspires you, motivates you & leaves you feeling better, not worse. If that means finding new people to follow & others to unfollow, so be it. Your mental health comes first 💛

Doc ID: 9562, distribution: 0.9961676002969653 ; i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they're meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

Doc ID: 2595, distribution: 0.9961676002969653 ; Now THIS is what I wish I saw in the media growing up… 📰

If I saw other women with realistic, relatable, healthy & normal features in magazines growing up, it would've caused my confidence to: 📈 instead of: 📉

Instead, we see the photoshopped versions of the people we look up to, and when we do see someone with similar features to us, it's plastered all over the front page with derogatory headlines (swipe across to see what I mean 😓)

 in  women struggle with their body image… Are you one of them? If you are, leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments & if you're not, leave a “🥰”.

We're quite literally brought up to believe the body we're born in needs to be fixed & scared into new short-term, unsustainable diet fads each week instead of being inspired to be our healthiest & happiest selves long-term.

Now, I know I can't possibly represent everyone because we all have different body types & live different lifestyles, but I guarantee that if we were educated on how normal (& common) these features are & saw diverse bodies of all sizes, shapes, colours, disabilities, etc being represented & accepted, I think the amount of women & men who struggle with their body image would be so much lower. 

Can you just imagine how the -year-old version of yourself would've felt if Britney Spears was on the front cover, cellulite & all, EXCEPT with a positive, uplifting headline about how happy she looks, rather than tearing down the PERFECTLY NORMAL cellulite on her legs? (Swipe across to see the cover I'm talking about 👉🏻)

The more we see it, the more we normalise it… So while the reality may not be embraced in magazines, you can still choose what you consume online. So curate your feed carefully! Opt in for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse 🌟

Living a life full of things that makes you happy > being miserable on your endeavour to look a certain way.

I'm not saying your body isn't important. Your body is this incredible vehicle that keeps you alive & deserves appreciation, but not for how it looks… for what it DOES!

So often we risk our mental health for our physical appearance.

There's this universal belief that in order to be “healthy” or look a certain way, you need to sacrifice the things you love. But realistically, by drastically changing your life & cutting out things that bring you joy, won't that just make you feel miserable & restricted in return?

I promise you, your physical body & mental health can BOTH thrive at the same time, it's not just one or the other. You can live a healthy lifestyle without sacrificing things. You CAN eat the food that provides high quality energy for your body & also the food that simply tastes good. You can workout in ways you enjoy, it's not a one-size-fits-all! You can rest! You can embrace your body with all of those beautiful lil things society deems “imperfect”! You can enjoy yo' life!

Please, don't let your body shape or appearance become a higher priority than your happiness. 

Don't be so hard on yourself for not looking a certain way… Your appearance is the least interesting thing about you 🙏🏼

You can do whatever you want to with your body, if you wanna change it, okay then go for it 😊, if you wanna learn to accept it as it is, AMAZING… I'm not here to tell you one is right & one is wrong, I'm just here to remind you that you can be both HAPPY & HEALTHY at the same time. Approaching your health & happiness in a balanced way is EVERYTHING. 

Go create those healthy, balanced, flexible habits that ADD to your life, not detract from it 🎉

So how do we stop giving it the power to stop us from feeling ✨ good ✨ ???

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love social media — but it can be a black hole full of people sharing their best life & best versions of themselves, so it makes sense that we'll find ourselves comparing our own lives & bodies while scrolling through. 

Here are some things that helped me stop comparing myself to others:

🦋 Her/his beauty and/or success doesn't take away from yours
🦋 A flaw is something that mars/weakens a subject - does your cellulite weaken you? Nope!!
🦋 Perfection is an illusion - we only see what someone wants us to see. The photos that are posted are only % of someone's life. There are  hours in each day, and we usually only see a few minutes of someone's life online so we really are blind to the real challenges people face every day.
🦋 Bad body image days happen to us all — so if you think weight loss or a makeover is going to magically fix that, you're in for a shock 🙈 finding peace with your body and appearance happens when you start working from the inside out (internally / mentally) ✨
🦋 We're all living on a different timeline. Mark Zuckerberg might've created his multi-million dollar company in his dorm room as a teen, but Vera Wang didn't design her first dress until . 
🦋 Beauty is subjective - you might not see your beauty, but you also don't see the way your eyes light up at the sight of puppies or sunsets, so how can you really ever know your true beauty when you've only ever seen yourself in a mirror or in photos?
🦋 Some things can't be changed - you want to be younger??? That's just not possible, so why dwell on it? Right now is the youngest you'll ever be ever again, so enjoy it! 🙈

I really don't know if this will help… But I thought I'd share a few things that helped me 🥰 

Do you find yourself comparing to others? And if so, does it tend to be comparing their physical appearance to yours OR their life / successes to yours??? Let's talk about it ✨

in a separate bowl mix:
-  / cups almond flour
- pinch of sea salt, cinnamon, baking powder

pour wet into dry and stir until a smooth batter forms. pour into pan and bake for about - minutes.

- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water    
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :)

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - sautéed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time.

 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream.
