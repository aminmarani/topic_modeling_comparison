Doc ID: 2698, distribution: 0.9728998457733636 ; Question: I've always wondered about you referring to foster caring as a job. Where I live, people who have foster children also work outside the home at full time jobs. I know you care specifically for very young babies so is it because of that or is foster care just different where you live? Answer: In the UK, if you foster care for a baby you can't really work. If you worked then you'd have to put the baby in daycare and that sort of goes against what you're trying to achieve in terms of building a secure attachment. But also babies have lots of contact with birth families during the week and you need to be around to facilitate that, and also meetings, reviews, and appointments. So it's not really practical to have another job at the same time.It is possible to work in a job outside the home if you foster older children who are in school, but probably not working full time and you would need a flexible job so that you can be available during the day if needed for meetings etc. It's also about having enough mental physical and emotional energy for the therapeutic parenting that children in care often need. It might be hard to have the energy to give these children what they need if you're working, it's hard enough working and having your own birth children, never mind children who need even more from you (as they rightly should).

Yes it's GREAT to eat food that's good for your body and health, but it's also good to eat food that makes you happy. There's food for your body and food for your soul... Both are important!

In saying that, I'm not encouraging you to live on McDonald's OR live on kale... I'm encouraging you to enjoy a balance of food that supports your physical and mental health! If eating junk makes you feel terrible both physically and mentally, maybe focusing on introducing more nutritional foods is a good idea. The same goes with a % clean eating diet... If you're feeling miserable living on brussel sprouts and missing out on dining out with friends, maybe balancing your diet with some more treats is a good idea. Food isn't your enemy, it's a part of our every day lives and it's a privilege! Enjoy it! ü•∞

Doc ID: 2580, distribution: 0.9645964698174018 ; Internally debating whether to message T and tell her I got the vaccine. On the one hand, unnecessary. But on the other hand, permissible. I'm sure if I sent it, she'd send back a simple reply like a thumbs up or a smiley face, which would have the effect of a) a nice little connection and b) bump her back up to the top of my whatsapp list. But really, I don't need to send it. It would just be a little boundary push that I think would be fairly harmless buuuut yeah, I can survive without doing it. And it will be more satisfying to tell her in session, face to face, when we can have a proper conversation about it. So on that basis, I will wait.

Doc ID: 2580, distribution: 0.9645964698174018 ; It's reported that % of people won't post a picture online without editing it. This app, in particular, has had more than  MILLION DOWNLOADS‚Ä¶

We exist in a world today where everything can be faked or fixed. Stomachs can be tightened, skin and cellulite can be smoothed, legs can be firmed, waists can be pinched, makeup can be edited on. You can ‚Äúimprove‚Äù your entire appearance with just a few clicks.

When our first instinct after looking at a picture of ourselves is how to alter it, something is missing. We live in a time where we don't just compare ourselves to other people, we even compare ourselves the ‚ÄúInstagram version‚Äù of ourselves. 

This is not only potentially damaging to the people who see it and compare themselves to you, it's also damaging to YOU, the person who only feels beautiful in their photos once you've tweaked them.

Please remember a camera lens can't possibly capture the true beauty of a sunset, the height of a mountain or the tranquility of rain. So it's hardly fair to expect the camera to capture your true uniqueness and beauty.

It took me a while to come to terms with this too. I, myself, used to edit my photos like no tomorrow. It got to a point where I was afraid to see people in person because I worried they wouldn't think I was beautiful in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù‚Ä¶ but what I really should've worried about was how I viewed and spoke to myself‚Ä¶ and worked on that instead. 

In a time where you can download an app and change yourself within a few seconds, choose to be kind to yourself instead. Don't opt for a bandaid fix, focus on a lifelong solution. You're free to be different, to be real and come as you are. You are so incredibly wonderful, don't you forget it üò†ü•∞ü§ç

Please make sure you keep yourself healthy above all, but if you're eating slightly more than usual don't blame yourself for it! It's normal and circumstances are very stressful right now. Not having a routine can be very difficult for people with executive dysfunction as well, and if you've lost all track of time and can't manage to do anything at all anymore that's okay! Take your time to recollect and make a plan and new routine for yourself to follow. Start small, and make sure it's reasonable so you can stick with itI love you all, times are scary and uncertain right now. Take care of yourselves 
Thank you! Its been tough, im overeating constantly and have been in sweatpants the entire time to hide myself. But, im almost . Gaining weight is one of the most natural things to happen at my age. A grown woman gotta look like a grown woman. Its still hard to accept but i know everything is temporary and the only one who cares is me. When life gets back to normal things will settle down for me and my eating will level out i think. Just gotta forgive and move on, no point in stressing over it all. Stay safe yall. Stay home. Wash your hands and disinfect your living space daily: your phone, remotes, controllers, makeup brushes, faucet handles, door knobs, fridge and microwave etc!

If you spend your recovery making those cute stereotypical Recovery Warrior meals for Instagram, thats cute and all, but youre still micromanaging your meals. Thats not recovery. You cant rely on having magical healthy and nutritional perfect recovery meals. You just cant. Thats fucking dumb. Non disordered people dont do that. Yes enjoy fruits and veggies.But yes enjoy sugars and carbs. I developed a strong sweet tooth in my recovery. Would I have chosen that? No. But its not my job to micromanage that. Its my job to eat some food and go live my life. If you think controlling your healthy meals is recovery, it aint. Just because you are eating does not mean you have let go of your disorder.

brown rice and lentil pilaf with caramelized onions:
i made this on a whim but here's what went down! i saut√©ed an onion in olive oil until caramelized and placed to the side. then i added some pre-steamed brown rice and pre-cooked lentils to a pot with enough vegetable stock to cover. i brought this to a boil and then reduced heat to low and covered, stirring occasionally until the liquid was all absorbed! at the end i drizzled in some balsamic vinegar, more sea salt, and threw the onions on top! .

  I Will Not Be Eaten  
 Girl. Yes. 
 
 The voices of little girls are so powerful and profound because they haven't yet been completely eaten away at by social conditioning.¬† 
 

 ‚ÄúI am a rich pie filled with knowledge. I will not be eaten.‚Äù Holy fuck my new motto.  
 
 Transcription (with original line breaks): 
 
  The true feminine  
  I am not sugar and spice and everything nice. I am music, I am art. I am a story. I am a church bell, gonging out wrongs and rights and normal nights. I was baby. I am child. I will be mother. I don't mind being considered beautiful, I do not allow that to be my definition. I am a rich pie strong with knowledge. I will not be eaten.   
 
 
 i'm not kidding, this poem shook me to my core. it inspired me more than any famous poet in the past few months. this little girl is going to influence the world in such a beautiful way. 
 

 little girls are gonna rule the goddamn world 
 


 This is why society works so hard to stifle girls and women.

Doc ID: 4817, distribution: 0.8779041428008569 ; A rupture within a rupture?  T made a comment in my session this week that sometimes I lose weight to punish her. She made a similar comment the week before. She thinks that's what I'm doing now. I told her that I'm not consciously doing that. I appreciate that eating disorders are not fundamentally about the food, and a big aspect of them is to do with struggles in being ourselves and keeping ourselves safe and contained in relationships with other people. So I'm not denying that there's an element of relationship struggle going on somewhere in the midst of it all. However when T upsets me, I don't consciously think ‚ÄúI'll teach her a lesson by losing weight‚Äù. In this rupture, she said some very unhelpful things which triggered me and it was like a wall came down in my head and took away the option of snacking. Because of the statements she made about snacking!! And as a consequence of not snacking, I lost weight. So I don't see how that is me choosing to punish her.  I'll hold my hands up and say there was one time when I lost weight to punish her and that was last November. She wouldn't believe me that I had unintentionally lost  lbs. After this recent episode I know exactly why I lost those  lbs, because the same situation occurred as his occurred this time. I stopped snacking and started walking a lot at the same time (we were on holiday in China). It's exactly what's happened this time. T was adamant it was the eating disorder and I got really frustrated with her not hearing me and decided to show her what the eating disorder could do if I really listened to it. The  lbs I lost that week was deliberate and out of frustration and to teach her a lesson.  It wasn't my best idea. Ok it was a terrible idea and was the start of a slow-burning rupture that carried on for weeks. But it's the only time I've consciously decided to lose weight to punish T. It feels like now she's making it all about her. And she doesn't understand what it's like in my head when the eating disorder kicks in. It's like suddenly a bunch of rules come into play out of nowhere and it feels almost impossible to disobey them. I don't sit there and think, oh now how could I lose some weight, what could I do? like some sort of rational decision making process. Is this a rupture within a rupture üò≥

I know there's been a lot of conversation about the New York abortion stuff. I'm not going to attempt in this post to clear up the misinformation that's spreading on what is actually happening in those laws - y'all can use google for that. What I want to do is provide a (virtual) spiritual witness / counter narrative to what is being put out there about the divine.
 I am a person of deep faith (I'm even getting a master's degree in theological studies!) and I support abortion as part of reproductive healthcare. there is no contradiction - in fact, my faith compels me to do justly. so I fight for the best quality of life for all involved. it becomes abundantly clear that justice is not a priority for the ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù movement if we are talking about these rare cases (past  weeks) when a woman's life is in danger if the pregnancy continues and evangelicals are willing to sacrifice her as long as she gives birth. I've seen comments on comments about How Dare a woman not want her own child to live, even if it meant giving up her life in the process of bringing that child into being. y'all, that is not a god that I believe in or want anything to do with - a god who cares so little for the lived realities of the women involved. if you have had to make that difficult decision, know that I believe in a Divine One who is deeply compassionate, loving, and fiercely on the side of the vulnerable. that god is not ashamed of you or angry with you or the least bit disappointed in you. you are loved, you are seen, and you are whole.

So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don't know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I've mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These  exercise I did for  minute each, and repeated the whole circuit  times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise  // Lat pull down //  minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise  // Seated chest fly //  minute
Keep your arms slightly bent and shoulder blades pinned back.
Exercise  // Flat chest press //  minute
Don't lock your elbows at the top, have a slight arch in your back and press your feet firmly against the ground. 
Exercise //  Low row //  minute
Pull your elbows in and back, and hold then the squeeze for a second or so to feel the burn.

Her boundaries with me around texting have changed over the time I've been seeing her as the therapy has progressed. I stay within the boundaries we agree and I know she would tell me if it became a problem. I really appreciate her allowing me to text (although when we started therapy, I texted her with no idea that out-of-session contact was a Thing). It has been really helpful in building up the therapeutic relationship and helping me feel safe with her and in my earlier days of eating disorder recovery, it was so so helpful to hear from her at times when I was freaking out over food. A lot of my internal voice around eating now comes from things she said by text.

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

- complete a bachelor's (or master's degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January , , a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an ‚ÄúInternship.‚Äù some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete  hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration's registration exam
- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. / of the United States require licensure to practice. 
- maintain continuing education -  hours every  years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the ‚Äúnutritionist‚Äù title isn't regulated so there's no guarantee of the experience and education that they've had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients ‚Äîand to the world. good (i say this because i can't blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

We thought it was going to fail because I put too much oil in it a few months ago and nearly blew it up. That's a bit of a long story that has been in and out of my therapy sessions the last few weeks but essentially boiled down to me getting excessively anxious and consequently rational thinking went out of the window.  I thought its MOT wasn't due till September so I thought we'd be ok for our holidays and trips in August, then I got a reminder email at the start of August saying it was due in two weeks. I only managed not to go into complete meltdown mode because of the work we've done in therapy over not catastrophising, and managing to get outside of my overwhelming thoughts and get them into perspective.  And now it's passed and I'm so glad I didn't let myself waste a chunk of my life panicking about something that in the end didn't ever happen. But still so relieved!

We went back and forth a bit and eventually I said ‚Äúok, say it then.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you know that list you showed me last week about all the steps in recovery? And being able to buy yourself a snack while you're out is just about the last thing left on it‚Ä¶ I'm wondering if you might be thinking - subconsciously, I mean - if you don't want to be able to eat cake because that would mean you would have to finish therapy.‚Äù I looked at T a bit weirdly. That honestly has not crossed my mind. If I can go out and treat myself to cake, there are still other bits and pieces of eating disorder behaviours I could choose to work on (oh gosh she knows some of the things I do, I know I have told her them) or there is other relationship stuff we could work on. I don't feel at all like being able to eat cake would automatically mean Bingo! I was done!  But of course the stupid thing about things like this when a therapist says ‚Äúoh it's not your conscious mind‚Äù is that you can't win that argument. If you disagree, they just say that's because you're not aware of it.  I said to T that I didn't think that was true at all and it hadn't crossed my mind, and true to form she said something very similar to what I just wrote. I felt like the more I argued with her, the more she might think it was indeed true, so I just kind of shrugged and gave her a weak smile. I told her I still felt like I had stuff to work on in therapy if I chose to. And I didn't say this, but I am gradually more reconciled to the idea of finishing therapy at some point. It doesn't freak me out like it used to. I am ready to have a good end at some point. I don't want a therapy that is forced to end through circumstance, I want to be in control of the ending and it to be by our mutual choice. So that means we have to make that choice at some point.

heart-of-a-wildflower:

Don't wear tight/too small clothes - I know you want to cling to your tiny jeans but, as someone told me in inpatient 'they fit your eating disorder really well' - bin them, take them to charity, sell them, trust me it will feel better
Eat what YOU want - not what the eating disorder wants. Sure, some people in recovery post beautiful salads and smoothies and if you feel like that sometimes then enjoy it but if you want chocolate or McDonalds or a dounut, why not? It doesn't invalidate your illness or recovery or make you a bad person, it just means you are listening to yourself instead of the ED
Base your recovery/plans on YOU, not other recovery blogs - I've never made myself a calorie goal or meal plan in recovery, I've just based it on how I feel whilst being realistic about knowing how much I need to eat and when I'm hungy or full. If a meal plan works for you or your team have set it then that's great, if not, that's cool too
Don't weigh yourself. Seriously. For the love of happiness and nature and all things good, throw those damn scales away. It brings me to tears to think of the number of girls (and boys) defining their worth as people by that stupid F-ing number
Ask for all the help you need - it looks different for everyone, it could be going to your GP, private therapy, school counsellor, a helpline, or just friends and family. I've always found it easier feeling like those aroung you are fighting the illness too
Make sure you're not trading one behaviour for another. Its amazing if you haven't binged/purged/over-exercised/taken diet pills for however long but if you have replaced that with another behaviour or diet, becoming veggie or vegan, ask yourself is that healthy for you at the point in recovery you are in or is it fuelling your eating disorder?
Be immensely totally proud of yourself every single day and moment you choose recovery.

It's infuriating to see you keep using being busy (which hello, lots of people are and they still manage to eat) as an excuse not eat properly - and then to have the audacity to humblebrag about it on here where you know lots of your followers are probably anxious about eating too much or worrying they're not active enough.   Answer: Ah anon, calm down. I never said I was perfect. I'm trying to find the balance in life as much as the next person. Being busy does make it difficult to find time for proper meals and I'm sure I'm not the only person to feel that way. Sometimes eating lunch becomes grabbing a slice of fruit toast before a run, and a handful of cashews when I get back just as the baby is waking up from her nap, because I have to choose between going for a run in the sunshine or spending  minutes making and eating the sit-down lunch I would choose to have - because bizarre as this might seem to you, once up and awake the baby will not just sit for  minutes peacefully on her own with no demands of me.If there's any of my followers who are tracking my food and trying to emulate me, let me tell you that I had homemade macaroni and broccoli cheese and  slices of bacon for tea followed by a Cadbury's mini roll.

Tbh H and I don't have a lot of time together, and when we do have an hour or two, we're often too tired to do anything other than sit together in peaceful companionship - which in itself is lovely.But we're very committed to each other and I think our personalities lead towards a peaceful coexistence. Neither of us is prone to big arguments. H especially is very laid back and so even if I have a rant about something, he doesn't argue back.Before you have children, it's hard to imagine how little time you're going to have for yourself after they arrive, especially as they grow up! We try and give each other space to get out and do our own activities and social things. We appreciate each other and say thankyou for the little things. I would love us to be more emotionally intimate, but I also don't want to put the time and effort in and endure the uncomfortableness needed to achieve that, so we potter on as we are. It's a journey. We had children young and I'm hoping that as the girls grow up and leave home, that will be our time to rediscover our relationship and have our adventures just the two of us.Sorry I'm not sure I had any answers for you there!

you know how someone can tell you that you're smart, amazing, and beautiful  times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn't really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you're incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't share about my hard days too. i've mentioned that i've been struggling a bit lately, and if i'm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

*disclaimer: some opinions are helpful when they're from people you trust to tell you if you're going crazy, to push you if you need encouragement, and to keep you in check*

i know it's easier said than done to stop thinking about what you think you *should* be doing and start prioritizing what you want to be doing, so here are some practical things to remember:
‚ú®you will never be everyone's cup of tea, so stop trying. being your own is what matters most.
‚ú®when people have negative comments or even judgments to make, it's usually a reflection of them and not actually about you.  from what i've learned, the people who are negative about someone else who didn't do anything directly to them are usually struggling with or are insecure about something themselves.
‚ú®what's the worst case scenario? that someone *may* say something about you? is that really bad enough to hold you back from living a life that fulfills you and makes you happier?
‚ú®you only live once. i don't mean to be morbid, but we're all going to die eventually. in , , or  years from now, i hope you get to look back on your life without regrets and knowing that you chose to be true to yourself and happy.

sometimes i look in the mirror and feel confused. my reflection doesn't feel right. then i move to another mirror and see something different than the first. i repeat the process again and again until i don't know which to trust. 

sometimes i look in the mirror and love what i see. hours later, in a different mirror, i struggle to accept what stares back at me. the changes feel radical but rationally i know that's not possible. i know my body didn't change very much in a small window of time.

but that's what body dysmorphia can be. nothing feels consistent. nothing feels stable. trust is hard to come by. acceptance? even less frequent. i've learned that the less attention i give to this discomfort, the less power it has over me. the less time i spend staring in the mirror, or trying on outfits, or scrolling through photos of myself, the less space bad body image takes up in my mind. 

i'm not saying to pretend the bad body image isn't there. recognize it. say out loud, 'hey, this is hard. i'm uncomfortable. i'm not feeling great about myself'. you're allowed to feel these feelings. but we are not are feelings. they don't identify us. we have them, but we exist beyond them. there is comfort in realizing this.

the next step is what's crucial: either you let these feelings terrorize you, or you support your healing. i choose the latter by directing my focus elsewhere. i wear loose fitting clothing and call a friend. i pick up a book or go for a walk or i bake. i say, 'my body image doesn't feel grounded or secure, but i can find other things in my life that are'. and then i invest all of my being into these other things, these other things that make me feel better.

i know that i live with body dysmorphia. i know that this isn't something that simply goes away. but i know it doesn't define me. i know it's not my fault. i know i can find joy in my life beyond a reflection. so that's what i'm trying to do, every day. healing is lifelong, i think.

Doc ID: 2711, distribution: 0.7501980830189038 ; Restricting throughout the week & binging on the weekends was something I did pretty much my whole life... Until last year. 

Being healthy isn't eating only salads and spending hours in the gym all day throughout the week and then letting go and binging on the weekend. 

Being healthy means balancing the foods you know are good for your body with the foods you know are good for your soul, sanity and mind. It's moving your body in ways that you enjoy, not in ways that feel like punishment. 

Health and happiness go hand in hand. Eat the chocolate, eat the salad. Go to the gym, rest your body. Both are necessary. This is why I create the content I share both on IG and YouTube! Your body knows what it needs and what it doesn't, put your health and happiness first üå∏

Can you tell us more about the trial such as how you found out about it, how many people are in it, what you have to do, and more? Answer: Yes I'm involved in the Oxford vaccine trial. There were adverts out earlier in the year looking to recruit volunteers, that's how I found out about it, and I thought I could do my bit to try and help save the world - we don't get many chances to make a big difference like that. There's some thousands of people involved in it, in multiple countries. I've had a vaccine (and a second vaccine dose) which could be the COVID one or it could be a meningitis one (which they used as a control). I have to go back every few months for blood tests, and I have to do a COVID swab every week for the duration of the trial, which I think is a year. That's about it.

.
restoring my physical health, rekindling a healthy relationship with food, nursing my mind back to peace. these were big changes. these are what i call on when asked how recovery changed my life.
.
i tend to forget the little changes. how once i got better, that deep, icy chill in my bones disappeared. how sitting in chairs and laying in a bathtub became moments of rest, not of agonizing tailbone pain. how i've earned the right to close my bedroom door for privacy. my parents aren't worried im sneaking in a third workout because now, i'm probably just napping instead. resting...i can do that, finally. .
.
i tend to forget the small shifts. how my mom monitored my meals less and less frequently, until, without saying it, she trusted me to stop throwing my dinner away. how i could wake up late for school and grab a breakfast i didn't spend days planning in advance. all without thinking twice.
.
and of course, there was the simple fact that when my life got better, so did everyone else's. how my sisters no longer feared being in the kitchen with me. my family stopped walking on eggshells in my presence. these days, the only eggshells we deal with are the ones scooped out of a brownie batter that we enjoy together...me included.
.
when i was recovering i gauged my progress by how close i was to attaining the big changes. qualities that i thought determined my success. my treatment team weighed me weekly, but never asked, ‚Äúis it a little easier to look in the mirror today?‚Äù. this little hurdle took a jump, and it matters too. .
.
don't lose sight of your progress. so often we grow discouraged because we're not changing rapidly enough. what's one thing you can do today that would have destroyed you a week ago, a year ago? i'm proud of you for that.
.
because in the end, i have to ask: what do you think the big changes are made from anyway? all of the small ones, coming together, adding up...not so small after all, right?üí´

 on the topic of binge eating: binges, whether they are objectively identified or subjectively experienced as such, nearly always have an identifiable source, which can be broken down into  main ones: ) transgression of one's dietary rules, leading to a temporary abandoning of said rules; ) undereating, where binges stem from a physiological need that is not being met; ) substance use, where inhibitions are lifted and food rules become less rigid; and ) adverse mood or external event, where the binge acts as an emotional regulator to dampen the negative feelings produced by the event.¬† each of these can be a trigger for binge eating on their own, but can also interact with others. identifiying and analyzing the source of each binge is a necessary step to understand the process leading to it and, over time, will help in regaining control over binge urges.¬† source

Doc ID: 4804, distribution: 0.9474384587662473 ; I went to do a bank transfer to pay T for this week's session and discovered that I actually owe her for the last three sessions. Whoops. And ouch. Expensive. My mind must have been so full of the contents of the sessions that I totally forgot to pay. T does her accounts a month at a time so I'm sure she'd have been on to me in another week or so. Glad I could get all paid up though before she had to bring it to my attention.

Doc ID: 3816, distribution: 0.8956020431057635 ; Question: Are you managing to keep using therapy to work on the same things you were pre-pandemic? All I can think about is the virus and lockdown and how much it's impacting my mental health and I'm so mad about having to spend so much therapy time on it every single week but I can't think about or concentrate on anything else  Answer: No not really. Pre-pandemic we were deep into some work about my attachment style and my relationship with H. Then the pandemic came and completely threw me off for a few sessions. I had a full session when we tried to talk about H and I, and I couldn't focus at all and we just kept coming back to the virus. The week after that I asked T if we could just do a half session because I knew mentally I wasn't in a place to do therapy work, and it was mostly a check in. The week after that we did another half session, but we did get a bit deeper into stuff and it felt like we could have carried on for the full session. Then last week we did a full session again and we did do therapy but we didn't talk about the stuff we had been in the middle of pre-pandemic. That stuff felt a bit irrelevant in current cirucmstances. Instead we talked about some new stuff that came out of talking about my eating and intake.I'd say just go with what's on your mind, if that's the pandemic, then allow yourself to talk about that and process everything that's coming up. Maybe once you've let yourself do that you'll find that your mind starts to feel more open to discussing other things again.

Doc ID: 10672, distribution: 0.8137051860018152 ; Okay so, it's a new day, time to start fresh after my binging ramping tf up. Here's my plan: I've hit a plateau and my binging has become more frequent in the past ~ months. Of course quarantine has made it harder for me to lose weight as Im not going to school but I've had differences in my eating generally, if I focus on these I should get back on track - Healthy eating: I haven't been focusing on eating well as of late. Im pretty certain this has linked to my binges/higher eating as there are more foods I'm willing to eat (yet still eat low amounts of my fear foods which are healthy rip) and also not eating healthy makes me overall feel trashier - Sugar (links to healthy eating): I've stopped my complete ban on sugar and although I was able to keep it low I've slipped recently. It's not as filling and does not give me the satisfaction/contentness of non sugary foods (then there is the fact I always crave savory after a sweet food so more urges) - Snacking: Why did I ever think buying snack foods was a good idea? These aren't candy and some are even healthy but still, I now have access to food that I can instantly eat with no prep. It just adds so easily to my intake, sticking to mainly meals is better for me as it's harder to binge on entire meals the same way it is to binge on many snacks Im going to focus on them three and do some other stuff to get myself in line (which I won't mention as those are purely ed behaviors, I listed these as they are genuinely good for healthier eating and prevent binges can be detrimental to emotional and physical healthy, I'm serious about not being pro-ana or pro-ed)
