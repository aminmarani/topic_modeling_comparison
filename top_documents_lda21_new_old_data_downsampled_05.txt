Doc ID: 1693, distribution: 0.9566415758733161 ; whsprings:I can feel myself turning a corner. even just in the past week, my motivations have completely shifted from external to internal. this afternoon I had both urges and opportunity to act on behaviors, and then I realized I didnt want to act on them. Ive only ever wanted to do it. I have not accepted my body, but I also no longer find the prospect of slowly killing myself to achieve a body I deem more acceptable all that appealing. I no longer wish I was sicker. I finally see that recovery is a real and true possibility on the horizon and that I am fully capable of moving toward it. I never thought this day would come and Im tearing up just thinking about it. I truly did not believe recovery was possible for me and now my team has said they are seeing my blossom, I feel more like myself than I have in a year and a half, I have energy, I laugh, I can concentrate, I can stand and walk without seeing stars, I can feel the life returning to me and it feels fucking amazing. it has taken months of work and weeks of getting my ass handed to me but laureate has changed my life and I will forever be grateful to them because I am doing what I once believed impossible. I still have so much work to do but now I know I am capable of doing it. I know that there is hope. I know that I can do hard things despite the fear. I know that I can win this fight.

Here's two reasons…these states within our autonomic nervous system reside in our bodies where the language that is understood is the felt sense, not cognition or rational understanding. So I can tell myself “to focus on the positive” all I want but if that is not an embodied experience then it will not support my system in responding to it. It would sort of be like being on a phone call with someone who spoke a language you didn't understand, it would not compute. But if you were to be face to face with that person and could sense they were safe (this happens in an embodied nervous system to nervous system connection) by the way they smiled, their face and voice softened, etc. it would support your system in coming towards regulation. ⠀ All this is to say, if you haven't been able to “shift your mindset” by telling yourself to shift your mindset or focusing on positive thoughts, I want you to know that you aren't alone, that this  makes sense AND that there is a way to shift your experience. Through gently beginning to come into your embodied experience, learning how to process stored energy through, having disconfirming experiences and of course co-regulating and self-regulating. One brave, tolerable step at a time. ⠀ You make sense, my friend. I will always remind you of that.”

recipe: one chopped raw zucchini, cauliflower rice, frozen blueberries, a scoop of pumpkin, a spoon of stabilized rice bran, one scoop of @nuzest_usa rice chocolate protein (code: “healthful_radiance” ❗️❗️), half a large ripe avocado, and almond milk. my biggest smoothie tip is blending all the ingredients except the avocado first. then add it last and reblend. i'm not sure why but i find i always get the thickest texture doing this! i also use a ninja professional blender (bc i don't have a second life savings to drop on a vita mix 😀) and find it works really well!

brown rice and lentil pilaf with caramelized onions:
i made this on a whim but here's what went down! i sautéed an onion in olive oil until caramelized and placed to the side. then i added some pre-steamed brown rice and pre-cooked lentils to a pot with enough vegetable stock to cover. i brought this to a boil and then reduced heat to low and covered, stirring occasionally until the liquid was all absorbed! at the end i drizzled in some balsamic vinegar, more sea salt, and threw the onions on top! .

Exercise  // Yoga ball sit-ups //  minute
Slow and controlled sit-ups are much more effective that those that are super quick and poorly done. If you're doing them correctly, you might even start to shake when you are contracting at the top of the sit-up!
Exercise  // V-sits with or without a kg weight //  reps
I find these super difficult (watch my face at the end 😂), especially because you have to stay balanced! But the aim is to twist as far round to each side as possible. Focussing on the weight or your hands as you twist really helps. 
Exercise  // Plank // Hold for  minute
Make sure your arms are forming a right angle and if you place your palms facing upwards, you should hold less tension around your neck and upper body. 
Exercise  // Plank toe taps and dips //  seconds each exercise
Don't let your lower back collapse and keep your abs as tight as possible.
Exercise  // V-sits //  minute
The aim is to extend and pause to hold for a second, and then crunch inwards, again holding the contraction at the top for a split second. Balance is again key to this one!
Exercise  // Side plank with variations // Hold each side for  seconds,  dips each side,  seconds leg hold each side
Throughout this whole sequence, keep thinking about trying to lift your hips up as far away from the ground as possible. 
Repeat the whole workout  times 💪🏻

So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don't know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I've mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These  exercise I did for  minute each, and repeated the whole circuit  times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise  // Lat pull down //  minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise  // Seated chest fly //  minute

-
This cool down stretch sequence takes not more than  minutes and I do it without fail after every single workout! Hold each stretch for as long as you need, but I normally do each for anywhere between  seconds to a minute 😊
-
Stretching out not only helps to increase your flexibility, but it also prevents injuries, soothes muscle soreness and means you can go all out again when you next workout 🏃🏻‍♀️
-
I've grown up dancing so stretching has always been a big part of my life, but don't worry if you feel quite tight at the start. You'll definitely notice your body loosening up as you do this regularly! ✨

chickpea and eggplant ratatouille:

sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep. if roasting right now that's fine! toss with oil and salt and roast at  for a half hour, they'll cook more once you add them to the pot after roasting). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about  minutes with stirring every / minutes). that's it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those  minutes just to thicken a touch more.

Doc ID: 8967, distribution: 0.7260787628534848 ; The steps to becoming a registered dietitian:

- complete a bachelor's (or master's degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January , , a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an “Internship.” some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete  hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration's registration exam
- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. / of the United States require licensure to practice. 
- maintain continuing education -  hours every  years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the “nutritionist” title isn't regulated so there's no guarantee of the experience and education that they've had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients —and to the world. good (i say this because i can't blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

in case you missed my last pesto crusted post, here's another sign to start making all of your sandwiches this way. in my silly little opinion, crusty, warm, and flavorful bread will elevate just about any dish hahaha. the easiest hack to enhance your meals!

roasted veggie & goat cheese pesto crusted sandwich 

toast two slices of sourdough to your liking, then spread/layer on the following:

- smashed avocado 
- crumbled goat cheese (can easily sub a crumbled vegan cheese here)
- a dollop of basil pesto
- roasted red bell peppers
- arugula

sandwich the pieces together, brush both sides with pesto (!!), cook on the stovetop for - min on each side or until crispy and fragarent. slice and enjoy!

- / cup oats
- / cup coconut flour
- / cup peanut butter
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup pumpkin puree 
- sea salt
- cinnamon
- nutmeg
- pumpkin pie spice

blend everything in a food processed and roll into balls. if the batter is too runny add more coconut flour until the dough is sticky and thick. place in the freezer for a few minutes to set!

curried tahini tray bake:

this was sooooo easy. all i did was toss zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, onions, chickpeas, and baby kale in sea salt, curry powder, and olive oil. spread the veggies on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and roast at  for about  minutes. once veggies are browned stir through over tahini dressing ( tbsp tahini,  tbsp warm water, garlic powder, sea salt) and bake again for another  minutes. i love packing this for lunch paired with roasted potatoes and avocado!

Having your weight taken at the doctor's office can create unnecessary weight-based stress and healthcare avoidance, when in many situations, it's not even necessary to be weighed during a routine visit with your primary care physician in the first place. 

Please know that you deserve a safe space to have an open conversation about weight with your doctor. Your boundaries, your voice, and your needs matter.

creamy vegan pasta:

start by filling a stovetop pot with water and bringing to a boil. in a separate pot, heat a hearty drizzle of olive oil, then add  chopped yellow onion and  diced clove of garlic. season with sea salt and cook for a few minutes until browned and fragrant. add in  cup of tomato puree and / cup of full fat coconut milk. cook on medium heat with frequent stirring for about  minutes. while that's cooking cook your spaghetti of choice according to package instructions (minus  minute). drain the cooked pasta and add it to the pot with the sauce. stir until the pasta is evenly coated and remove from heat. plate, season, and serve!

EVEN THOUGH the thought of eating something completely different, like bread or scrambled eggs, still makes me go mad. but this is not the actually worrying point … it all comes together in the late afternoon/evening. lunch is mostly fine and i might have a snack as well, from there on it's a damn struggle sometimes. i mean, some days i'll go on and it's okay, but on bad days i just literally can't stop myself from using behaviours. when i overeat just a little i can handle it, but when i feel really physically full or even completely stuffed, there is no way i can keep it inside. it seems to be impossible, guilt and fear are way too strong.  i know i should just let it happen, trust my body but i feel so lost and disconnected very frustrated about this having happened again, purging is so so unhealthy and dangerous, i'm scared because i might fuck up my toilet every time (close call today), it's disgusting and i really really need to stop tomorrow i am going to have breakfast as usual and think about ways to prevent this from happening … maybe i do need to eat more during the day, even though i feel like i am already eating a lot

Doc ID: 7618, distribution: 0.7686259858272666 ; last night i received a DM expressing that i was a role model.
.
.
it made me think. .
.
i have three younger sisters. i'm the oldest of four. naturally my place calls for setting an example. paving a path. leading the way.
.
.
when i was sick and dying from my eating disorder i provided none of these things for my sisters. we're close in age, only six years between me and the youngest. the years i spent sick were formative years for all of us. years when they each needed me the most.
.
.
but i wasn't there.
.
.
they watched their older sister lock herself in her room and exercise until she blacked out. they watched their older sister throw bowls of oatmeal at their mom and run away from the table. they understood that, “angie isn't well”, but did they? did they actually understand? when they had questions about boys and makeup and high school, they had to call a hospital phone line where their older sister was living in an eating disorder unit because she was afraid of toast.
.
.
i had an eating disorder, but it wasn't mine alone. my entire family suffered. i was supposed to be a role model to these incredible young women. i was supposed to experience the world and then report back, yes do this, no don't do that. i was supposed to show them bravery and strength, maturity and grace.
.
.
instead i hurt them. i snapped at them, refused to eat around them, barely looked at them. they were deathly afraid of me. rightfully so. i was a monster.
.
.
that was nearly six years ago. i've grown since then. in my newfound health i've mended my relationships with my siblings. i could have never saved myself without the love they provided when i deserved it the least. my deepest hope is that i can finally be a role model for them again.
.
.
reading this DM made me cry. many moons ago i loathed myself for my inability to provide an example. and now? now i hope things are different. .
.
recovery is worth it. .
.
girlies...i love you to the end of the earth. i'm here for you. i'm staying this time ♥️

.
there are tangible triggers that bring back an eating disorder memory. objects and smells and even the weather. i'll see one and think nothing at all and then, boom, a memory, a moment, planted in my brain. it doesn't stay long. there are no roots, but there are leaves, and they blow around for a moment or two.
.
i picked up my sister at a friend's yesterday. she lives down the street from the local hospital, the same one i lived in for months. .
at a red light i wait to turn left; a blue sign indicates the hospital to the right. for a moment everything is black. i feel my moms arms squeezing me, the way she did in the backseat  years ago when my parents lied to me. told me we were driving to school. brought me to the hospital instead.
.
in that moment i'm no longer in the driver's seat. my dad's there instead, nearly running red lights to get me to treatment faster. as if that would make a difference. i feel old hunger pains rattling my ribs. suddenly my wrists hurt. i remember clawing at them that day.
.
the light turns red and i snap back, pull onto the nearest street, park my car. let the memory come up and play out. let the tears come. i only took a few minutes, but i sit with the memory of a traumatizing past instead of repressing it. my tactic for years.
.
it feels so good to cry. i'm too busy feeling to think and my mind is light and my heart is heavy and it's cathartic. it's everything i didn't know i needed until it fell right into my lap. i didn't know i was ready.
.
for so long i avoided “triggers” because i wasn't ready to face them. they'd hurt me, and i couldn't be kicked down when i was barely standing up. this is okay, and it's normal, and it's important to work through. .
.

but time heals. and i'm finally in a place where i can grow through these moments. there was pain, but there was acceptance. .
.

when i allowed myself to feel the pain, there was release. it wasn't bottled up anymore. i had opened the jar and poured it down the sink, watched the stream swirl the drain, took it all in, and then let it all go somewhere far beyond myself. .

growing pains, am i right?

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.6739378103108385 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

cut one large sweet potato into thick chunks. line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set oven to . toss the potato chunks in a generous (don't hold back!) drizzle of olive oil. don't add salt! make sure each chunk is well coated all around. i make sure to handle each chunk individually because i care way too much but you know, whatever it takes. make sure they're all evenly spread out and roast for  minutes, flipping halfway. when you're ready to serve, toss with a generous amount of salt (i've found salting at the end instead of the beginning keeps them extra moist get it.

of my own self-hatred
from the dark days of destruction.

and feel it expand and collapse
with each influx of breath.
a moment of silence please,
for this was the site of a great battle
grave battle
that night when I prayed to the universe almighty
that the rise and fall of that chest would end
when I swallowed those pills
and closed my eyes to the world
oh,
but if we keep going,
there
below it, there, to the left
my barely beating heart
pain-soaked, world-weary heart,
beats on
carrying this body of wounded history through the world.

How many of you were sucking in while seeing this? Leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments if you were!

If you're anything like me then you've probably been sucking your belly in for most of your life. Well, if you need it, here's your permission to just breathe & let your body be. 

We all have ✨ extra padding ✨ to protect our vital organs, keep us warm, keep our hormones regulating, our minds happy & our bodies healthy!!!

This is me before I've had brekky in the morning. My body expands & changes a lot over the course of a single day, let alone across the year(s), just like all of us. 

If we base our happiness & self worth on something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll always be on the rollercoaster of self-doubt & shame.

You don't have to have a flat tummy… in fact, the idea that a woman must have a “flat tummy” to be beautiful & healthy is setting us all up for failure. The terms “tummy pooch” “lower belly bump” “fat rolls” etc are used in such negative ways but it's literally such a normal part of the human body that MOST of us will have & never be rid of — no matter how much we k*ll ourselves in the kitchen OR in the gym. 

Here's your sign to appreciate your body for what it does for you more! It doesn't matter whether you have a big belly, a belly of loose skin, a belly covered in stretch marks, or a small belly, all bellies are cute 🫶

Today I planned to do something that feels good, tastes good, challenges me and scares me. In that order. *I saved the best part of the date for last* 😮‍💨💀😅 [ad]

st stop — FEELS GOOD: move my body, because it's a blessing I'm grateful for every day! (except for the wardrobe malfunction lol 🙊)

nd stop — TASTES GOOD: refuel with sushi & a good read

rd stop — CHALLENGES ME: find my way through an optical illusion maze 😳

th stop — SCARES ME: catapult myself above all of the tallest buildings on the Gold Coast at kms per hour… on my own 🥲

If you had to take yourself on a date that feels good, tastes good, challenges you & scares you, what would you do??? It's fun, promise! 🏋🏻‍♀️🍣🤹‍♀️🎭🎢🎡

I know the idea of taking yourself on a solo adventure might sound weird or scary, but you gain strength, courage and confidence with every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.

these points apply to our roles as conscious consumers online. one of the luxuries of controlling our own social media presence and landscape is that we can follow and un follow new accounts any time we want to- nothing is binding! immerse yourself in spaces that make you feel supported, whole, and seen. ones that contribute to a strong headspace, ones that give you hope for goals you're working toward and a sense of gratitude for ones you've accomplished. 

in light of both the DM (second slide) i received recently and the stories i shared yesterday about food mongering (slides -), i was reminded that social media can be toxic. but i know firsthand it can also be positive and powerful. the way we choose to use this tool is up to us. we can continue following and exposing ourselves to content that is harmful to us because we're conditioned to believe it's healthy. OR we can act on behalf of our own healing journeys and cultivate a space where we can grow. oh, and we can call out BS when we see it (hi health coaches with no credentials 👋)!

if you follow accounts that make you feel bad— stop. if you follow accounts that trigger harmful thoughts or behaviors— stop. in order to use online communities to heal, grow, and improve ourselves, we must be conscious consumers. it's okay to walk away in the name of self-love. in fact, i highly, highly recommend it xxxxx

in a separate bowl mix the dry ingredients:
-  / cups oat flour
- / cup gluten-free oats
- / cup quinoa flour
- pinch of baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

add dry mixture to wet and stir to combine. pour into loaf pan and bake for about - minutes. let cool completely before icing. for the icing i just blended cashews (soaked overnight), maple syrup, vanilla, full fat coconut milk, splash of lemon juice…didn't measure this time around but you can play around with proportions based on desired texture!

oats soaked overnight and cooked in almond milk, sea salt, cinnamon, and ground flax. added protein powder at the end and topped with peanut butter, vegan greek yogurt, banana, blueberries, and cacao nibs

self-love is recognizing and affirming yourself for who you really are.

self-love is accepting yourself however you show up on any given day.

self-love is honoring yourself and your body even when you don't feel good.

self-love is being honest with yourself about where you're at and what is really best for you.

self-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.

self-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.

self-love is knowing that your worth doesn't change even when you do.

self-love is freedom, and being free is the best feeling in the world.

so, let go of control and expectations because you simply can't control other people in general—you can only control you.  sometimes, the only thing you can control is your effort and your attitude, and if you recognize that, then you can put your energy into those things and be more effective.

even though there's a lot of noise and chaos and distraction in the world, you are in control of your life, and you are capable of manifesting the life you want. look inwards for validation and understanding rather than outwards, allow yourself to surrender to the universe, and trust that your message has been delivered.  things will start to fall into place, promise.

 it is :am currently, and i am so terrified i will not mention numbers of any kind and i will not use tags, just have to put all these fears somewhere, i guess. if you are easily triggered, please refrain from reading this at all 
 ——– 
 who am i even kidding? myself? i have relapsed and i'm not fucking getting out of the spiral my body looks horrible i do not mean this in a “i am ugly” way, more like “i am terrified because of what i let happen to my body”. for reference, as i was moving further in recovery, i was decently strong and had muscle, but also fat, it was good. now? i look like bones with skin and fat. rock climbing was my passion, now i am too weak and exhausted to really want it even, hello being malnourished, yeah. my ass, that was round and good? gone. my bras are loose. sex drive? it was low, nonexistant is what fits now. i don't want to eat most of the time, just don't care fuck  i want to eat i want to feel healthy again i want to cook actually diverse meals and eat them 
 why is it that i just fucking can't i know i'm destroying myself, i hate how it feels, i hate how my body looks now more than ever, i hate the anxiety and I KNOW the only cure is eating not exercising, not anything I KNOW but the minute i actually do it, i panic i'm not undereating by so much, i think, but i am i keep losing, after all, which i don't even want but also do want does it make sense? not really, i know i know i know. i just have to eat. no exercise. only food and more food. it all is so fucking terrifying and i don't know what to do. oh god i just don't know. how did this happen? i don't want to burden anyone, don't want to let them know i am relapsing. have to get a grip before it gets truly bad. nobody should worry and i should be fine the thing is, i am even trying  adding fear foods, telling myself to eat. blocking anyone with ED content. when i see it, the content of people who are trying to starve themselves more, i just feel so very bad for them - it does not trigger me anymore, though. quite the opposite, it all disgusts me so much. th*nspo, pills, whatever IT DISGUSTS ME. yet i cannot fucking bring myself to nourish my body like a grownass person. yet i start shaking on my whole body as i open the fridge on bad days, knowing i have to make a meal and doing it, but so terrified. sometimes i cry through meals. why? oh why. my lord i don't even want to be thin, it is all about control, right? i don't like it. AT THE SAME TIME i feel massive and too big. the ED logic, i know, so no logic at all i have to sleep but i fucking can't because i keep drinking too much coffee at work and because i am so so scared and i don't know where to put myself or what to do my legs were purple i freeze constantly just want to never leave my bed again, never think about food or having to eat it. i remember how it used to fascinate me and i kept looking at images and videos of food because i was so starved. now i would not bother. mostly, i force food down my throat. sometimes with tears, sometimes annoyance. sometimes i eat like a sloth because i can't do it faster, sometimes i just shove it in so it is over 
 it all hurts and i am scared and alone

If you spend your recovery making those cute stereotypical Recovery Warrior meals for Instagram, thats cute and all, but youre still micromanaging your meals. Thats not recovery. You cant rely on having magical healthy and nutritional perfect recovery meals. You just cant. Thats fucking dumb. Non disordered people dont do that. Yes enjoy fruits and veggies.But yes enjoy sugars and carbs. I developed a strong sweet tooth in my recovery. Would I have chosen that? No. But its not my job to micromanage that.

I don't know if it's helpful to keep focusing on food and recovery stories, or if I should be trying to redirect my attention to literally anything else to “rewire my brain”, but regardless it's an interesting read.

Just to piggy back on this cool post, in my experience I couldnt even see an eating disorder specialist and receive my diagnosis until after I fixed my other issues in therapy The Ed doctors wouldnt even acknowledge me until I had worked through my other illnesses. That really made me feel like I wasnt sick enough to be taken seriously. I bet a few of you have dealt with the same. Thing is, when getting help, (in my area at least) my problems were put in a straight line. I approach them one at a time before moving on to the next. My Ed was just further down the line of problems. Instead of being ganged up on by every mental health treatment all at once, they made me do one at a time. My outsides were not as sick as my insides, but I still deserved to be taken seriously by professionals. I deserved to be taken seriously by other EdHeads and I deserved to be taken seriously by myself. I was sick. I was sick for years. I was diagnosed later. But thats okay.If none of us were ever actually sick because of lack of diagnosis, we wouldnt even be on this side of Tumblr, now would we. Normies dont participate on this side of Tumblr. Hate to break it to you. We sick.
