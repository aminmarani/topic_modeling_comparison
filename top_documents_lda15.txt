ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

Doc ID: 2374, distribution: 0.8567726238143618 ; The reality of wearing a tight bodycon dress (& being human) 🤷🏻‍♀️

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

🌟 Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
🌟 Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
🌟 LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world 🥹 I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same… Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
🌟 Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
🌟 Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you… 
🌟 If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key 🥰
🌟 At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us 💅 It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible 🫶

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks 💗

Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

All that keeps going round in my head is the end of the session, when I shut down and T asked “Are you angry with me?” and I told her I was. Then she said that we were right at the end of the session, and did I want to wind down for five minutes or just leave it there? I was feeling so mad and I didn't want to engage any more, but I knew if I left the session in this state I would probably feel worse over this coming week than if we at least did a bit of grounding now, so I reluctantly agreed to keep going. There was a lot of internal resistance and I really didn't want to talk to T about the surface-level things she started trying to make conversation with me over. For the last few minutes, I let her do most of the talking till time was up. She tried to get in some supportive stuff and building up “I'm on your side” kind of things. Then we said goodbye. I was still mad but at least we had a bit of wrapping-up to contain the mad until next session.

How did you know it was a good fit with your current therapist Answer: I had no idea about therapists being a good fit when I started therapy tbh. I didn't know it was a Thing. I'd never seen a therapist before and I knew nothing about therapy and was terrified about the whole process. I was only there because my friends dragged me there. It didn't even cross my mind that there might be options of other therapists. As far as I was concerned, it was this therapist or die trying.Having said that, now I know more! It's very understandable to be apprehensive and scared before meeting a new therapist. It takes time to feel comfortable with someone, so don't be disappointed if you don't “feel it” straight away. Give it a few sessions and try and keep an open mind. Think about what you want from therapy and whether you feel you can work on that with this therapist. I hope your first meeting goes well!

We need to think about your boundaries and that it's ok to have them” I don't think we need to come back to it. I don't want to use my therapy session to trouble shoot this issue. It's not a boundary issue that's bothering me, I'm happy to set my boundaries with the birth parents and to check that out with my supervisor. It's more about projecting how I felt onto how T feels. T asked me if I came to therapy today planning to say all this - “Was this what you wanted to talk about, or did it just come up?” I said it kind of just came up. T repeated that it was important and that it was about boundaries and about what the limits of my role are. After the session, I thought that my role with the birth parents is quite different to my therapist's role with me. So maybe the way my feelings respond to their messages are different to how T feels in response to my messages.

Doc ID: 16376, distribution: 0.9766286154058463 ; I texted T that quote I posted yesterday and said omg it's me. She replied “yes, it is you… but you're learning that your feelings are valid now” I first came across the quote as I was looking something else up in the book, and it really reminded me of how things were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet looking calm on the outside. That is definitely a thing I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It's strange to think it's not normal actually. Doesn't everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone's brain works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else's. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that's probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I've never really spoken about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was “quite avoidant” when it came up in conversation over something, but that's about it. Of course it's been referred to in the context of my responses to other things, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever therapists do when they figure out the theory of what's going on with their clients. I think it's perhaps something to talk about a bit more next session,

Doc ID: 15248, distribution: 0.9765373106820981 ; Question: What do you consider ruptures in therapy? How often do you see your therapist? How long have you been in counseling? Answer: I see her once a week and I've been seeing her for  years now. A rupture is something that the therapist does that gets in the way of the therapy work progressing. It usually means she's misattuned to me in some way. Sometimes it's a small thing that's quite easily repaired and sometimes it's a bigger thing that takes more work to resolve. Ruptures and repairs are actually quite an important part of therapy, and also something that is a natural part of it because nobody is going to be % attuned all the time.

T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
——
we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

maybe you've struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here's what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don't have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don't show up % for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can't do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else's emotions (whew! that's a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

when in your life has your “no” served you? share below!

the past  months have been some of the hardest yet also happiest months of my life. i've experienced a lot of change, fear, resistance, and self-doubt, but with those, i can look back and see that i've also grown tremendously.  i've practiced courage and now know my strength,  learned more about what my own needs are and set boundaries accordingly, developed appreciation for the journey, chosen to love myself more than ever despite *noise* telling me i'm not worthy enough, and created a sense of peace within me that i've never had before because i trust that even in the waiting, the not knowing, and the crazy that everything will be okay

 This is for the lonely souls out there - I see you, I hear you, I feel you. Whether you are phsysically alone right now or feeling lonely even though you are surrounded by people, I understand you. It is hard when you think that there is no one who listens, no one who cares, no one who wants to walk the path with you. It is hard when you think you are the only one who feels this way, the only one who is hurting, the only one who has to go through this. You might feel lonely, but you are not alone. We all feel this way from time to time, which is why it is important to share your thoughts and emotions. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your partner, tell your pet, tell strangers on the internet, just tell anyone. Because people care, they can relate and they will be there. You are never as lonely as you think you are, darling. You have supporters, you have me and most importantly you have yourself (yes, please do not underestimate the power of being your own best friend as well!).

i thought there was a “correct” way to go through life because i was given guidelines by society and the people around me when the truth is, there is no “correct” way to go through a life that solely belongs to you.

you are the main character of your life, and you only live this life once. no matter how you live it, people will judge you and try to change you, but if you ignore your intuition and allow them to alter your path, you're going to end up being a distorted version of yourself living somebody else's life. your authentic self is so much more powerful than any other version of you, and finding your way back to yourself is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding journeys of your lifetime.
