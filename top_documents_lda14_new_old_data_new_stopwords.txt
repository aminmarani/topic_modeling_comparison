Doc ID: 4335, distribution: 0.9925171020587444 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 4872, distribution: 0.9923625708998108 ; Therapy .. // rupture // part   I'm sorry this therapy session account is getting soooo long. It feels like it was a fairly massive session and there's so many bits of it I need to process and want to remember. T said “I'm really glad you've been able to talk about all this now. I wonder what stopped you bringing it up last session?”  Oh my goodness! Is she kidding me? I tried and tried to redirect her last session and explain what I needed and say that we had gone off track about what I wanted to talk about, but it was like she was on a completely different plane. “I TRIED!!” I said agitatedly. “You said we are going round in circles, but I didn't feel like I was going round in circles. I kept trying to explain things but I was like you were just going round and round in a little circle and I couldn't get you to break out of it!” “I'm so sorry about that,” T said, “I'm sorry I wasn't tracking you and I missed how you were feeling.” She has spent a lot of this session apologising. I appreciate that she is taking responsibility but I feel uncomfortable with putting her “in the wrong” and making her feel bad. Hello Faith who likes to take all the discomfort on herself to make everyone else feel better. I like what she said about tracking me though. I'm not really sure what that means in practical terms, like is it a thing therapists think about? But anyway whatever it is, I liked the thought that it was something she usually did. And usually gets right. She carried on, “I could tell something wasn't working and that's why I put a stop to it.” That was when she firmly moved the conversation on last week to another topic. I knew she had done it at the time and I allowed myself to be taken along with it and to leave the first half of the session behind. There was no guarantee we would have got anywhere if we'd spend another  minutes talking about the same thing so it was a good move to salvage some of the session and use it for something useful.

Doc ID: 4125, distribution: 0.9888235074412457 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

Doc ID: 3120, distribution: 0.9863480844178489 ; I haven't had time to stop and process (journal) Tuesday's therapy session yet. All that keeps going round in my head is the end of the session, when I shut down and T asked “Are you angry with me?” and I told her I was. Then she said that we were right at the end of the session, and did I want to wind down for five minutes or just leave it there? I was feeling so mad and I didn't want to engage any more, but I knew if I left the session in this state I would probably feel worse over this coming week than if we at least did a bit of grounding now, so I reluctantly agreed to keep going. There was a lot of internal resistance and I really didn't want to talk to T about the surface-level things she started trying to make conversation with me over. For the last few minutes, I let her do most of the talking till time was up. She tried to get in some supportive stuff and building up “I'm on your side” kind of things. Then we said goodbye. I was still mad but at least we had a bit of wrapping-up to contain the mad until next session. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3290, distribution: 0.9850699016979706 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4531, distribution: 0.9844325554956241 ; I emailed T my story. She read it straight away and replied that it was a really good story and she liked the name I had given the heroine. (There isn't much heroic about her imho but I get it's just what you call it) Then she said that the story feels unfinished and she wants to know what happened next…but no rush to write the next instalment. (There isn't another instalment) I guess we'll talk about it next therapy session. I think last session when T said what she said, it made little Faith think that T is on her side and be finally able to trust T enough to speak up. I don't know but that's what it feels like. When I read the story, I think yep that sounds pretty messed up. Yet if I try and think about the story in context of me, I think ehhh it was just how it was. Reading in black and white the facts as I remember them, I can see loads of reasons why I might have developed an eating disorder (or indeed any other coping strategy for anxiety) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2425, distribution: 0.9844325554956241 ; Question: I feel like it would be helpful to write a 'fictional' story about surviving being abused when I was a lot younger to process a lot that happened while maybe being able to disconnect myself from it. I don't want it to become a thing that makes me spiral as it's all dragged up again and my therapist isn't sure that it's a good idea right now but I think it's helpful? Do you think it's a good idea? Have you found writing things down helpful ever? Your blog helps me a lot, Faith so thank you! X  Answer: Hmm I don't know. I feel like I'm not really well-placed to advise you on this anon, since you and your therapist both know yourself much better than I do. If you do decide to write it, I'd take it steady and monitor your feelings, and if it starts to stir up a lot of feelings then take a break or pause. I usually do find writing things down helpful but that's just me. Thanks for your message 😊 xx

Doc ID: 3716, distribution: 0.9837484695957572 ; Therapy ..  [ minutes to go] …. but I think this is important, I think we need to come back to it. We need to think about your boundaries and that it's ok to have them” I don't think we need to come back to it. I don't want to use my therapy session to trouble shoot this issue. It's not a boundary issue that's bothering me, I'm happy to set my boundaries with the birth parents and to check that out with my supervisor. It's more about projecting how I felt onto how T feels. T asked me if I came to therapy today planning to say all this - “Was this what you wanted to talk about, or did it just come up?” I said it kind of just came up. T repeated that it was important and that it was about boundaries and about what the limits of my role are. After the session, I thought that my role with the birth parents is quite different to my therapist's role with me. So maybe the way my feelings respond to their messages are different to how T feels in response to my messages. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4719, distribution: 0.9837484695957572 ; Question: I know youve found a therapist, but I was just wondering - Have you considered taking D to the GP for a referral to CAMHS? Obviously there would be a waiting list and some CAMHS services are a lot better than others... but it sounds like she might need more input from a whole team with a psychiatrist etc and the option for a higher level of care if needed.  Answer: Hi and thanks. Yes, that's on my radar as a possible next step. Things have just escalated quite fast over the last couple of weeks, and the adoption is exacerbating everything too. So I think I will see how things go with the therapist, see if emotions settle down a bit after the baby has moved, and after a week off school with the half term holiday. Then if things are still bad, we will go to the GP. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4845, distribution: 0.9824641634805207 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Doc ID: 6845, distribution: 0.9860107128536151 ; my favorite fall savory meal. so versatile, can be served hot or cold, and packs so much flavor 🍂

fall harvest kale salad

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
-  apples of choice, diced (i used envy apples)
-  can of chickpeas (oz), rinsed and drained
- / cup vegan feta cheese

maple djion vinaigrette:

-  tbsp dijon mustard
- - tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup      
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the vinaigrette over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

Topic 3 : 
top terms: life, love, feel, things, people, time, want, way, even, take
Doc ID: 8653, distribution: 0.9906240948246805 ; Maybe you're tired of living the same day all over again

Maybe you're tired of scrolling seeing other people doing the thing you want to do

Maybe you're tired of feeling like you'll never get to do the things you want because of your situation

The difference between you right now & the people you strive to be like, or your dream vision “you” is that…

You're still in your comfort zone.

You've let the small things keep you here, rather than throw them right back and move forward with your beautiful gentle power.

Getting to a new, more exciting place requires stepping out and trusting yourself. 

I've coached women through leaving their job, starting a new venture, finally taking the trainings they have been too scared to take, traveling the world for their heart's sake, and actually pausing everything to do the RESTING that their bodies have craved.

So here's to trusting yourself, trusting yourself to get up, brush yourself off, and to keep moving. 

_______

My -month coaching program, Flourish with Purpose is where women who feel stuck and unfulfilled in their job/path come to: 

🔥reignite their flame 
🌏learn how they can uniquely make an impact on the world
⭐️gain confidence & support to pursue their dreams
💅🏼live life on their own terms

I'm only taking a few clients at a time.

🔗in my b for the application or send me a DM with any questions about it! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8721, distribution: 0.987875197478183 ; if you have been feeling stuck, start with figuring out these three things (completely free exercises!): 

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
——
we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

Doc ID: 8717, distribution: 0.9850745954334305 ;  reasons to step into your best self:

- the more you see yourself as amazing, you can create THAT much more amazing things for the world!

- when you see yourself as amazing as you are, it's easier to see the beauty in others!

- you may use your work / service as a way to “earn” status & favor which can be really draining and may feel inauthentic

stop playing small. be yourself. you're amazing. 
thank you, i love you!

if want support on stepping out of your minimized self, i help women do just that!

 This is for the lonely souls out there - I see you, I hear you, I feel you. Whether you are phsysically alone right now or feeling lonely even though you are surrounded by people, I understand you. It is hard when you think that there is no one who listens, no one who cares, no one who wants to walk the path with you. It is hard when you think you are the only one who feels this way, the only one who is hurting, the only one who has to go through this. You might feel lonely, but you are not alone. We all feel this way from time to time, which is why it is important to share your thoughts and emotions. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your partner, tell your pet, tell strangers on the internet, just tell anyone. Because people care, they can relate and they will be there. You are never as lonely as you think you are, darling. You have supporters, you have me and most importantly you have yourself (yes, please do not underestimate the power of being your own best friend as well!).

including these sunnies (from target.  i lose &break them too much to invest) 

for a long time i carried the idea that it's safer to keep my opinions and interests soft because “they” might judge me

(who is “they” anyway??)

however, my passions and my purpose can't be of service to anyone if i'm scared of failure or of judgement. maybe posting here like it's  will give you the permission to post whatever the f*ck you want, too. and maybe we'll all feel a little more empowered in this social media world. but we won't know unless i post the damn pictures and share my damn obsessions 🤟😌

long story short, love what you love and share what lights you up.

if youre looking for support with that, send me a DM! 🕊

relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

even if you're not where you want to be, look at how far you've come!! i'm so proud of you, and if you need the reminder: each moment is another chance at a new beginning, and it's never too late to choose yourself 🌷 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9702, distribution: 0.9819472020542822 ; self-love doesn't mean that you always feel good about yourself.

self-love is recognizing and affirming yourself for who you really are.

self-love is accepting yourself however you show up on any given day.

self-love is honoring yourself and your body even when you don't feel good.

self-love is being honest with yourself about where you're at and what is really best for you.

self-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.

self-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.

self-love is knowing that your worth doesn't change even when you do.

self-love is freedom, and being free is the best feeling in the world.

YOU have to decide that you're enough. you have to be honest with yourself.  you have to choose to see the good. you have to show up for you. you have to put in the WORK to grow and to create your happiness.
——
you are so worthy, and you are more than enough, but knowing and really believing in your self-worth and being as happy as you deserve is an inside job. i don't always have it all together, but in this season of trials for me, i am choosing to keep moving forward. sending you all love and light on your journeys, xoxo 🤍✨

vanilla matcha cake 🍵🍰

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

but, food is also just food.

it's okay if you eat past fullness sometimes. it's okay if you ate something that made you gassy and bloated. it's okay if you eat something that doesn't satisfy you. it's okay if your eating isn't your idea of “perfect”.

there are so many valid reasons to eat other than “for fuel”including not having a clear reason at all. food doesn't have to have so much power over you, and there are SO many more important things in life to focus on and experience because at the end of the day, food is just food, and each individual food choice you make doesn't need to be so complicated.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful.

Doc ID: 2392, distribution: 0.9078075671844428 ; You will never ✨actually✨ see your own body. You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

Doc ID: 2321, distribution: 0.8882695962011795 ; You've only ever seen yourself in your reflection, photos or videos. You will never see yourself the way other people do, because your reflection is not you🪞 

You could be told everyday how beautiful you are by those around you, but you'll never see, believe or feel it unless you start viewing yourself for everything else that you are… because all the things that make you beautiful aren't found in the way that you look. You aren't your best or worst photo. You aren't your body or looks.

You are the warmth people feel when they see you laugh or smile, you are the kindness you show others, you are beautiful because of your story, your challenges, your strength, your ability to make others feel safe/seen/heard, the way that you light up when you're doing what you love, the confidence you have when you wear the clothes that make you feel good, the way you inspire others by owning your “flaws” & just being yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it when it's the least important thing about you. If you could be outside of your own eyes for a day, I think you'd see how much more you have to offer yourself & the world than the way your flesh sack looks. Please don't give it more power than all the light you have to shine ✨

(I post this weekly series to share what would've helped me when I was struggling with my body image, food & online comparison. I share these for my younger self, who felt a need to edit my photos to look a certain way online. There is nothing wrong with the left OR the right. Both are human, both are me, minutes apart. While I can't represent all bodies, I CAN showcase my reality & be part of the change I wish to see in the world. I hope to encourage you to be a lil kinder to yourself & live a life uncontrolled by the way that you look)🌷

As you guys already know, each week I post the posed, tensed, IG-worthy photos of myself beside the real, unposed, in-between snapshots! And this week we'll still be doing that, but this time it's going to be purely focused on showing you just HOW MUCH a lil bit of posing, tensing, good posture & bend of the body can change how our bodies look! 🤯

Swipe across to see a bunch of my IG VS REALITY photos showcasing my bloating, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks & loose skin — my body % of the time! 🙊

Which one of these  is your fav? Lmk in the comments, I'll be replying to them all! 💛 Anyway, happy Monday my friends, I give you full permission to walk into this week with confidence & loving self-thoughts! 😏 I hope your week is just as AMAZING as you are! 🧚🏻‍♀️

P.s. I'll be posting some more healthy recipes, workouts, transformation photos from my kg weight loss, a post about bullying & my experience with it (🙅🏻‍♀️) & more to my IG feed throughout the week so stay posted! ✨

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.8815381744351112 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same.
