to get stronger
to reduce stress
to be empowered
to have more energy
to have fun
to improve heart health
to feel confident
to join a community
to improve mobility
to challenge yourself
to sleep better

everyone has a different reason for why they work out and what type of movement they do, and all are valid (including aesthetics- i'm not here to shame anyone who works out to look a certain¬†way!). for me, i choose to move my body to take care of my mental and physical health, to be empowered, and to have fun because you CAN accept your body as it is and not try to change its appearance AND choose to prioritize movement- the two aren't mutually exclusive.

i recently hit  days on my action plan with¬†@insidetracker, a service that analyzes your blood test results and helps you create a personalized action plan to improve your health, and i decided to set up a new action plan with new goals for the upcoming months. this month,¬†@insidetracker's theme is "to get to the heart of what matters" by prioritizing heart health! some of the heart health related goals i added because i found them sustainable for me include:

- cooking at least  dinners a week
- doing about  hour of higher intensity movement a week
- incorporating beans and nuts into my diet

reminders for those struggling to keep going:

your thoughts aren't facts. nobody lies to you as much as you do. trust that there is so much more for you to love, experience, and feel out there.

struggling doesn't make you a burden. asking for help isn't weak. you are so worthy of asking for and receiving the love, care, and compassion you need.

your existence matters. no matter how much you tell yourself otherwise, you offer so much to the world, and the world is a better place with you in it.

you are so much stronger than you know. things may feel worse before they feel better, but please keep going. one day at a time.

- bomb food & drinks at momocho (@momochochef)
- exploring the east side & spending time with my family
- going to some of our favorite local coffee shops (@heartwoodcoffee & @risingstarcoffee)
- going out for ice cream (@masonscreamery & @jenisicecreams)
- watching the browns & spending time with blake's family

there are a lot of people who don't really understand why i'm in a long distance engagement, and i get that because i know it's not the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù. but, blake and i are happy (not to be confused with perfect) in our relationship, and what works for us, works for us. 

with pretty much everything in life, there's some relative idea of what's ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, and most of us try really hard to stay within the confines of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù because we all want to be accepted, do what's ‚Äúright‚Äù, and avoid the judgements and disadvantages that being ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù brings.

choosing to adhere to norms is not inherently bad (it makes sense to want to!), but if it's keeping you stuck, causing you harm, or making you unhappy, it's OKAY to do things differently even if it means being ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù.

this is all to say that normal is a social construct, and normal ‚â† better even if society makes it feel like it.

happy monday & stay radical ü§òüèΩ

i LOVE cooking, but some days the different roles i play in my life take up so much of my time that i finish the day and realize all i ate were snacks

Having @splendid.spoon around has really maximized my productivity, brain power, and gut health with their fully plant based, ready to eat, nutritious meals! They are delivered right to my door in % recyclable packaging (including the bowls and bottles) and the meals are ready to heat and eat!

with the extra time, i get to slow down, really be present with the food, and feel the satisfaction of eating (or respect my hunger signals and eat another bowl! lol)

don't just take my word for it- we're all different!! Whether you are already % plant based or just want to #eatmoreplants, this could be the fit for you :)

i'm proud of you. keep fighting.

love,
 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they're easier to deal with, and when good times come, they're more fully enjoyed.

it's moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i've come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

shoutout to everyone healing from things others don't know about, making progress that no one recognizes, and fighting battles others may not understand.

i see you. I'm proud of you. keep going.

Doc ID: 7940, distribution: 0.2828616825359008 ; over the past two days i've driven past dozens of spots that marked my childhood. each one brought back memories. .
.
i drove past my family's favorite local ice cream shop. i remember sitting in the car while my family stood at the order window, trading crisp green bills for mint green cones.
.
i drove past the exit for my old volleyball gym. i remember sitting in my dads car before practice on warm mornings, two pairs of sweats and my seat heater on. bone cold, bone thin. ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù was a snack pack of apple slices i didn't eat. i remember not wanting to be there but the thought of not burning calories triggered a panic attack. i never missed practice, even though i was miserable.
.
i drove past the frozen yogurt spot that my family stopped at after my th birthday dinner. again, i sat in the car as my mom paid for my two best friends' cups. i watched from the back seat, afraid to walk inside. i remember fearing the ‚Äúsugar in the air‚Äù. IN THE AIR.
.
and then, of course, i drove past the places i never even made it to: the countless restaurant invitations rejected out of fear. the places that buried me alive: the middle school track that i forced myself to run miles around until i saw black. the places that sent my head spinning in circles: the sign for a neighboring town where i stayed inpatient. the one where my first therapist was located. the signs for the next twenty therapists. .
.
i lost years of my life to my eating disorder. being home, seeing my  sisters have a true high school experience full of late nights with friends and traditions (my sister's friend group has taco tuesday on lock!), i always feel a pinch of regret. a yearning for the memories i never made.
.
regretting what i never had doesn't grant it to me now. the best i can do, today, in this moment, and every day going forward, is cherish the time i have in good health. there's a whole life ahead for me to make up for the time behind. regret is natural, it's okay that it's there. let those feelings fuel you forward. accept where you've been, what you've lost. this internal peace is a lifelong pursuit.

To be clear, I do not think this is the apocalypse and I'm wary of doom-sayers who say it is.  But with my own childhood trauma-induced anxieties about the end of the world, I have to be intentional about not letting my fear consume me. I am practicing recognizing that EVEN IF my worst fears were to come true, I wouldn't want to wait for the end of time curled up in my closet hiding. I would want to spend my time experiencing joy and silliness and creating.  Last night I couldn't sleep because I was so anxious and my body felt the old trauma-fear flooding me. I had a panic attack and my body forced me to get sick because it needed that feeling out of me.   So I offer these words for those who might be experiencing increased anxiety like me. I can't make it go away or make the world feel safer. I can't make things feel less overwhelming. But I can tell you that whatever my life on this little blue planet looks like, I don't want it to be one spent hiding and afraid and living in an underground bunker.   Doom is cheap.

as a child i heard things like, ‚Äúi can't, i'm on this new diet‚Äù. or, ‚Äúhave you lost weight? you look amazing‚Äù. the adults in my life didn't have healthy relationships with themselves because they were saturated in diet culture. i can see that now.

i couldn't see that when i was ten years old. when the adults in my life would skip dinner or eat once a day. when they would ‚Äúclose the kitchen‚Äù after a certain time. when they would complain about their clothing sizes in the dressing room at the mall as i sat outside the door.

our relationships with ourselves seep into the lives of those around us. the messaging we are exposed to, the diet culture and fitness industry and all of the lies they profit on are far-reaching. what we take as truth, what we normalize- it becomes part of us. becomes part of who we touch. who we raise. 

by the time i was  i had a full blown eating disorder. 

i didn't grow up surrounded by body positivity- instead i grew up surrounded by subtle notions of body shaming, of exercise addiction, of food fear. 

i don't blame anyone for my eating disorder. it was the result of all of the wrong things meeting at the right time. but i do think the adults in my life could have done better. for themselves and for the youth around them. 

it's such a strange feeling, to want to give back something you never had. i didn't grow up surrounded by body positivity, but i want to give that to everyone around me. i want to be ten years old again and hear the adults in my life compliment each other on their character, not their figure. i want to see them embrace meal times, not find excuses to hide from them. 

i can't go back in time but i can go forward. i can be the role model i never had. the way we treat ourselves, speak to our bodies, interact with food, embrace movement and rest- someone is learning these principles from us, whether we realize it or not.

we have the power to raise an entire generation in which body positivity, self-love, and food freedom are the norm. what a gift. what an honor. i hope we all use it wisely.

‚Äî‚Äî
my options were to . eat half a pizza, be pretty hungry, have to find/cook more food, and eat half a cold (not my preference) pizza the next day, . eat a full pizza and feel a little crappy or, . get food from somewhere else. i chose the third option, which was this incredible spread from @annaintheraw ü§© (and stole a slice of pizza from blake).
‚Äî‚Äî
was this the ‚Äúright‚Äù option? well, i don't think there was a ‚Äúright‚Äù option, but it felt and tasted great, so i'm not going to overthink it.  every option that i listed has its own place.  if i really want cheesy pizza or am in a spot where that's my only choice, i'll get it and not sweat it because i'm not bound by an actual allergy or a restrictive disease like celiac's.

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup ü•∞

Even though I'm a survivor, even though I have not touched a mind or mood altering substance since , even though I have a life beyond my wildest dreams- I was still ashamed for so long to publicly share a fact that made me ‚Äúless then perfect.‚Äù Today I am a little less ashamed because sobriety is what has given me the best moments of my life. Before I got sober I was miserable. A miserable shell of a human who allowed others to treat me like sh*t because that is what I thought-And was broken down to believe- I deserved.

Sobriety has made me emotionally, spiritually and physically (because I actually take care of my body now) stronger, it has open doors that would have remained closed forever, it has literally handed me my dream job, it really has made me believe that there is nothing in this world that I can't get/be if I put the work in, and it truly has saved my life.

In the rooms I have heard the saying- alcoholics are the only people given two lives in one lifetime if they choose sobriety, and I am so damn happy that I have been able to live and love this second life. I do hope this post helps anyone who is struggling who feels all alone in the shame of this disease to know that they so are not alone, that recovery is possible even for the worst alcoholics and I % believe I am that much more amazing in every way because I fight this disease every day.‚Äù

I shook my head to say no, so she just checked in with how I was feeling about it. I said I was anxious but it felt like just normal anxiety now, not lost in all the extra layers of stuff from childhood. I summarised the anxieties I'd had and how I'd moved through them. At one point, T said ‚ÄúYou've done enough work in therapy to know where *that* particular fear came from‚Äù. I do know, and now I'm feeling clear headed about it, I can see it was and is an ungrounded fear. But when I was stuck in the middle of it, I lost perspective on it. I couldn't see any other outcome than the one that was filling my head.  I hope that one of the things I can learn from this episode is that anxiety causes my brain to lie to me. I hope I can remember T's words, speaking truth to me and helping me ground myself back in reality. And if it's a new anxiety that I've not processed directly with her, I can remember the spirit of her words and try and imagine what she would say in the situation.

It's okay to do things you don't really want to do.

It's actually necessary to do things you don't want to do.

In order to be ‚ú®HER‚ú®

When I was on path to going to med school, I knew taking organic chemistry & physics would be necessary. Did i want to? Did i enjoy it? Not really. But they were just a means to a bigger end.

When I decided I wanted to share more of my story and help women transform their lives and love their story, I knew I would have to be more open and share what my offering is. Did I want to show up at first? Did I enjoy the growing pains of starting a business and not many people receiving it? Not really. But these things are just a means to a bigger end.

When I wanted to study ayurveda instead of go to med school, I knew i would have to tell my parents eventually. I knew i would have to face the discomfort of the potential rejection I'd encounter (i was not rejected lol - fears and anxieties go crazy). Did I want to tell them? Did i enjoy the HOURS of conversation about how I am not living up to my potential? Not really. But these conversations were a means to a bigger end of me living as my fullest self.

In these situations‚Ä¶ it's not about what feels GOOD, it's about what we feel good ABOUT.

And when we do more things we feel good ABOUT, even when it gets uncomfortable, we grow wings.

However, for a long long time I lost that. When your mental health crumbles, everything crumbles with it: my confidence, my happy Holly energy, my humour. Everything. I hid my voice in my head, my body in trackies and felt ok with allowing myself to just fade into my shadow.

when i'm going through a depressive episode, I don't lay in bed all day every single day, crying, trying to escape reality through netflix or sad music, and incapable of doing my daily functions. 

some days do look like that, but most days, i can get ready in the morning, i keep working, i interact with others, i smile and laugh, i do enjoyable things, i dance to music, and above all, i experience times of happiness.

one of the most irritating myths about depression to me is that all depressed people are sad all of the time and therefore, people who feel happiness can't be  experiencing depression even if they say they are. it's one look of depression that further stigmatizes the illness and causes many who are struggling with depression to feel trapped between engaging in the sadness and darkening everything around them in order to appear depressed to others and get recognition for it and putting on a face and performing the opposite because sad depressed people are ‚Äúno fun‚Äù.

depression isn't an all or nothing deal, and it manifests itself differently in every individual and at different times.

i've been struggling a lot with my depression lately and have been having a hard time knowing what to say or do about it especially because to many, i don't ‚Äúseem‚Äù like i'm doing that bad.  a reminder for me and maybe for some of you: you don't need to prove yourself to anyone. you only need from validation from one person, and that person is you.

which is interesting, because i rarely say negative things about myself.  i had to consciously do a LOT of work on this area to get to a place where i challenge my automatic judgments and reframe my thoughts. 

a loooot of therapy sessions i had through my eating disorder recovery focused on self-talk. i learned how things like

‚Äústupid‚Äù
‚Äúweird‚Äù
‚Äúgross‚Äù
‚Äúannoying‚Äù
‚Äúselfish‚Äù
‚Äúungrateful‚Äù

were not at all true about me yet i used these words to describe myself sooo easily and readily. i never stopped to actually think about how valid they were before then.

obviously, they weren't. i wouldn't ever call my friends these words, so i worked on paying attention to what i was saying about myself. your body can hear you. my body definitely heard me. 

if i've ‚Äúmastered‚Äù THAT, why do i still feel conflicted when i want to say something nice about myself out loud?

i KNOW i am a good person
i KNOW i am wonderful and smart and valuable
i KNOW i am beautiful and strong and resilient

so why do i keep playing small?
why do i keep pretending like im not all the amazing things?
why does it feel wrong to praise myself as readily and genuinely as i praise my favorite people?
why does it feel like a fight between ‚Äúhumble‚Äù and ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù?
is my hesitance to step into my personal power really any different than my halt in negative self talk?

sometimes i get so caught up in things that just don't matter. earlier this same day i tried on a new pair of jeans (pictured!) and they were a little snug. i didn't dwell on it, but it was in the back of my mind all day. a few days before that i ate more sweets than i anticipated after recipe testing. again, didn't dwell, just held onto at a distance.
.
after recounting the battles of recovery out loud, a wave of rationality crashed on the shores of my mind.
.
in the grand scheme of things, what are these faint thoughts? an extra brownie? a tighter pair of jeans? i have devoted so much time and energy to issues of greater density. endeavors that truly serve me. .
these little blips on my radar became pointless in comparison to my past. recalling my battles reminded me that the mere whispers of my eating disorder are not only irrelevant, but not worth my time. ive worked to put them behind me. to let them develop now? purposeless. .
all of this to say that as the holiday approaches, take a moment to reflect on how far you've come. where you want to be. where you can go. stay mindful of your strength when a triggering thought surfaces. is it worth your time? worth giving into? sit with it, recognize it's there, and understand that there are things in life that matter more. save your energy for greater battles.

I decided that this time I had to persist past the first flush of relationship excitement. I spent a lot of time wondering how long you had to be with someone to know that you would want to be with them for the rest of your life. Eventually it just felt right that we were planning our future together and we began to talk of getting engaged. I think some of it is that it feels right and when we thought of a future together, that felt right. Our beliefs and values and hopes for the future pretty much aligned. And some of it is that after that I made a decision that this is going to be my person, and I stopped considering other options. Marriage doesn't feel warm and fuzzy % of the time so we had to decide we were committed to each other through the good and the bad. So it's heart first and then head coming on board too.

This will also go through my thoughts for my depression and anxiety, and ill document how these are affecting progress.

There will be no measurements included. I won't say what im doing to lose the weight as I don't want to trigger anyone suffering from anorexia that involves working out, but I will include how much I have lost overall every so often so as to give an update but no time frames, again so as to not be a trigger.

.
for a moment i saw a smiling girl on the beach. with envy i longed for her frame. smaller. leaner. i grew angry. what am i doing wrong now that i no longer look this way? i tried to retrace my steps, pin exactly what i changed in my day-to-day. .
.
then it all came flooding back. last summer was‚Ä¶hard. for the first few weeks i was pretty sick, spending most of my days in bed with no appetite. right when i began feeling better i started a - full time job that i hated. every day was a  hour commute. i was burnt out, uninspired, and miserable.
.
.
i realized the pictures i was looking at were so surface level. i saw a smiling girl and i wanted her life. i couldn't see the misery and lack of self-love that marked her life. from the outside looking in you'd never know that i wasn't taking care of myself the way i should have been.
.
.
last summer i loved myself less than i do now. i still had disordered rules surrounding food, exercise, and my body that i let dictate my life. .
.
i contrasted this observation to this summer. sure my body may be different, and sure i don't always love it, but i'm happy. i love myself more than ever before. rules that terrified me last year have no place in my life today. .
.
i realized that if this is what my body looks like when i'm living my fullest life, then so be it. i'd choose this again and again. for me, having a smaller waist and leaner legs comes by way of self-hate and misery. i never want to be in that headspace again. since that headspace is attached to that body‚Ä¶i must part ways with it too.

to the girl i was, i don't miss you anymore. i don't long for what you had, because in hindsight i see the consequences that were attached. i'm finally in a place where i value the life i lead over the body i lead it in. welcoming change with grace. accepting truth with love. .

Most of us are now aware that it happens, but do you know WHY your body always looks different by the end of the day???

You haven't:
suddenly gained weight ‚ùå
eaten too much ‚ùå
made bad food choices ‚ùå
not exercised enough ‚ùå
done SOMETHING wrong ‚ùå

The truth???
If you step on the scale several times throughout the day, you'll never see the same number. So many factors contribute to the way your body changes throughout the day: food, drinks, hormones, exercise or lack of, allergies, medication, salt/sodium intake, state of hydration & so on.

So out of curiosity, I documented my body's changes yesterday & this is what happened:

üïì When I first woke up, my tummy looked 'deflated', that's because my body had plenty of time overnight to digest & break down the food in my tummy. Also, we often become dehydrated after many hours without food & drink which makes our tummies appear slimmer.

üï¢ My weight increased after every meal & snack! But remember, this is only temporary! 

üï¶ By the end of the day, I was almost kgs heavier than I was at the start of the day!

It's common for the average body to fluctuate in weight by -kgs over the course of a single day (sometimes more). However, it doesn't reflect an increase in body fat. So next time you're confused about your bloating & body changes, remember that your body is working hard & doing everything it needs to. Don't be so hard on yourself!! ü•∞

For anyone wondering: no my bloating isn't uncomfortable or painful. I just eat a lot of food & stay hydrated so yes, it swells up üòÑ

BUT if your bloating causes you pain & discomfort, you may need to consult a doctor üíõ

I'd had my running clothes on the whole of the day before but never managed to get a window in the day to go, so I was determined to get out. I pushed myself to do some bursts of hard running with recovery minutes in between, because I knew it would make me feel good afterwards.  Then I got on with reading a book, instead of mindless browsing on the internet. That felt good too. I cooked aubergine parmigiana for tea, although we didn't have any Parmesan so it was an aubergine cheddarama instead. I haven't done much cooking recently because d always wants to cook the evening meal, and I've missed it. I like cooking. Happily d has got a job in a local cafe and did her first shift yesterday so her love of cooking now has another outlet! Today, for now, I'm feeling a bit brighter and more motivated with life. I'm still unsure as to whether agreeing to take a second foster baby in a couple of weeks was a good move. I can still say no, although I probably won't. I'm just having doubts and thinking about how crazy it is going to make life and do I really want that. I don't know. I value my minutes of free time in the day and with two babies there really won't be many of those.

I am certainly on a high right now in Australia and having the. best. time. However I've felt my fair share of homesickness, been to hospital (ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), waited over  hours for a cancelled flight, spent hours (no joke, hours) trying to do my washing after leaving it outside to get soaked in a tropical thunder storm ... the list goes on.

Basically, the point of this little ramble is to say that life is not always happy days. Instagram especially, only seems to capture the gram worthy shots and these are not in any way representative of someone's life whatsoever! Please remember that. Scroll down my feed and yes ok, it looks like I've never had a down day since arriving here in Australia. However if you watch my vlogs, I think they'll tell you a different story ü§î ...

Anyyyyyway, I hope you enjoyed my last vlog from Cairns with @unclebrianstours (gifted). I can hands down say that this is where I've made the best travel memories so far, and I am so excited for more crazy adventures in the next couple of months whilst I'm still here. Right now, and I never thought I'd say this, I feel as if leaving this place is going to be very difficult üò©üò•

Doc ID: 15792, distribution: 0.6370441573978701 ; Monday exhaustion  I wrote my post about cooking for the neighbours this morning when I was bright and full of energy. Truth is, it took me most of the day to cook that dish, interspersed as it was with looking after the baby and trying to line-manage the teenagers. It was done by .pm and delivered to their doorsteps and it was totally worth it, it just takes it out of me. And I don't know what to do with d who would lie in bed all day if I let her, and who will happily go a whole day without really talking to any other members of the family. Should I leave her to it or exert a bit of parental control? Today I told her that if she wouldn't take responsibility for her physical and mental well-being then I would have to do it for her, and some of that involved getting out of bed, getting dressed and getting some fresh air. I did get her out for a walk with the baby and I, because she and I needed to talk about something and trying to get any privacy in lockdown is very difficult. It wasn't a very successful conversation and now she says she's never coming on a walk with me again. So, that went well. Not. d and d cause minor ructions but nothing that's really a big deal, except when it's the thing that tips me over the edge after a long and tiring day.  Trying to remember that lockdown is difficult and to go easy on myself and that not every day will go well. It's been five weeks now and I am missing my space and the usual ebb and flow of a day as everyone else leaves the house and then returns later.

Is it because of their facial features? The way their body ‚Äúdoesn't wobble‚Äù when they walk? Their curves? Their physique? Their jawline?

I didn't think so ü´£

Now picture someone telling them:
‚ÄúYou'd be more loveable if you were thinner‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can't go to the gym‚Ä¶ You don't have a 'gym body'‚Äù
‚ÄúShe's so much better than you‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don't deserve to eat‚Äù
‚ÄúSuck it in babe, you look terrible!‚Äù

I mean.. Sorry but I would NEVER let someone speak to my loved ones that way. I would tell them to cut that person out of their lives because they'll only bring them down. It's the downright disrespect for me ü•µüëä

Ask yourself, ‚Äúam I okay with someone speaking to my loved ones that way?‚Äù

If your answer is no, then why is it okay for you to speak to YOURSELF like that?

Start speaking to yourself like someone you love. 

It won't be easy. It'll feel a little weird, because naturally we're our own harshest critic, but what if we became our own biggest hype girl?

What if we filled our thoughts with positive, affirming, gentler thoughts? What if we looked in the mirror or saw photos like the ones on the right where we aren't posed & thought ‚ÄúTHANK YOU BODY, FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR ME‚Äù

Words are energy. Every time you tell yourself you aren't good enough, or get stuck comparing yourself to others, or listen to someone who tells you to eat less, or make jokes about your weight in front of others, your body takes that on board. When you change the way you speak to yourself, you'll change your life.

TW it feels like on some days everything is okay and i'm already better, but most of the time i have to put in so much effort and it's draining. there is progress and i do see it, as well as i know that recovery isn't linear and relapses/throwbacks happen, yet it is somewhat frustrating like, so often i still have to actively turn packages around or look elsewhere to prevent myself from looking at the nutrition chart. well and i know the amount of calories in many foods anyway, so then it's about actively ~not~ counting it all together, even though my brain keeps making rough estimates  or this last weekend, i relapsed into behaviours i hadn't used in well over a year and only kept myself from using others because i did not want her to pick up on them. it was very bad for only  days and i am trying to get back on track now, but i can absolutely feel the effects already. no, that one little thing you are allowing back in is NOT okay. it's just one more tiny comforting behaviour and one more, until suddenly you stand there and ask yourself how you could let this happen. again ‚Ä¶ ! it's not that bad, but i do see now that i definitely have to change something and be careful, this is a slippery slope on a side note ‚Ä¶ my body image highkey sucks at the moment, so much that in combination with the food issue, it truly sucks how insecure i am about my appearance and how it affects my general behaviour around my girlfriend. i always feel her touch but also wonder how it feels for her, flinching away increasingly often because of insecurity

Doc ID: 14480, distribution: 0.827453776165729 ; Therapy .. // i don't want to be grown up  Somewhere in amongst T talking about how much progress I had made in therapy and how now it was like me leading the way and her following behind me, I managed to say something I've been thinking since Christmas. I nearly said it at the end of a previous session a few weeks ago, and vaguely did, and T didn't understand and then because we were so nearly out of time then, I decided not to pursue it. So this session, when it came up I took the plunge. ‚ÄúI know it's good, that I'm doing so much better now. It's good that I can be my own adult voice and keep myself on track with eating, and even when I am late with a meal or don't want to eat something, I can tell myself that this is what I need to do. But sometimes I don't want to be the one to do that! I miss back when I was unwell, and I would text you in a panic over something I couldn't get out of eating, and you would tell me it would be ok and I could eat it, or I needed to eat it, or whatever. I miss that‚Ä¶. although I do know that it was also awful. I mean, the food aspect made me completely stressed out, and then texting you and reaching out for that connection, made me completely stressed out too, so I know it wasn't a lovely place to be. But I just miss someone else making food feel ok for me. There's part of me that doesn't want to be the grown up with it and have to do it for myself.‚Äù By the way, I definitely didn't say it in one long clear paragraph like that. It came out in fits and starts with T prompting and asking for clarification along the way. We've been working together for so long that she knows how to help me keep talking, what prompts to use. I know that she knows, so when I trail off and she gets me going again, I know exactly what she is doing but I submit myself to the process and go with it. It's like a back and forth between the part of me that wants to share and the part of me that wants to protect myself from being vulnerable. T helps the sharing part to keep coming forward. When I'd got it all out and T had understood it, she said I was very brave to say that and she knows it takes courage to admit something like that. I felt relieved that I'd managed to say it all. I know I can't go back to that child-like state where I depend on T to monitor my eating and look after me food-wise and I only ate because T made me agree to do so. I know it was hellish at the time so I don't even want to, but it's the *feeling* of T being so nurturing and caretaking and me feeling so child-like and reparented that I miss. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15173, distribution: 0.8779049389626469 ; Therapy .. // I was telling you the FACTS! // a messy session  T must have read my face and my hesitation when she asked me about how brutally honest I wanted her to be, because she said ‚ÄúOk, how about I ask you a question instead?‚Äù She asked me what I would have done, if I were my parents making a decision about their child moving ahead school years. I said that I might have gone with the first year but not the second year. That led into me giving a long explanation of the circumstances around me moving ahead two years and the decision-making that I think went on around it.  T asked me if there'd been talk of me taking a Gap year after sixth form before I went to university, and I said it had been mentioned but that there wasn't anything exciting that you could do at age  in a Gap year then because for most stuff you had to be  or over for their insurance policies. I wondered out loud whether my parents should have pushed more for me to take a Gap year or whether I should have had the insight to think that it might not be best for me to go to university so young, or was it reasonable for me to just follow the system. What if my parents had said no, I needed to stay at home for another year. ‚ÄúThey could have had me at home for two more years than they did! If they'd wanted me there, they could have had me there.‚Äù It's a thought I don't think I've ever put into words out loud before. ‚ÄúOhhhh‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ is that what this is all about?‚Äù T asked.  I was temporarily shocked by what I just said, so I said ‚ÄúUh, is what what it's all about?‚Äù T said ‚ÄúWell, you've just spent  minutes defending your parents and their decisions, and now you're saying they could have had you at home longer.‚Äù All I heard was the first part of that. It felt like all our attunement fell away in an instant and T ‚Äúdropped‚Äù me, emotionally-speaking. I don't know what T observed looking at me, but I felt a big shift happen inside me. ‚ÄúI don't think I was defending my parents!‚Äù I exclaimed. I pulled away, as much as you can over Skype, from our connection. T said ‚Äúok but you were explaining why they made the decisions they did‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI was telling you the FACTS!‚Äù I fired back. T said something else, which I can't remember. I think she asked me another question. I ignored her question and said grumpily, ‚ÄúI'm all confused, because now it feels like we've been talking at cross-purposes all this time‚Äù I was telling T the story of moving up two academic years, which is a story I have told hundreds of times in my life, and she thinks I was defending my parents. I got overwhelmed by all the feelings suddenly swirling up in me, and T sitting in front of me trying to keep the conversation going, and I did something which I haven't done in therapy for years . I flopped over sideways off-screen and hid my face on my legs, so T couldn't see me anymore. Then I just did some breathing and tried to see my way forward out of the swirling emotions. T waited a bit and then started talking. I've no idea what she said. I peeked round eventually and I was surprised to see her still on the screen. I don't know why I was surprised.  I told myself that I don't want to use the rest of the session hiding off screen, and I don't want to have to end while we are still in this mess, so I need to sit back up and have the conversation. I did manage to sit up and be back on screen again, although I kept my legs drawn up in front of me in a defensive way. ‚ÄúAre you angry with me?‚Äù T asked. I glanced at her and told her ‚Äúyes‚Äù. ‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ we don't really have time to talk about it anymore today‚Ä¶ it's time to end‚Ä¶ so do you want to unwind for five minutes? - or do you just want to leave it there?‚Äù I paused while I had a bit of an internal battle between wanting to just walk away and wanting to have a little bit of connection so I don't have to carry this feeling with me all week. ‚ÄúI just want to leave it there, but I'll probably feel worse if I do.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk‚Äù T said, and started making some chat about d. It was hard to push through and respond to her questions, but I did mutter a couple of answers, and T tried hard to empathise and remind me of my strengths and say some positive things. It seems very strange that I can be angry with someone, and also at the same time manage to have a normal(ish) conversation with them. Looking back, I do appreciate that even while she knew I was angry with her, T also didn't want to leave me in that place all week but tried to rebuild a bit of our connection and positive feeling in the few minutes we had left.  We ended with scheduling and then we both said ‚Äúbye‚Äù and I clicked off. Usually I say thankyou as well but I wasn't feeling it this week so I didn't.

Doc ID: 2627, distribution: 0.1776424997353525 ; Why I shifted my mindset & goals from ‚Äúhow to be skinny‚Äù to ‚Äúhow to be HEALTHY‚Äù üëáüèª

I realised that maintaining my physique as it was on the left meant:
‚úñÔ∏è having no period
‚úñÔ∏è tracking my food intake every day
‚úñÔ∏è ignoring my body's natural hunger cues 
‚úñÔ∏è fearing fun events + more
It was all-consuming. I couldn't maintain that.

The extra - pounds you see on the right is MY LIFE. It's listening to my body's natural hunger cues. It's enjoying myself at events. It's ordering what I actually want off the menu. It's exercising because I can, not because I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. It's eating when I feel hungry without feeling the urge to go overboard. It's spontaneous picnics with friends. It's baking & licking the bowl. It's cutting down on my workouts because some days I'm not mentally or physically ready for them. It's going on holidays & being okay with being out of my usual routine. Those few extra kilos are my favourite memories, my freedom, my happiness üåà

And THAT is so much more rewarding than having abs or a thigh gap, I promise you üôèüèº 

With the mindset shift from ‚Äúskinny‚Äù to ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, I became so much more confident in my body as well. Because it was no longer about trying to LOOK a certain way, but rather about FEELING my best on the inside. I could finally now embrace my body's normalities, such as bloating, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks, hip dips & wobbly parts... These things are all perfectly normal & healthy, which is something I'm so grateful for. 

Repeat after me: food freedom doesn't mean you're losing control, it means you're GAINING your life back üôåüèº

Sometimes the very thing you're afraid of doing is what will set you free ü¶ã

Be honest, what's your goal at the moment? If it's aesthetic, leave a 'üëô' in the comments & if it's to be truly happy & healthy on the inside, leave a 'üí™üèº' in the comments.

I spent most of my life abusing my body with unloving thoughts & fad diets (& I know I'm not the only one), so I feel like it's important to share some of the things that finally helped me change my mindset & lifestyle FOR GOOD! ‚§µÔ∏è

- you can't hate your body into a shape you will love, showing some love to the body you're in is much more effective
- exercise in ways you enjoy and because you CAN (what a blessing), not because you 'have to'!
- if your goal is weight loss, learn about calorie deficits... To lose weight you must consume less calories than you burn each day. This means you can still eat the foods you enjoy so long as you remain in a calorie deficit
- fuel your body with nutritious foods & allow yourself to enjoy a meal you crave every day. Remember, this needs to be sustainable!!! So going cold turkey & cutting out your fav foods will never work long-term. If you still enjoy a treat each day, you won't feel like you're missing out, feel guilty about it or be tempted to throw in the towel & binge
- remember that it won't happen overnight, but it WILL happen so long as you keep at it üåü
- one 'bad' meal doesn't mean you have to have a bad day... 
- eating too little can actually slow your metabolism, stall weight loss & harm your health long-term... Please eat enough üíõ
- it takes an excess of , calories ON TOP OF the calories your body burns each day for you to gain a kilo... So no, over-eating on one day won't make you gain weight! But over-eating consistently will. 
- rest is just as important for success, your body needs time to recover! It goes through a lot every day just to keep you alive üåü
- the scales are fickle & unpredictable, the numbers will change day-to-day due to your hormones, if your muscles are inflamed, if you're dehydrated, if you've eaten a lot of sodium, etc so please don't let this determine how you feel about yourself! 

I hope this helps in some way?! Lmk if it does! No matter what your health goals are... You've got this! ü•∞

Start speaking to yourself and your body like it belongs to someone you love.

had a really incredible dinner at @vedgephiladelphia last night, and i couldn't have asked for a better meal to celebrate my birthday with. even though neither blake nor i are vegan, every dish we had was *chef's kiss*

this birthday was definitely different than others - i cried twice even though nothing ‚Äúhappened‚Äù, i felt a lot of the heaviness of the world, the only person who i got to hug was blake, and i felt a lot more disconnected to the people i love in my life - but, none of that was ‚Äúbad‚Äù, and the day was so special in its own ways.

this year has taught me a lot about accepting life's circumstances, change, the unknown, my feelings, and myself, and i wouldn't haven't wished yesterday to have been any different because there's soooo much i feel grateful for (including all of you!), and i trust in the universe that all of this is leading to something more.

i know i'm not the only one feeling the weight of the world, so here's a üåπ for anyone who needs it. CHEERS to making it to friday!!

p.s. as much as i want to normalize struggling especially in the world's current circumstances, i don't want to normalize not reaching out for help if you need it. it's okay to feel pain, but you deserve to feel joy too.

- / cup nut butter of choice (i used cashew)
-  tbsp coconut sugar

- cinnamon
- pumpkin pie spice

mix the nut butter, coconut sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin pur√©e together until smooth. add the flour and spices and mix until well-combined (may have to use your hands here until a dough forms). roll into balls and freeze for about an hour or until firm. topping is just two scoops of vanilla protein powder mixed with almond milk until desired consistency (mine was a bit thick but still runny) and chopped nuts. place back in the freezer to set! i like these best thawed for a minutes when they're soft!

Doc ID: 6801, distribution: 0.7045873945128933 ; as someone who struggled with disordered eating for years, i've truly come to value the importance of healthy and happy hormones üíìüíì

i used to be so afraid to eat high fat foods, which in hindsight is absolutely wild to me. a nutrient dense recipe like this one is now my body's best friend‚Äî tasty, nourishing, and satiating. 

a bit of a rant but i hope it reaches someone who needs to hear it today. food should not be feared but rather embraced üôè

i digress ü§™ this recipe is loaded with many anti-inflammatory ingredients that will help balance hormone levels and keep you happy and healthy‚Äî especially during *that* time of the month yayyyy. i've been crumbling these into yogurt bowls or enjoying with a smoothie on the side. just some ideas that hopefully inspire you to make a batch!

snack for healthy hormones 

sweet & salty chocolate bars 

to a food processor add and blend the following:

- - medium soft pitted dates
- / cup raw almonds
- / cup raw walnuts
-  tbsp ground flaxseed
- / cup cacao powder
- / cup chocolate protein powder (this is optional)
-  tbsp maca powder
-  tbsp maple syrup
- **don't add right away, but you'll need water to blend (i add up to / cup in  tbsp increments as the blender is going)

blend everything and slowly add the water as the food processor is running. this will allow a formable, sticky dough to form. once this consistency is achieved, transfer the mixture to a parchment paper lined tupperware or loaf pan and place in the fridge to set for a few minutes. i topped mine with melted dark chocolate (/ cup chocolate chips with  tbsp tahini, melted in the microwave until smooth). i like melting my chocolate with tahini over coconut oil because the result is richer/thicker and it doesn't crack when sliced into!

pour the chocolate over top and place back in the fridge to set. once hardened, slice into bars and enjoy!

toast your banana bread.

leave it to me to bake up a fresh loaf before finding out that today is a national banana bread holiday üëÄ i love where my head is at hahaha

that being said, what better day than today to save this recipe and make it for later? i've tried hundreds of gluten free banana bread recipes over the years but i always come back to this one. i've never met a texture more perfect than this one!

and of course, once it's all baked up and cooled, you need to toss a thick slice in the toaster until golden brown, then top with some butter and chocolate chunks. i really can't emphasize enough how dreamy and satisfying each bite is‚Ä¶ wow. hope you try it out for yourself!

- pinch each of sea salt, baking powder, and cinnamon

-  cup chocolate chips

directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth.	emove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer.‚Ä®.‚Ä®.‚Ä®.

a small hack that will absolutely change your life hahaha. the only way i'm eating banana bread now on is to toast up a thick, fresh slice in the toaster for - minutes or until golden brown. while the slice is still hot, add some butter and a handful of chocolate chips and let everything melt/swirl together. 

i really can't emphasize enough how cozy and nourishing this way of eating banana bread is. as if banana bread wasn't perfect on it's own, the only thing that could possibly make it better obviously had to be melted butter and warm chocolate.

recipe for the loaf is below!

classic gluten-free banana bread

preheat oven to F and prepare a loaf pan.

wet ingredients:

-  large ripe bananas, mashed
- / cup olive oil 
-  eggs 
- / cup coconut syrup 
- splash of vanilla

dry ingredients:
-  cups gluten-free flour
- pinch each of sea salt, baking powder, and cinnamon 

mix the wet ingredients together until well-combined. in a separate bowl, do the same for the dry ingredients. add the dry mixture to the wet and fold until uniform. i stirred through about / cup candied pecans at the last minute :) transfer batter to the prepared loaf pan and bake for - minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. let cool completely before slicing or icing. i iced mine with  cup powdered sugar mixed with  tbsp milk until a glaze formed, then poured over the top and let set in the fridge before slicing.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave‚Äî all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

But I think eventually that framework becomes harmful. Because your eating disorder is not actually an abusive ex, it's your brain, which on some level is helping you survive. Your eating disorder is not evil, it's protective. Your brain is not evil. And I truly believe this: your brain is not trying to kill you (and even with SI, your brain is still functioning to help you survive pain by providing a way to cope). Your brain is doing its absolute best to get you through the hard stuff. I am, of course, not trying to romanticize self-destructive behaviors or SI.

Doc ID: 12277, distribution: 1.0 ; Since we're about a month out from NEDA's annual eating disorder awareness week, I anticipate lots of language will start cropping up around ‚Äúfighting‚Äù your eating disorder or in some way demonizing it. But in my experience, compassion toward your eating disorder takes you further in recovery. It seems that it's still a relatively foreign concept in the ED recovery community to talk about the self-destructive parts of your brain as protective and creative (which is simply seeing their function, not romanticizing) instead of monstrous. But that shift in framing makes a difference. The eating disorder part is an attempt to survive or cope with (most often) trauma. Seeing it as a part of self that is trying to tell you something & trying to help you through in a creative, if ultimately maladaptive way gives you room to stop beating yourself up.

A part of me feels like I never had the ‚Äúfull experience‚Äù of an eating disorder because I was never criticized for it. On Instagram I see a lot of posts about people who fought against everything and everyone to recover and start their treatment (which sounds horrible and makes me very angry), but the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is just my old bad habit of comparing myself with others.
I should not require myself to comply with a list of experiences to say that I suffered from an eating disorder because everyone experiences it differently. I had an eating disorder and when I try to convence myself of the contrary, I only give thought to the voice of the disorder self-invalidating me. And tbh? I'm sick of listening to it

Doc ID: 7339, distribution: 0.5701047110749771 ; i like to think that we have some control over what happens to us.

i'm a firm believer in ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason‚Äù. i find comfort in knowing i can't control most things. while i may not be able to control EVERYTHING that happens to me, i can learn from what i go through.

when i finished inpatient treatment for my eating disorder, i had to return to normal life after months living in a hospital under constant supervision. i had to return to being a normal  year old high schooler. adjusting was hard. i felt fragile.

the hardest thing about this time was learning to cope with what i couldn't control. in the hospital our conversations were monitored; no talk of calories or weight was permitted. we weren't allowed to wear tight clothing, didn't own full body mirrors. it was a whole different world, built to protect. everything was controlled to keep us safe from ourselves.

the real world doesn't work this way. things happen to us, and they could be triggering. i learned over time what my triggers are, these things that i can't control. and i learned how to react to them. i learned from what i went through. i still learn from what i go through.

the world is a scary place. it's not always working in our favor. i went back to school, with fresh weight gain and emotional wounds. i was surrounded by high school girls who talked about weight, who skipped lunch, who obsessed over being small. i felt helpless. i was hurting from being in this setting, but what power did i have?

i learned to stand up for my needs. i removed myself from conversations. i distanced myself from toxic relationships. i fell into friend groups with more meaningful interests. if i was uncomfortable, i called my mom, my best friend. i meditated. i couldn't control everything around me but i learned how to cope. 
we are undoubtedly in unstable times. things are happening to us that we can't control. we may feel triggered or weak. remember to feel these things. acknowledge them. and then ask yourself what you can do to work through them. you have control over how you react, and therefore what happens to you next. make the right choice...even if it's hard ‚ô•Ô∏è

Doc ID: 2545, distribution: 0.5148937341417625 ; STORY TIME: When I was  years old, I went to a school disco that impacted my life forever (swipe to the rd frame to see a photo from it) ü•≤ | ad.

As I walked into the hall, a group of girls circled around me. They laughed at the way my tummy poked out, called me names, told me I eat too much & shouldn't wear tight clothes, among other things.

That moment in time really stuck with me. I'm not telling you guys this for sympathy, in fact, I feel like that experience impacted me in a positive way because, eventually, it taught me the importance of kindness & self love. 

But, immediately after that happened, I decided to stay away from the food that was being served at the disco because I thought my body didn't deserve it. I also started wearing baggy clothes to hide my body.

That same way of thinking stayed with me for a few years after that. I spent my teenage years in a cycle of restricting & bingeing, feeling worthless & disgusting in my body üò£

I wish I could tell my younger self now that I was doing myself more harm than good. 

I wish I could tell myself ‚ÄúEat. You need to eat. You deserve to eat.‚Äù

But this is what I've learned since then:
üçù Food is your friend. It's energy! üôèüèº 
ü´Ç Kindness can change the world!! Spread it whenever you can üôå
üí¨ Words have power. Use them carefully üíõ
üß¨ Bodies come in all different shapes & sizes, this is normal! Yours doesn't have to look like hers!
ü§≥üèª % of people are walking around sucking their tummy in, editing their photos, posing carefully & using angles to look the way they think they have to look.

Doc ID: 23548, distribution: 1.0 ; need-my-pills:  Something I'm learning through recovery is the need for aggressive self advocacy, even when you don't want to take care of yourself. Especially when you don't want to take care of yourself. On days where you're running late and you can't imagine taking more time out of your morning to have breakfast, or when you only have a half hour between classes and don't have time for lunch, your ED is going to latch onto that shit. You need to have a plan in place of how you are going to advocate for your health when your mind and everything around you is telling you you can't. Stash a box of granola bars in your car, throw a pb&j in your bag, whatever you need to do. Life is always going to be throwing challenges at you, and your ED will use whatever it can as a way to keep itself going. You need to learn how to put your health first.  Agreed! Gotta stay in focus or else ed will sneak its way back in, one way or another

Doc ID: 7905, distribution: 1.0 ; at  years old, i had to relearn nearly everything i knew about being human.
.
my eating disorder had turned me into a zombie, a machine. it drained me like a parasite. it stripped me of every last touch of life. i was empty, always empty. .
so when i finally began a true recovery, i had to leave this behind.
.
i had to relearn the simple things. how to walk across a room without growing lightheaded. how to climb stairs without taking a break to sit after each ascent upward. how to sit in a chair without my tailbone screaming with agony.
.
i had to relearn the things that human beings naturally seek out for their well-being. how to eat without a demon in my ear insisting i would self-combust for doing so. how to stay put when an anxiety attack whirled inside my stomach. why? because my sisters got to go for runs and my teammates got to go to practice and me? i wasn't allowed to exercise for months.
.
i had to relearn the things that take you from existing to living. how to laugh again. how to accept an invitation for a meal out, one i couldn't control, in order to mend broken relationships. how to follow my heart instead of my hyper-structured schedule. how to say yes, yes, yes to everything my eating disorder would have never allowed.
.
i had to relearn how to be selfless. how to heal myself so those who loved me could sleep at night. how to accept my body for how it looked and what it could do because it deserved better than a voice in my head. how to skip the gym, have a second lunch, embrace schedule changes in order to accommodate others in my life.
.
and i'm still learning. i'm learning how to love, how to receive love. how to accept. accept the life i've been given, the body i have, the way i look. how to be kind, how to stay stronger than the fleeting whispers of a disordered behavior from lifetimes ago. how to keep going when it feels crippling to do so.
.
recovery from an eating disorder is a lifelong pursuit, an intimate and emotional endeavor to find peace in your own heart. it is hard, it is taxing‚Ä¶but it is stabilizing, it is rewarding. it is the most humbling challenge i will ever take on, and for that i'm deeply grateful.

Doc ID: 7592, distribution: 1.0 ; the entire time i was recovering from my eating disorder, i felt an irrational need to prove myself to everyone around me. .
.
my disorder distorted the world at large. simple effortless tasks were grueling burdens. choosing to lay down instead of walking after a meal required tremendous courage. the same went for grabbing coffee with a friend for a half hour, or using two scoops of peanut butter instead of one. actions that from the outside, appeared thoughtless. .
.
but in my head there was war. i was breaking rules and rebelling against a voice. when i finally mustered the strength to do so, i was left feeling like there was no point. nobody around me seemed to care that i finished my meal without counting the minutes between bites. why bother? .
.
and so it goes. .
.

for the longest time i lived in a state of frustration. eating a half hour before my disorder told me i was allowed to was HARD, so why did my mom just brush it off? not having every single effort recognized complicated my motivation. the steps i were taking were monstrous in my mind but to an outsider were barely noticeable.
.
.
the only way to get better is to keep pushing, to keep doing the right thing even if you're the only damn person who knows just how hard it is. if you pursue a journey for the sake of external validation, you'll never succeed. not fully, not entirely, not in the beautiful way you do when you turn your perspective inward. you know how hard you're working. what else could possibly matter? .
.
what's hard now will stay hard for as long as you allow. facing a fear, no matter how small, how irrational, how seemingly arbitrary, requires strength of unmeasurable proportions. it is worth every second regardless of who notices.
.
.
remember that whatever you're working on, you're doing amazing. .
.
but you don't need me to tell you that.

If I had a penny for every time I heart those words, the unsolicited advice from the well-meaning, misinformed people in my life, I would be swimming in dollar signs. My god, I'm fixed now! I want to say, throwing up my hands dramatically.¬† Why don't you just eat Her words ring in my ears as I stare at the plate in front of me. And my throat is constricted and my jaw tight and my whole body is reacting to the thought of food, nausea already rising. Taking that fork to my mouth feels like a herculean task. Why don't you just eat If only, I think. If only it were that simple.
If only there weren't a Monster living in my head, abusive and controlling and unable to pacified without self-destruction. If only I didn't wake up everyday to this noise / chaos in my mind / the angry voice of the Monster telling me that the only way to make the pain stop is to starve-purge-run it out of me. If only I could look in the mirror without wanting to scrape out the parts of myself that aren't lovely. Maybe then I could eat freely, maybe then I could chew and swallow and smile nicely like the other girls. Why don't you just eat¬† Some people keep their pain on lockdown, but me? I wear it on my body, letting my physical form give words to what cannot be said, what is too terrible to be spoken. When words won't come and my voice gets stuck in my throat, I let my body do the talking, tearing myself apart to let them know the trauma is too much for one small ME to bear. Maybe someday I will be able to ‚Äújust eat,‚Äù nourishing my body intuitively. Maybe someday the disorder will be manageable and the Monster kept at bay. But for now, each bite is mechanical and forced as I try to push through the war going on in my mind, try to remind myself of the life that I am fighting for that is on the other side of this.¬† Why don't you just eat Her mistake is a simple one: she assumes that it is about the food and not about every inch of my body being on fire, every cell bursting at the seams with stories of hardship and survival.  It's the wrong question, I want to tell her. Don't ask me, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FEED YOURSELF NORMALLY, GODAMMIT, because I ask myself that question every single day already. Ask how you can aid me in the battle, how you can join forces with me and help fight the Monster. Ask about the war, not about the food. ‚ÄúWhy don't you just eat?‚Äù she asks me
And I smile politely back at her and say, ‚ÄúI'm trying.‚Äù

Doc ID: 7838, distribution: 1.0 ; my eating disorder recovery was marked by insecurity. .

i was insecure because i was a sophomore in high school and smaller than my th grade sister. i only fit in one pair of kid's leggings, and my skin was pale paper that draped over bone. my eyes were empty black holes that led nowhere, not to a soul, not to a heart. to nothing at all.
.
i was insecure because i was a teenager that had to be monitored like an infant. my recovery called for healing on all fronts. the restoration of weight. the mending of mental health, paranoia, anxiety. i proved that i couldn't be trusted alone in my own company. and so i lost that privilege.
.
i was insecure because my parents made and monitored all of my meals. they rarely went out, fearful i'd capitalize on their absence. lock myself in their room. run through exercise DVD's for hours. when my mom did go out she'd tell my  y/o sister, ‚Äúkeep an eye on angie‚Äù. i was .
.
i was insecure because every nutrition label in our pantry was suffocated by colorful post-it notes- i couldn't be trusted around numbers. my sisters didn't have friends over for dinner- i was a basket case at the table. the kitchen was stripped of harmless tools like measuring cups, and the clock was covered while i ate so i couldn't time myself between bites. .
.

i was insecure because these acts, these needs‚Ä¶were those of a toddler, not a teenager. it was frustrating and scary and i felt trapped, as if i had regressed in time, in maturity.
.
but all discomfort is temporary. a part of me knew that i wouldn't be lost forever, but that i'd stay lost if i resisted.
.
our insecurities have as much power over us as we allow for. we're taught what to feel insecure about based on how closely we align with the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù. .

what we forget is that the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù won't always serve us. the steps i needed to take to recover weren't part of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù teenage life, but they are what gave me that life back.
.
insecurity is not a threat; it is an invitation to rise. my eating disorder recovery was marked by insecurity‚Ä¶at first. life got easier when i embraced the discomfort, worked through it. feeling insecure is normal, but it's not the end.
.
in fact, it's the beginning. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7599, distribution: 1.0 ; recently i received a DM asking if i drink since i promote a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù lifestyle. .
.
the concept of ‚Äúhealth‚Äù is subjective. it looks, feels, and manifests in different ways for every person. what is considered healthy for me may not be healthy for you. and so it goes.
.
.
i spent the majority of my teenage years sick and dying from an eating disorder. i spent friday nights in hospitals instead of at football games. weekends locked in my bedroom sneaking workouts instead of at parties. i lost a lot of time. my formative years, when i was supposed to grow and mature and find myself. .
.
my disorder kept me isolated. locked away. it swore i didn't ‚Äúlike‚Äù things like pizza and staying up late when in reality, i irrationally feared these that behaviors were ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. would ‚Äúruin my progress‚Äù.
.
.
this lying, fearing, missing out, all in the name of ‚Äúhealthy living‚Äù? it's the opposite. it makes you lonely, your soul heavy, your spirit dark. to watch others live from a distance was unfair. i put myself in this position...but didn't that meant i had the power to leave it?
.
.
a healthy lifestyle begins with a balanced mindset. i am my healthiest when i am my happiest, and i am my happiest when i am my freest. yes, i drink socially with my friends. i don't do so because i believe i have to be drunk to have a good time. i do so because i'm young and i can. i refuse to give up more of my youth than i already have.
.
.
once i overcame my fears of not being ‚Äúhealthy /‚Äù, i was overcome by the greatest wave of peace. going out, having fun, drinking a little too much and staying out a little too late. it's all part of growing up. it may not nourish my body but it sure as hell nourishes my soul. and that, that's crucial to leading a ‚Äúhealthy lifestyle‚Äù.
.
.
in short, i drink. i go out with my friends on the weekends and take shots and dance until i can't feel my legs and sleep late the next morning. i'm young. i'm finding my way. what's possibly unhealthy about that? i missed out on way too much growing up. .
.
but not anymore. i'm done throwing away time and memories and relationships all in the name of obeying a toxic voice in my head.
.
.
cheers to that, no?

Doc ID: 12324, distribution: 0.5753641044522606 ; One of the things my therapist and I have been talking about is that the eating disorder part of my brain is sort of like a small child who is really freakin' scared and trying to protect me from danger so it sends me all these signals that I need to engage in [insert self-destructive behavior] to not feel and to protect myself, among other things. I asked her how to get rid of that kid because they're really getting on my nerves and in SUCH a therapist-y way, she told me I do not, in fact, need to. She said that when a child is throwing a tantrum, you don't give in and you don't ignore them, but you get down on their level. you sit with them till the screaming and freaking out passes. Now, to be fair, I know literally nothing about children, so she could have been lying. But that made some sort of sense. I generally get mad at myself for wanting to not eat and try to just will-power myself out of it OR I just give in to the thoughts. But this idea of comforting and being present with the scared part of myself that underlies those desires‚Ä¶ it makes sense. It feels like a much more compassionate stance towards myself.

 Daily reminder that you can do this. Recovery is not easy - in fact it's downright horrible sometimes. But even my worse days in recovery were nothing compared to my worse days with my eating disorder.  It's really difficult to stay on the recovery road, but you have to make sure you're not falling into all or nothing mentality. For example, you skip a meal one day. You might feel all it lost, or that you can't do this. You can. So you missed a meal, then just make sure that tomorrow you eat all your meals + extra. Get right back on track. You can do this.

‚Äî‚Äî
a lot of times, we think eating disorders and restriction, and we think weight loss, underweight and frail bodies, amenorrhea, hair loss, etc. because that's what's most often portrayed in the media.  people who experience all of those have very valid stories, but eating disorders can also look really different from that too.
‚Äî‚Äî
when i first started restricting my food  years ago, i dropped a lot of really fast. i experienced a lot of those symptoms i just listed.  but, when i weight restored, it wasn't because i had chosen recovery- it was because the restriction had developed into binge eating disorder.  i was stuck in the binge and restriction cycle for years (restricting daily and binging nightly), and at my rock bottom, i had gained double the amount of weight i had initially lost, had high blood pressure, had pre-diabetic blood sugar levels, was mentally restricting the most i ever had, yet was eating ,+ calories almost daily, and was filled with self-hatred and guilt.  the worst part? no one in my life even knew what i was doing except for me.
‚Äî‚Äî
now, years filled with ups and downs later, i am ~ pounds lighter than my heaviest weight (interestingly, around the same weight as before my initial restriction), not from restricting, but as a side effect of FOOD FREEDOM and ALLOWING myself to eat whatever and whenever i want. funny how that works, right?
side note: as many of you know, i am currently on a weight gain journey, but it doesn't have to do with my past with disordered eating.
‚Äî‚Äî
i don't talk much about these parts of my disorder and recovery much because honestly, i worry that i'll be discredited and that my story won't be viewed as valid because my recovery involved weight loss.  but, this is my story, and i share it to remind you that eating disorders don't have a look, you are worthy of help no matter how much you eat or weigh, and your story and journey are valid even if you feel alone.

I can't sleep because I'm hungry, or because I've binged and I feel horrifically guilty, or even because I ate ‚Äúnormal‚Äù meals and I'm so not used to it that I feel sick. And then, when I do finally sleep. There is still no escape. I have nightmares about food, about people finding out about my ed, about being morbidly obese. I can't escape. There hasn't been a time in  years that it hasn't been on my mind /. There is no peace, there is no calm. There's is just anger and so much guilt, and so much more depression than anyone without something like this could ever know. At every break of dawn, I am awake, and regretful. The only thing I have to push for, is being skinny, is losing so much weight that even children's clothes won't fit me. I want to end it, I want to rest. But my ed reminds me over and over that I can't suck in my stomach once I'm dead and so I stay. My body will one day give up. My brain is already exhausted.

People who run this sort of blog are also unfortunately fond of tagging their (usually extremely triggering!) content with something like pro recovery or recovery positive- as if that makes it any better or less pro-ed. Rendering tags similar to those, which could reasonably be a good place to put or look for actual recovery content, useless and actively harmful for recovering people. Stop pretending what you're doing is okay. A tag like that doesn't change anything about you or your content.

What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer.

I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of it

I'm on the fence all the time and wonder what is it that will give me that push to choose full on recovery.  Answer: I don't think there was ever a magic moment where I said right! everything is recovery from this point! When I started therapy, all I wanted to do was get control over my bingeing and purging. I wanted to be able to eat like a normal person - go out for a meal without it turning into a disaster. I didn't want to stop restricting or gain any weight though. Gradually as one aspect improved and I felt better, I was motivated to work on the next thing. I discovered how nice it was to live without all the negative impacts of restriction - to feel warm again! to not be snappy with my family! That motivated me not to fall back and to keep pressing forward.My therapist has been a big help, gently pushing me forward all the time and holding my progress when I slip back.I think what I'm saying is for some people there is a moment where they fully commit to full recovery and just go for it, and that's fantastic. I'm more of a little by little person, so taking baby steps towards recovery worked better for me. I feel like it's built me a solid foundation so that even when I slip, I have lots of ground underneath to catch me. Different things work for different people so only you know what will work for you and also you may need some trial and error to see what that is. But don't do nothing! Take the risk and try something and see how it goes. If it doesn't feel right at least on some level, try something else. Go for it x

 Hi guys, sorry for not posting recently, however I had a good reason. Basically, my eating disorder was a fucking bitch in the last couple months and unfortunately I was admitted in hospital. Although the experience has not been exactly lovely, it took rock bottom for me to truly commit to recovery.  Hospital isn't fun. It really isn't. I was lucky to have some lovely, understanding nurses and met a few other patients who could relate to my experiences and all of us were very encouraging to one another - however, my eating disorder made it incredibly hard for me to get through. There were definitely more than a few tears, a few refusals to eat and some truly horrible days. But, my worst days in recovery/hospital were NOTHING compared to my worst days with my eating disorder. And all the worst times in recovery were caused by my eating disorder. The thing is, your eating disorder is not your friend. It's a manipulative bitch that will make you miserable. Thankfully hospital had helped remind me how fucking terrible my eating disorder is and how it has really impacted my life - and my health. My heart has been incredibly weak and for a week I had to be a wheelchair as my pulse deficit was incredibly high. Eating disorders are fucking dangerous y'all.  So, with all that in mind, when I say recovery is always possible - I mean it. I've been through some tough shit and I still made it out. And I'm a fucking dumb bitch. So if I can do it - so can you. It will get better.

Doc ID: 23996, distribution: 0.39460218550700044 ; Question: How did you recover from your eating disorder? Did you see a therapist or go to a treatment center? Did you recover on your own? I'm struggling so hard right now. I'm trying to force myself to eat, but I keep crying after every meal and I honestly feel so disgusting. It feels like it doesn't get easier.  Answer: first of all, i'm sorry you're having such a rough time. and to be honest with you right off the bat - it only gets a little bit easier at first. you have to work really damn hard for incremental results. your struggles will just evolve into new ones as you go‚Ä¶ that scope might not help if you're feeling overwhelmed but its the truth. everything is a challenge, but i will say that letting yourself continue to go deeper into the dark abyss is much more strenuous physically and emotionally, than recovering. recovering is more mentally strenuous because it requires you to evolve, to rewire the way you think. and that's not to say that you still wont be stuck with the physical ailments and side effects from your ed‚Ä¶ because you will. the longer you stay sick, the harder it will be to get better.  staying sick, and getting better, are both challenges. but one leads you nowhere ‚Ä¶ and the other offers a path to redemption - even if you don't believe in it. my recovery unfolded because first, i got caught. i probably would've been dead by now if my parents hadn't discovered my collection of ziplock puke bags, that i'd been stashing in my room like a degenerate. my secret was out but i tried my best to convince my parents i could stop myself and handle it. i couldnt stop myself, lol. so they started (attempting to) monitoring everything i ate and forcing me to eat meals with them. well. i should say they. my mother (when she lived in the household) was the driving authoritarian force behind my recovery. i never did inpatient for my ed (but have def been before for other reasons lol) but i did get sent through the ringer of psychologists, psychiatrists, and dieticians. i was going to appointments like x a week. i loathed spending time at home because even when i had the opportunity to eat and eat normally, my mom was guarding food and really domineering/controlling about what i could have. & that tbh, made everything feel a lot worse. i stopped purging only because she watched me, and inspected everything. even when i hadnt purged she'd accuse me of doing so if she saw a speck on the toilet bowl. at one point i was hiding puke bags in the tile cieling of the basement in her condo that was my ‚Äúroom‚Äù. or i'd vomit in her shower and shove everything down the drain with my bare hands. eventually i gave up on purging because it just became too hard to do, and because i saw a dentist for the first time in  years and it WASNT lookin good for me. my ed has given me approx  cavities and a root canal‚Ä¶ at this point i was still sick mentally and physically despite seeing a bunch of doctors who asked me the same questions that never seemed to help. its easy to lie to health professionals if you dont really want help. easy to convince them that you're doing better than you really are. so then i was still managing to binge but wasnt purging‚Ä¶ and eventually on my own, after ditching the doctors after like a year of useless therapy‚Ä¶ i began to learn how to control my portion size. the invasive thoughts slowly lessened.  just took a lot of self reflection & introspection. around this time i was turning , my mother and i had our final falling out and i was no longer forced to stay with her. which made bingeing easier but i naturally just stopped doing it, given that my environment had improved tenfold just by not having to be in her presence. i was just too exhausted to stuff myself anymore, i couldnt tolerate any more pain.  i still had major digestion problems and discomfort even with normal portions so after a long stab at recovery i slipped back into disordered ways and started restricting. by this point my brain was less concerned with calories and weight, and more concerned with just feeling ‚Äúpure‚Äù. not feeling disgusting. not having to deal with painful digestion. i had  bouts with anorexia, i managed to rebound myself once after the first time, when i got really into vegan health foods. depression got the best of me after a while though and i slipped back into not eating. at this point i wasnt even concerned with the pain or my health or anything at all, i was just too tired to function outside of maintaining a job so that involved not feeding myself. i lasted maybe  months or so on barely any food before i collapsed at home and was bed ridden for weeks. i was at my lowest weight and my dad took notice and took it upon himself to meal prep for me. he just approached me one day and was like ‚Äúhave u been eating‚Äù and i was like ‚Äúno i cant‚Äù. he understood bc he's been in my position before ‚Ä¶cuz when my mother lived with us he'd hide in the basement every day, slept there too. he was barely eating. my dad was a grown man at like lbs and recovered himself. sorry this is so long ill finish up in a text post after this

I didn't have to think about school or being a functioning adult or family drama or the fact that I have no friends. I didn't have to think of anything but the number on the scale going down every day. Constantly body checking, cold, tired, withdrawn. Idk. This have been my best friend since I was . A decade. It's so so fucking hard to let it go. I know I can't live with this. I know it will kill me. But for now I'm just so scared. My therapist was basically like ‚Äúokay, your an adult you can do what you want‚Äù. Which part of me is like ‚Äúoh cool she's giving me a free pass‚Äù. But no, she's just making it super clear she will not and cannot stop me or ‚Äúsave me‚Äù from my eating disordered behaviors. Only I can, and somehow that's empowering but it's also terrifying. I so wish that this was a disease that just swept me away, giving me no choice. But I do have a choice. Every second I do or don't eat is my choice. I hate this.

Can you help with some tips on how to recover when you're surrounded by diet culture and literally everyone around you is dieting and talking down about bikini bodies and weight loss (sadly every girl in my life wants to loose weight and it makes me feel really pressured sometimes and embarrassed when I hear them talking about eating low cal and dieting and all that stuff that I try to avoid) Answer: HOI ANGEL. dang. so i dont know if this is possible for u but the best way to recover is to like‚Ä¶ remove yourself from all of that. change your surroundings, including the people in ur surroundings if thats possible. the greatest strides ive made in recovery have been when ive been isolated and had time to just be by myself. i spent a lot of time outside. i bought myself a hammock that can be wrapped up into the size of a small purse and id take it everywhere with me and whenever i had an opportunity to string it up and sit in a tree, i did. reconnecting with nature helps u reconnect with the self. spend more time outside, alone, and or with animals. if everyone you know is involved in diet cultute the only true way to not hear about it is to not be around them and choose yourself over company. otherwise you just gotta learn to ignore them yano? you obviously know why diet culture is detrimental, you can always passively observe and know better - takes a strong mental tho. my best advice is to hang out with horses instead if you/your parents have the money lmao.  instead of going to the bar with friends go to the bar with a book. aint no shame in kickin it alone so u have time to adequately develop a sense of self yano

So why bother. Literally. Why bother with the constant suffering if it changes nothing about how you feel. Eat. Eating fuels your brain. It fuels your cells to do their cellular job. If youre trying to survive on nothing you will feel like trash emotionally and physically. Why are you so fucking depressed??? Cuz your brain cant take the bullshit. Any brain surviving on XXX will % be a very upset brain. You cant Happy yourself out of that. You dont have the energy to do that. Fucking eat. The biggest hurdle but the most important step to recovery, is letting go of a sick body. You NEED to gain, you need to let go of controlling your body. A healthy body is nourished. A healthy brain doesnt obsess over sizes and numbers. Its not that simple yes it is. Eat. Force your Ed to shut the fuck up. Cry if you need. Scream if you need. But just fucking eat. Your emotional well being, physical wellbeing, and mental health will all improve as you begin actually feeding your brain and body. Duh. Fucking duh. I absolutely see where you're coming from, and being where you're supposed to be physically works wonders on your mind - but in order to really let go of a sick body, you'll need more than just nutritional restoration. I knew I had to eat enough to keep my body alive for years, but the lack of resources for my mindset just invalidated the hell out of me and kept me sicker. You can't recover without taking care of the physical aspect first, but that can only go so far without needing mental help to cope with all of that.If I'm taking your post too literally, I apologize.
I definitely think getting therapy cannot be ignored in recovery. Absolutely people need mental help to get better. Its the physical part a lot of people tend to slack on. Just therapy isnt enough. You cant heal unless you work on both your brain and your body.

Doc ID: 14331, distribution: 0.6656595558930539 ; Therapy .. // eating disorder remission // part one  So this session I thought I would reflect on my eating disorder and how much better it is. I wanted to share this with T to kind of fix it in place, and to show her how far I have come. I talked away for a long time. Several months ago, we spent quite a few weeks wrestling with the idea of me eating cake. It was something I had a huge block about and that was still causing me a lot of eating disorder thoughts. Eventually we got me to a place where I felt like I was able to eat cake, which subsequently had lots of knock on effects, such as being able to eat sweet things at home, less cravings and obsessing, less chewing and spitting etc. It felt like the final big hurdle left in recovery had now been cleared.  I said how with my eating disorder, every eating episode became separate and disconnected from every other. So I couldn't connect that what I ate or didn't eat at one meal or on one day would have a knock on effect on the next meal or next day. Eating, appetite and fuelling my body didn't ‚Äúreset‚Äù every night. Eating a snack in the moment just became a very black or white choice, do I want to put these calories in my body? I couldn't connect it up to how it was just a part of the whole day of eating. But gradually that's something I've learnt to be able to do. To think about nourishing myself as a positive thing and how all these different meals and snacks combine to keep me well fuelled and healthy both mentally and physically. I said how I didn't want to say I was ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù because that seemed overconfident and like I was never going to stumble again. I mentioned that maybe it would be more accurate to say it was in remission. T didn't seem to have come across that concept with regard to eating disorders before. She came back to it and said that was an interesting idea. I wish now I'd asked her a bit more about this, and about what she thought.  I said that although everything was pretty good right now, I could think of situations that might knock me pretty hard. For example, if I got a stomach bug and lost some weight, I feel like I would find that really triggering and I think I could easily fall into that downward spiral. I also said that I knew that in lockdown, life was about as unchallenging as it gets, foodwise. I was eating all my meals at home, eating exactly what I chose, no meals out, no coffee shops with cake to negotiate and so on. I've got to know my body pretty well over the last couple of years, and how it responds and what it needs in various situations and activity levels, and I feel like I am able to make healthy choices for myself now.

Doc ID: 7232, distribution: 1.0 ; eating disorders are complicated. they don't exist in a vacuum. what feels like an incredibly intimate battle is the opposite. when you're sick, every person in your life is too. nobody is untouched by your pain. and this is the heaviest burden.

i was  years old when my relationship with food, exercise, and my body turned toxic. i was an older sister, a daughter, a best friend, a teammate. yet all i ever thought about was me. i planned every meal out for weeks in advance. i wondered how many calories i burned walking to class. i tugged at the waistband of the jeans sliding off my hips, wanting more of me to disappear when there was nothing to spare. 

my sisters, my parents, my best friend, my teammates and coaches- they fell to the outskirts of my life. i had no time in my day to uphold relationships. how could i? when i passed every waking second running circles in my mind over a scoop of peanut butter i ate last week?

i isolated myself. my eating disorder was safe when nobody was around to challenge it. nobody to ask, ‚Äúdidn't you already work out today?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy aren't you eating?‚Äù or ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù. in the beginning i missed these people. i missed their love. but my ED promised me great things in their absence, so i let them go. 

i actively struggled with my ED for  years.  years of pain and misery and throwing fits and screaming matches.  years of running away from dinners in public.  years of skipping my sisters' recitals and games, because i would be forced to eat or miss a workout.  years of projecting pain onto everyone, even though at the time this never crossed my mind. 

i thought because i physically isolated myself, that my ED was contained. but it spread like wildfire. i only know this in hindsight, and it hurts, to see colors where i only saw black and white. 

my family and friends hurt deeply for me. with me. my mom used to always say a mother is only as happy as her saddest child. to this day that moves me to tears. 

we never hurt alone, even if we try our best to do just that. if you can't bring yourself to heal for YOU, then at the very least do it for someone else. i promise they feel your pain.

Many of you guys will know that I went through a pretty roughy period in my teens. I had serious body image issues, obsessed  over calories and severely restricted my food intake. It led me to lose friendships, lose my love for dance and lose the person that people knew as Holly. That crazy girl on YouTube you know now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I found it extremely difficult to open up about what was going on inside my head, and even now I find it hard to explain. I also had no motive to want to help myself, and I saw the rest of my life living that way. In my mind there was just this constant desire to look 'thinner' and eat less. But without any particular 'goal' when would it ever end? 
Ok . . . so THANK GOODNESS I never reached the point of having to be hospitalised. Just as I cannot tell you what triggered my eating disorder, I also don't know exactly what helped me recover. But what I do know is that it started with a change in MY mentality, and nobody else could do that but ME. I changed the way I viewed food and I changed the way I viewed my body. Food become fuel and my body was something to be appreciated, accepted and LOVED. 
Now all this has also taken time. For sure, it did not happen over night. I am also aware that many of you guys out there may have experienced something similar. I opened up about this on my channel quite a while back now, and I would really like to do more to help you.

What if you can create a life that you actually want to present in, one in which you don't have to numb out constantly just to survive?¬† Here's what I'm not saying: life will be pain-free and sparkly-glittery-unicorns every second of every day.

Isn't it worth fighting with every ounce of energy we have left in our tired bodies to get to the other side?¬† It's easier to succumb to the siren song of the disorder, a song of protection from pain and numbness to the trauma we've faced.

people who are struggling with an eating disorder often look a lot like people who don't, and it's a really harmful misconception that you can determine someone's health based on how they look.

 Tw! self harm Telling my mom was very hard. I have a very tight relationship with my mother so a part of me was scared of telling her because i didn't want her to be disappointed, but also, in M√©xico those topics aren't spoken about or we all have a very minimal and limited understanding of what an eating disorder is.¬† So, i've had spent a lot of time considering telling my family about my problem for a while now, since September, because of various factors:¬†
-I realised i had a problem¬†
-I was very tired of not being me¬†
-From September through December I've had lost A LOT of weigh, i was at my lowest and it made me uncomfortable. Losing weight was no longer euphoric¬†
Among others, but it was when i harmed myself for the first time and i got the balls to do it.¬†
 It was December th, and i was in my room eating dinner and I ate chips and omg, the feeling of disgust that washed over me was debilitating, I was full on crying, panicking, shaking, sweating, everything! It just sent me overboard, I was tired of everything, of being me, of being in this situation, of not being able to eat chips without this happening, i was tired of lying, of feeling tired /, of just living the worse version of my life.¬†

I went to the bathroom with my cutter, full on panicking, and made four slashes on my stomach it calmed me down, but then i just started crying even harder and i instinct was ‚Äútell your mom‚Äù and i ran out of my room before i could my mind could even react.¬†

I went to her room and she was getting ready to go out, and as soon as i enter and she saw me, she sat me down on her bed but i couldn't talk, I was just saying¬†‚Äúi am so sorry, I am so sorry‚Äù over and over again, until she just sat there visibly concerned and slowly started getting the information out of me while trying to calm me down.¬†

That night I told her EVERYTHING, from how it started to that night. I don't know how long i talked for but i wanted to get everything out before, it was the first time in a while that my ed voice wasn't active so i just took advantage of it.¬†

It was really hard telling her, I wasn't explaining myself well and she was too stunned and concerned to have patience, but we made it work and at the end, i had erased the bookmarks about dieting and ed related things, my pinterest boards about exercised, agree I will start therapy and to put a firewall on my computer so i can't search certain words or enter certain websites (that was in my old computer). It might seem excessive but again i wanted to start as soon as possible, i was just so tired.¬†

And from that moment on, my recovery began! GOD, to think it will be two years soon is amazing to me, i can say that if I kept the rhythm I had, i wouldn't be here, at all.¬†
Recovery is fucking great!

a few soft reminders for you today:

- weight gain isn't a bad thing :)
- our bodies are not billboards. they don't communicate messages about our character, value, or worth.
- genuine body love comes from loving the right thing: not the physical body itself, but the life it allows you to lead.
- what you see online is usually not an accurate depiction of real life
- bellys are cute and fun
- life is too short to let your physical appearance dictate your happiness. let this go.
- eat something good today üçîüçüüç¶üåÆü•ôüçù

real talk, yesterday, i had negative thoughts and feelings about my body and self rise up, and it felt both familiar and unfamiliar to me at the same time. i've gotten to a place where my previous EDs feel very distant and detached from who i am now, yet, i had a moment where a negative voice that i associate with my EDs crept in.  the difference now compared to when i was still recovering though is that now, i don't even give that voice the time of day. i'm able to step back and see that these negative thoughts only come when other things in my life are more chaotic or stressful, and i know that even just listening to them does only harm and zero good.
‚Äî‚Äî
tbh, i debated sharing that i had these feelings come up because i want to show that fully healthy relationship with food and your body is possible! but, i also want to be real and transparent and let you know that i still have hard days because struggling and being imperfect is what makes us human! recovery doesn't mean never ever having bad body and self image days ever again because having inner turbulence is what helps us to continue to grow.  rather, recovery to me means being able to let go, step back, observe, accept, use the tools in your back pocket, and continue to transform even when everything feels out of control.

Did you know that your brain is always looking for evidence to confirm what you have told it? So if the story in your mind is ‚ÄúI'm not good enough‚Äù, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't. This is why we see our cellulite, rolls, bloating, stretch marks, pimples, wobbly skin, etc as a bad thing‚Ä¶ Because we've been hardwired to believe that from a young age, so our brains constantly put a magnifying glass over these parts of ourselves & make us believe we need work.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative thoughts & overly critical self-talk. But this is why positive affirmations, manifestation & law of attraction have become so popular‚Ä¶ Shifting your mindset & putting your energy into positive thoughts has the power to change your life.

The law of attraction is a philosophy suggesting that positive thoughts bring positive results into a person's life, while negative thoughts bring negative outcomes. Meanwhile, manifestation is bringing something tangible into your life through attraction and belief, i.e. if you think it, it will come. 

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

All it takes is starting the day looking through a positive lens to change your entire perspective. Have you tried it before? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I encourage you to write down in the comments the kind of affirmations you're going to start telling yourself this week‚Ä¶ Here are some that I personally love:

- I am good enough.
- I make others happy!
- My body is healthy and capable and strong! üí™üèº
- How good my day is is up to me!
- I'm loved
- I don't HAVE to workout, nourish my body or get my work done today‚Ä¶ I GET to do those things, and that's a blessing!

How about you? ü•∞ I'd love to hear them & I'm sure they'll give someone else inspiration too!

Doc ID: 2650, distribution: 1.0 ; HAPPY REAL ME MONDAY! ü•∞ Ok, grab a cuppa tea & get comfy because I'm about to get deep‚Ä¶ As most of you know, I've struggled with low self-esteem & a negative relationship with my body image for the first  years of my life. I always compared myself to these ‚Äúperfect‚Äù Instagram models and celebrities online, I wanted to be slimmer, get rid of my cellulite, have a toned flat tummy / & I always felt guilty for eating. 

I ended up losing kgs in , but even at the end of my weight loss journey, I still picked at my ‚Äúflaws‚Äù and wasn't happy. I still got bloated, had cellulite, rolls, a layer of fat around my tummy, my legs still wobbled when I walked, I STILL DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE WOMEN I ASPIRED TO LOOK LIKE. 

The only time I looked somewhat similar to them was when I was tensing hard, sucking in, before I'd eaten and when I posed in unnatural ways. That's when I realised that the photos I was seeing online were posed and ‚Äúperfected‚Äù too. The women I aspired to look like only showed me % of themselves, the perfected % and it was unfair of me to compare the version of my body that I see every day, to the unrealistic version of someone else. And that's when I started to really focus on rewiring my mindset around my body image. I spent all of  practising self love and accepting my body without a need to lose weight, gain muscle, etc.. Just simply enjoy being in my skin without wanting to change it. And then  weeks ago, I started posting the REAL version of me publicly for you guys to see as well, because I'd much prefer to showcase my body's normalities than portray perfection any day! 

It's honestly been one of the best things I've done‚Ä¶  weeks ago I was so terrified to post the first Real Me Monday and today as I click ‚ÄúShare‚Äù I feel nothing but pride. I am who I am, and I like that person. All I hope for with these posts is that it may inspire you to do the same. I love you guys and I'm so grateful you've accepted me for me üíõ

i had received a negative comment about my appearance from a close family member after taking the time and effort to get dressed up, and honestly, it hurt. i felt unattractive. i felt not good enough. i felt like my efforts didn't matter. i felt like my looks mattered way more than they do.

a few reminders:
- ‚Äúflowers are pretty but so are christmas lights, and they look nothing alike‚Äù. we are quick to judge how we look, and it can be easy to compare ourselves, but you are YOUR kind of beautiful, and that will never change.
- beauty is not just about appearances.  how you look is one of the least important things about you. the most important beauty comes from the inside.
- perfection doesn't exist.
- what you think of yourself is way more important than what they think of you.
- people are usually projecting.
- you have a choice. you can choose to say no, to not let other's words affect your actions, and to set boundaries.
- the only person who determines your worth is you.

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

üåü Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
üåü Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
üåü LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world ü•π I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same‚Ä¶ Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
üåü Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
üåü Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you‚Ä¶ 
üåü If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key ü•∞
üåü At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us üíÖ It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible ü´∂

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks üíó

As I was growing up, it was made abundantly clear that the desirable shape was the ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù, with a thigh gap, tiny waist, curves in the right places, firm & toned. It was impossible to measure up. 

So there I was as a young adult, scanning over my body in the mirror only to see a lack of curves, decorated with all of those very normal womanly features we're convinced to hate: cellulite, hip dips, bloating, stretch marks, belly rolls, thighs touching, body hair & fat on my body ‚Äî which btw are all very healthy, normal parts of the human body.

So, I just wanted to remind you as you go into a new week & perhaps have some ‚Äúnew goals‚Äù thanks to a magazine headline like the one above‚Ä¶ Your body is not a ‚Äúshape‚Äù. 

It's a vessel that keeps you alive. 

You're here for a reason‚Ä¶ 
To learn, love, grow, feel, teach, experience, laugh, reflect & connect
‚Ä¶ not to simply ‚Äúlook pretty‚Äù or be a specific ‚Äúshape‚Äù üòÖüôÑ

For me to create the illusion that I have an hourglass body, I had to stand with my feet apart, my tummy tucked in, my arms held out, holding my hands over my thighs, EVERYTHING was tensed. My chest stretched outward & my üçë stuck backward. The list goes on. It's unnatural. 

Your best body is whatever body you're in when you're feeling happy, healthy, comfortable & enjoying your life.

Remember, while you're scrolling online, you're seeing everyone the way they WANT you to see them. Don't forget that the next time you find yourself comparing yourself to someone else, or setting their body as your new ‚Äúgoal‚Äù or standard. 

You are not them. You are uniquely you, and the world is a better place for it. 

Only you have the power to get more comfortable in your skin. Your body is your home. It's the only one you'll ever have. Nurture it, honour it, nourish it, move it, love it & respect it üíõ

No matter your shape, size, colour, gender, features or personality. You deserve to live happily in your skin. You deserve to live a life that is so full of all the things that make you happy, instead of spending each day at war with yourself.

Please don't punish yourself for having things that % of the population have and require to have a healthy, functioning body!!!

Here's a close up photo of my face. Feel free to zoom in & take a close look. There was a time where I felt the need to smooth out any 'imperfections' in order to make my skin look flawless. But the reality is, my skin is textured. I've got a few lumps, pimples & bumps. My brows are messy & yes, that is a monobrow! 

A huge part of becoming more confident in my skin was consciously being kinder to myself & accepting the normalities of my body. When I woke up first thing in the morning & stared at my own reflection in the mirror, I chose to start not only accepting but being positive towards the person I saw looking back.

I'm encouraging you to let me know in the comments what you love about yourself! It could be internal or external, it could be something small or it could be a really big deal! I don't care, I just want to hear y'all being nice to yourselves & owning who you are¬†üòç¬†trust me, IT FEELS GOOD!!!

Something I love about myself is that I'm becoming more comfortable with just being me... Instead of aiming to be perfect, I simply aim to be perfectly happy the way I am. Also for anyone wondering, I don't use a lot of products on my skin/face!  of the only products I do use on the daily is the gentle-foliant from @esmiskinminerals to help gently exfoliate & clean my skin & leave it feeling fresh, soft & smooth!¬†ü•∞

If there's anything I'm hoping y'all take away from this post, it's that you'll put something positive about yourself in the comments & remember how dang AMAZING you are!!! Take that kind of energy & outlook with you for the rest of the day, week, month and year hehe ‚ú®

i still have moments when it's hard to feel ‚Äúenough‚Äù, and i struggle to not ‚Äúgrade‚Äù my worth. in these moments, i remind myself of the commitment i've chosen to make to ACCEPT myself UNCONDITIONALLY aka no. matter. what.

practicing unconditional self-acceptance doesn't mean not having goals and forever being stagnant. what it does mean is not basing your worth on the achievements that may help your self-esteem, not beating yourself down for where you are currently at, and not needing certain conditions to be met to feel worthy.  while you can rate your actions, you can't rate something as complex as your 'self', and while you can fail at something, that doesn't make you are a failure.

if you've ever felt worthless, it's not your fault. we live in a culture that tells us our worth is dependent on what we achieve and the judgements of others. but, you deserve to feel at peace with yourself not just now, but always. some practices i like to include in my routine are:
- confronting my fears
- going outside and remembering my size
- sitting with myself and embracing my body
- forgiving myself and others
- celebrating wins
- being aware and staying neutral
- allowing myself to grieve the loss of my past and unrealized dreams
- doing acts of kindness
- taking care of myself mentally, physically, and emotionally
- speaking to your highest self

you are, have been, and will always be enough. you are worth it.

Posting this video because I can almost guarantee there's some sort of device or product being advertised & sold to ‚Äúfix‚Äù each & every one of these things‚Ä¶ And the industry selling them sure has a wide audience to sell to, considering ALL OF US have these very normal, very human things on our bodies.

If you're comfortable sharing, how many of these things do you have on your own body? üëÜ I'd love to see the comments sprinkled with them to show others how common they really are.

How are we supposed to eventually reach a place of feeling comfortable in our skin if our expectations of beauty (or even just normal human features) aren't attainable?

My answer is, we can't. We just have to bring ourselves back to what's real, and not be so hard on those things, so that we can embrace everything we are üåª

This morning I found another online scam using my ‚ÄúReal Me Monday‚Äù images as fake transformation photos with false outcomes for their own personal gain üí∞

Instead of allowing these external pressures impact the way we view ourselves & push us further away from respecting our bodies, let's lean into showing ourselves love instead. 

I've been thinking about love languages recently & how my love language used to be primarily words of affirmation‚Ä¶ Yet the way I ALWAYS spoke to myself was incredibly harsh. This got me thinking‚Ä¶

What's your love language?

I want to encourage you to do something for yourself that services the way you give & receive love. For e.g. if the way you feel love the most is through words of affirmation, but you constantly speak to yourself negatively, it's no wonder you feel terrible about yourself. That's destructive to your mindspace & confidence. Be mindful of your self-talk. You don't deserve all of the mean things you say to yourself.

If your love language is gifts, pick yourself some flowers or get your nails done üíê if it's quality time, take yourself on a solo date or have a long, relaxing bath üõÅ if it's acts of service, romanticise your to-do list, put on some music, make your space clean & then sit back with a book & enjoy your fresh, cozy space. If it's physical touch‚Ä¶ you know what to do üòâ OR perhaps you can do your skincare routine or book yourself a professional massage. These are just a few ways you can show yourself love üíó 

In the wise words of Miley Cyrus:
üé∂ I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
& I can hold my own hand
I can love me better than you can üé∂ 

Give yourself some of the love you always give to others üíó

Happy Real Me Monday üëë p.s. my kinis are from @remmiebyriley (not an ad)

Doc ID: 9469, distribution: 0.1278565501373661 ; social media isn't inherently bad, and it has the power to do a lot of good like helping people stay in touch, be an outlet for creativity, help spread important information, and create connections and communities. BUT, when we're not careful with our usage and consumption of it, it can quickly become an ego trap that does more harm than good.

i created a couple lists of things to stop and start doing on here to help protect your peace and have a more positive social media experience.

things to stop doing on social media to protect your peace:

- comparing yourself to others or your past self
- tying worth to numbers
- thinking everything you read and see applies to you
- posting to prove something or for external validation
- assuming you know someone else's reality based on what they post
- having no boundaries with it
- following accounts that trigger you, make you doubt yourself, or you just don't want to be following

things to start doing on social media to have a more positive experience:

- remember your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for being and posting on social media
- post what you want to even if it doesn't ‚Äúdo‚Äù as well
- take what you see with a grain of salt
- remember that how your life feels is a lot more important than how it looks
- follow a diversity of people and accounts
- utilize the mute, unfollow, and block button as you see fit
- set boundaries with how much time you spend on it
- remember that social media is not reality

friendly reminder that social media is what you make of it. all of our needs, desires, and minds are different, but i hope you are able to tune into how certain things on here make you feel, make changes accordingly, and not take it all so seriously. we're all just real humans on here doing our best in a complicated society :)

i've had minimal motivation in the kitchen...and most other things in life lately, and you know what? that's okay.

this season of life is hard. i sit in an uncomfortable high chair at my kitchen island  hours a day trying my best to do work. i hardly leave my apartment ever. i feel like i'm repeating the same days over and over. i don't interact with many people. i simultaneously have a lot to do and nothing to do. i keep pushing things off. i'm exhausted.

there's a lot for me to be grateful for, and i'm so proud of myself for everything i've been through, but sometimes life just feels hard, and that's OKAY too. we are allowed to feel real human emotions because we are human beings just doing our freaking best to make it in this crazy world.

productivity may look different these days, but that doesn't make any of us any less worthy or capable.

some affirmations for me (and maybe for you too):

i embrace myself and all the things that make me who i am.

i am on my own path. there is no being behind when the only person on this path is me.

i have enough, and i am enough.

i do not seek perfection. my mistakes are signs of growth and exploration.

i have time to become all that i am meant to be.

i am capable of doing hard things.

i am so rooted in who i am that no one and nothing can disturb my peace.

- it's okay to take a break from the things you love to do
- rest is productive
- you do not have to feel inspired or motivated all the time
- your worth does not lie in the outcome
- letting go does not make you weak; it makes you strong and free
- you deserve to prioritize your peace and joy
- you still have time to become all that you want to be
- your presence alone matters

one of my best friends from college is staying w/ me from out of town for a few days, and this weekend, i'm choosing joy and presence. don't forget that being alive IS the special occasion, and you deserve to spend this weekend in a way that FEELS good for you (even if that LOOKS different than what you think you want) ü§ç

if i could look at the parts i don't like, the ones that don't settle with me and say, ‚Äúah, but that's just how i am, that's how i'm meant to be, so i should move on‚Äù. wouldn't that be easier? not easy, but easIER.

.

i commend these people for their drive and deeply respect their efforts. but it's unnerving to see, sometimes, for me anyway, as someone who is simply trying to be okay with where i am and accepting of what i have.
.
.
accepting my body at its current state is HARD because after seeing proof that change is possible, i feel an immense pressure to‚Ä¶well, change. change my body. change my diet. change my exercise routine. i feel like a fraud for telling myself that this is the body i'm meant to have when i see so many people proving that this isn't the case. i feel bad for not doing more. .
.
of course i know these are irrational thoughts. life after recovery is just that; being able to address irrational thoughts as irrational. acknowledging them but not nurturing them. letting them be and letting them go.
.
.
i bring this up because it's been on my mind. some days are harder than others, you know, dealing with pressure. i share this so somebody can feel seen and relate. together we can read these words back and understand that life after recovery isn't perfect. irrational thoughts will come. pressure will feel heavy. .

it took me a long time to get comfortable with the fact that i'm not for everyone, but guess what? i get to know that the people who DO like me like me for me, not for a facade i'm putting on, and most importantly, i like me.  at the end of the day, the person who spends the most time with you is YOU, so allow yourself to own who you are, your insecurities, your purpose, and your story. you might not be everybody's cup of tea, but as long as you are your own, that's what matters.

Body image is not about how you look, it's about what you think and how you feel.

Doc ID: 7665, distribution: 0.14264164592307077 ; some days i feel super bloated and my jeans feel tight and i swear my skin is foreign, i don't recognize it. some days my body feels like a cage and not a home. these are bad body image days. you don't always have to see your body to experience one. more often than not my worst body image days take place when im on the go, no time to stand in the mirror and pick at my reflection. it's more of a feeling, you know?
.
.
dealing with these thoughts is exhausting, so i choose to take my brain off my body. it takes effort. it requires focus. but it's the best coping mechanism i have.
.
.
awhile ago i realized these bad body image days felt so toxic because all i was thinking about was my body. how soft my stomach feels, how painful my bloating is, how uncomfortable it is that my thighs meet, that they graze each other in stride.
.
.
my brain was on my body. .
.
so i took it off.
.
.
i put my brain on other things. on my job, on a new recipe, on yet another episode of my favorite tv show. i put my brain on a conversation with my sister, on folding laundry, on running errands. distractions. diversions. call them what you want. whatever it takes to wait out the bad thoughts. if you don't engage them, you slowly forget them‚Ä¶i promise.
.
.
that's because all discomfort is temporary. it'll pass, but it can't be on its way if you keep it front and center in your brain, right?
.
.
the next time you have a bad body image day, the kind where you just feel it somewhere deep down, some discomfort, some distaste for the way your body feels‚Ä¶know that you have the power to replace those thoughts with other ones. better ones. more productive and empowering and life-changing ones.

so do it.

Doc ID: 7028, distribution: 0.31646311862378357 ; i've always been hesitant about posting images like this.

i've worried that the gravity of food & body image struggles, which are incredibly mental, would be lost when shown something physical.

but i'm sharing these photos as a supplement to the words that follow. i hope they reach anyone who needs them.

the photo on the left is from last summer. i was at a healthy weight. at the time, THAT body was my definition of health.

the photo on the right is from the present day. in the year that has passed between these two photos i've entered a new chapter of my life. 

now my definition of health looks and feels different. i've found new ways, people, and habits that bring me joy. my body has changed as a result of prioritizing my relationships and making memories over getting every single workout in or eating perfectly balanced and nutritious.

watching our bodies change can be hard because it feels like a loss of identity. i had always known myself as one body, which made it difficult to accept a new one. but once i let go of this idea that my body must stay the same over the course of my entire life, i was free to find a new body that served me more.

i've gained weight and my clothes fit me differently and some body parts feel softer, rounder, fuller. i'm learning this new body instead of rebelling against it, because that would mean i'd lose so many good elements of my life. it's not worth it. my life comes first. 

this body isn't better or worse than the body before it‚Äî it's simply a new body, and it's mine, and i'm deeply grateful for the life it allows me to lead. i think both bodies are wonderful because in each i am happy and healthy. the only difference is my definition of happiness and health. this is normal.

i want to normalize our bodies changing and not having to justify it. i want to normalize our definitions of health shifting with the seasons. i want to normalize weight gain in the name of health and happiness. i hope sharing my story can be a step in the right direction for all of us.

my body will change again and again over the course of my life. i no longer fear this, but i welcome it. i hope you can too.

Doc ID: 8642, distribution: 1.0 ; I used to think it was soooo much more complex than this‚Ä¶ but really it can be as simple as DECIDING that this life you want is possible for you.

You don't need to know how.

You don't need to know the exact steps right now.

The first step is to have some mental flexibility to say ‚Äúyes i believe there are possibilities for this life i have been dreaming of‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, the resources and the support I need to get there exist somewhere in the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I think if i really applied myself to it, i could do it.‚Äù

Once you do this, 

Once you have DECIDED that you might be able to attain your desires (which are actually going to help the world),

It will start to unfold because it's meant to. 

Don't just take my word for it‚Ä¶. Try it for yourself and watch what happens.

And prepare yourself for that dream life to start making it's way to you.

You got this. I love you.

It's a combination of:
üó£ the way your parents spoke about their body & other people's bodies
üë• the way your peers spoke about their bodies & others' bodies (which of course comes from their own conditioning)
üì∫ the way bodies are spoken about in the media (on TV, in magazines, on social media, ect)

Growing up, I was surrounded by comments about the human body from people I looked up to, both in the media & in real life.

I became conscious from an early age that my appearance & body was ‚Äúimportant‚Äù & that if I didn't fit that mould of perfection, I would be judged, teased, considered unattractive & unworthy too.

It was only once I started questioning my body image & the conditioning I grew up with that I realised the state of my body image was up to me & I didn't actually agree with what I thought I believed all this time. 

That's why this weekly Real Me Monday series is here, to remind you that:
üëÄ most of us have been unintentionally conditioned with the unrealistic beauty standards we have today
ü§≥üèª social media is a highlight reel
üí° the things you say about yourself aren't factual
üß† you aren't your thoughts OR other people's opinions of you
üòç you can create your own body image, you don't have to hold onto the conditioned views you grew up with (easier said than done, but possible!!)

There comes a time when you've got to ask yourself, would you rather: A. Conform & be miserable on your endeavour to fit beauty standards? Or B. Stay true to yourself & be kind to yourself as you work towards self acceptance & self growth? Lmk in the comments! üßê

There is NOTHING wrong with you. The sooner you realise it, the sooner you'll be able to treat your mind & body with the kindness it deserves üíõ

Just because you appreciate one, doesn't mean you can't appreciate the other. And it's the same deal for each and every one of us. Despite what we've been brought up to believe, there's not just one type of beautiful. 

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that today could be the day you decide to kickstart your health journey to reach your ‚Äúbody goals‚Äù after a weekend of simply ‚ú® ENJOYING YO LIFE ‚ú® and there's nothing wrong with working on yourself, but I'll just leave this here every Monday to remind you that a woman who works out regularly, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle can have belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, and doesn't always look as toned and fit as she may appear online. So next time you question your self-worth when comparing yourself to someone you idolise online, remember this:

If we base our self-worth on something as ever-changing as our bodies, we will forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession and shame. 

So I hope these weekly doses of reality help with that. The more we see normal women with normal bodies, the more realistic our expectations will be, and then hopefully more of us will start to accept ourselves too üíõ

We may not feel beautiful or confident ALL THE TIME, but we still deserve to feed our minds positive thoughts. Self-talk is more powerful than you know. These are a few of the small changes I made when thinking/talking about my reflection:

‚ÄúMy legs are so wobbly‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúMy legs are strong. They allow me to run, jump, lift, dance & take me wherever I need to go‚Äù
‚ÄúI wish my tummy was flat‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÄúMy tummy expands throughout the day because I feed it well & that food gives me the energy I need to be as healthy as possible‚Äù üí™üèº
‚ÄúHow do I get rid of cellulite‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è ‚Äú% of women have cellulite. It's the way our fat cells are stored & isn't something to be ashamed of‚Äù

So next time you're putting yourself down, try to turn the negativity into more positive thoughts like these! Telling yourself ‚ÄúI LOVE MY BODY‚Äù when you don't actually feel that way is probably not going to work... But realistic swaps like these may help you slowly start to love & accept your body!

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right onesüëÅ

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

‚ùåour problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right pathüå≤no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

üôâyou don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people‚Ä¶ who would have known i ‚Äújust‚Äù had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

if you made it this far, what do you think about following & listening to your intuition? what questions do you have about it? drop them down below ‚¨áÔ∏èü•∞

Doc ID: 9457, distribution: 1.0 ; how can you feel like your body is your home if you're viewing it as a temporary place to live?

i'm not anti-having body-related goals, and i believe in body autonomy, but i also think there are a lot of people who use trying to manipulate and change their bodies as a way to try and find self-love and self-acceptance when true self-love and self-acceptance are not things that come from being a certain size or fitting into a certain image or box.

i spent a lot of years at war with my body, constantly blaming my body, resenting my body, and trying to control my body. i viewed my body as being separate from me and something that was temporary. the truth i had to face was that whether i liked what i saw in the mirror or not, i only ever have one body, and it's the forever home to my soul. 

you can't hate yourself or your body into a person or body you love, and the only way to really feel at home and comfortable in your skin is through unconditional acceptance.

loving your body isn't about loving how it looks all the time. gentle reminder that you don't have to love how your body looks to choose to take care of it, be kind to it, nourish it, and accept it.

Doc ID: 2420, distribution: 0.7034824250011981 ; Not all ‚Äúglow ups‚Äù include losing kgs. Sometimes the glow up is losing the weight of the unrealistic & unhealthy expectations you have of yourself. Sometimes it's letting go of society's standard of beauty. Sometimes it's making peace with your reflection & learning that the healthiest, happiest version of you may not be the smallest & that's more than okay! ü´∂

‚Ä¶ Sometimes it's being able to walk into a store, try on a bikini, embrace the dimples, lumps, bumps, bloating & softness in the reflection with a smile on your face, because all you see is a body being a body üéâ

You might feel like it isn't possible to be truly happy in your skin, but I'm just leaving this here to remind you that it is & that smaller doesn't always equal happier & it IS possible to no longer be consumed by unkind thoughts towards yourself! 

In the last photo, I was at a point in my life where I used to take photos of my body every morning to track any small body changes & you'd NEVER find me without my Fitbit on, but you can see in my face that everything at that time was about my body, not my happiness‚Ä¶ 

Life is soooo much fuller & lighter when you let go of the unrealistic expectations you've been carrying on your shoulders all your life. One day at a time, reminders like these will slowly chip away & in a year from now, you will notice the little changes in your mindset towards yourself, your body & food. Small steps every day = big changes. THAT'S called growth üí™

Doc ID: 2502, distribution: 0.5056486884257158 ; For the first  years of my relationship with Dylan, I hid my body away from him.

I hid behind baggy jumpers, long baggy jeans, wrapped my arms around myself in the shower, faced away from him when getting dressed, said no to photos and edited them whenever I did get photos, cried whenever I tried to find the courage to let him see me in my most vulnerable state, but I could never bring myself to. This was something I experienced before and after I'd started my health journey. [ad]

I was so afraid he'd see the ‚Äúflaws‚Äù I grew up seeing villainised in the media: my rolls, my leg dimples, my belly poking out, my stretch marks, my curves where there ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù be and lack of curves where there ‚Äúshould‚Äù be.

He always told me I was beautiful, that he loves me the way I am, but until I loved myself there was no way I could believe someone else would find beauty in all the things I couldn't.

It was only once I addressed my inner-dialogue, the messages I consumed & started questioning what I thought ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù was over the last  years that changed this. Instead of trying to hide or change my body, I have been kinder to it‚Ä¶ Because I didn't want to spend my life punishing my body or mind. Do you?

Accepting yourself doesn't just change the way you love yourself, it changes the way you allow others to love you. It changes the way you live your life. The way you feel, how you think, how much you believe in yourself.

There's such a freedom in showing up exactly as you are, because as small as that act may sound, it's not easy to do. I'm proud that I no longer feel a need to tense everything, suck it all in, hide it away, or change anything about myself. And I'm so dang proud of you, for working on being kinder to yourself too.

I haven't stopped thinking about her words.  I wondered that I had looked in the mirror that very morning and wanted to climb back under my covers and hide from the world (because being aware of patriarchal beauty standards as socially constructed does not make it easier to not internalize them).   I wondered at how loud the fear was: I did not feel particularly confident that day. In fact, I felt scared and unsure about the future and finances and how anything would work out.  I wondered that appearing confident at all times meant to her that the trauma responses or eating disorder urges could not possibly exist in a Confident Body.   I think as a society we have such a limited understanding of mental health.   So here are some of my truths:  #: It's not about my body. Some days I struggle with body image, but some days I do not. It's rarely what drives my eating patterns, but my body can at times be a site of contention when it comes to feeling beautiful. While it's important to talk about it, I try not to center it in my discussions of eating disorders precisely because of the assumption that one must hate themselves or feel fat to deal with an ED. Those can absolutely be symptoms for some folks, but certainly not for everyone and they are rarely the root cause of the disorder.  #: So why do I have urges to restrict? Most often it is because trauma causes me to disconnect from my body, leading to me not take care of my body as I should. When Old Voices come calling, restricting caloric intake is a way to numb out / not feel / be out of my body.   #: Self-love and struggle can both exist. I can feel perfectly confident in who I am as a human some days, but that doesn't erase the struggle of living with c-ptsd or battling a Monster in my mind that tells me to escaping into the foggy haze of starvation again will solve my problems. I can love myself all the live long day, but I still have to learn how to cope in healthy ways with a brain that is a little bit broken (I say that in the sense of a broken leg, just for my brain) from past harm.   (Sometimes I feel like a broken record around this stuff, but I think it can be necessary to be repetitive when there is so much misinformation about there.)

Did you know that Dylan takes all of my 'Real Me Monday' photos? But would you also believe there was a solid FIVE years at the start of our relationship where I wouldn't let him see my body at all?¬†

At the time, it was so deeply engrained in me that I wasn't worthy of being seen or loved the way I was. I didn't want him to see that my body was soft instead of firm, that my legs were covered in cellulite, the way the loose skin on my tummy sagged when I bent over slightly or that my tummy was bigger than my chest.

The issue was never him, or anyone else, it was my own body image & all of the messages I'd taken as ‚Äúfact‚Äù over the years about what was acceptable & what wasn't.¬†

Dylan's always told me he loves me exactly the way I am, that he'll love me just as much when I'm wrinkly all over. But it doesn't matter how many people tell you you are something, because YOU have to believe it for it to have any merit.

Nobody else sees you the way YOU see you. The people who really love you will only see your body as the beautiful, ever-changing flesh sack that homes your soul.

It saddens me to think that for  years of my life, whether I was at my largest or smallest, I really believed that the real, unposed, relaxed, soft version of my body (in the above photos, on the right) were any different or less loveable than the posed, ‚Äúperfected‚Äù, sucked-in version of my body (on the left).

Remembering this time in my life is heartbreaking, but it's also a beautiful reminder‚Ä¶¬†
ü™û You are so much more than your body or the way that you look.¬†
üè° It is possible to create a better relationship with yourself so that you feel comfortable in your skin.
üíó You are not loved for your looks, you are loved for your heart.
üëã It's okay to let go of the beauty / body expectations we grow up around.
üíå Embracing your true self & being authentically you will inspire so many others around you without you even knowing it.

the life we lead in our bodies is far more important than what our bodies look like. a life accented by feelings of strength, capability, security. of happiness and freedom, of light. a life that pulses through our physical being- a life that reminds us we're alive.

how simple. how complicated.

i spent years believing that i'd be happy when i saw a certain reflection in the mirror. i bent over backwards, made myself miserable and my world so small in pursuit of an appearance that brought me nothing but pain. 

i know better now. i know that my happiest, healthiest self looks wildly different than what i was taught is ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. i'm learning to love my new body. because this is the body that has allowed me to cultivate deep and meaningful relationships. because this is the body that has allowed me to skip workouts and say yes to last minute plans and embrace what i can't control. 

after years of pain, THIS is the body for me. i'm truly happy to be here.

but sometimes it's hard for me to see and feel myself in this new body. change can be complicated. yesterday was one of those days- so i spent time in the mirror getting to know my reflection. reminding myself of all the beautiful things this body has allowed me to achieve. telling myself over and over again that i am happy and healthy and grateful and alive. 

body love is a conscious practice. this is me loving mine, slowly, surely, every day.

Social media can be hard & as humans we tend to compare ourselves ALL THE TIME‚Ä¶ so it's important to recognise that if your social media feed leaves you feeling worse, you have the power to change your experience & opt in / out of what you want to see.

For me, I'm choosing to be the change I want to see in the world in the way that I can. I'm choosing to see real bodies in all of their shapes, sizes, colours, features, abilities. I choose to make my feed a diverse & positive experience. I choose to share what I wish I saw more of when I was growing up. I choose to protect my energy & peace. And it's made appreciating my body, believing in myself & accepting everything about myself feel so much easier, almost like it just makes sense ü•∞

Social media doesn't leave me feeling worse now, it makes me feel SEEN, like I can relate to people, be happy for people without their success or happiness taking away from my own, and that there is nothing wrong with my body or any body, because I see real bodies online every single day & I know now that beauty isn't just one thing, it's soooo diverse & unique! I hope posts like mine leave you with a similar feeling & add to your positive virtual experience‚Ä¶ Because our online worlds affect our offline world more than we know üòÖü´∂

Jumping on this trend because I resonated so much with it & thought maybe y'all would too‚Ä¶

Body image is a person's thoughts, feelings & perception of the aesthetics or attractiveness of their body. It's not *actually* about your body, it's about the way you speak to & think of yourself. 

At my lowest weight I still wasn't happy‚Ä¶ Look at that face ü•∫ I was so focused on looking as lean as possible at all costs that I'd completely overlooked what that state of leanness had actually cost me‚Ä¶ I'd forgotten how important LIVING MY LIFE was. I had bad body image days more often than good ones because I was always striving to be ‚Äúmore this‚Äù and ‚Äúless that‚Äù. 

Those extra few kilos I've gained in the photo on the right is the freedom to snack out on sleepovers with my besties, to order what I want from the menu, to not weigh and track everything I eat, to not push myself to extremes in a workout, to enjoy my life to the fullest! It's the freedom to accept my body changing & see myself as a whole person, instead of one body part or flaw.

üö® Disclaimer: this isn't supposed to be a comparison of my body type but rather my mindset now compared to then. It's just that the left photo was taken at a time when I was hard on myself & couldn't find peace with my body. My body image is much better now, not because of my body, but because I'm nourishing my mind with more forgiving, accepting, positive thoughts üå±üö®

Well‚Ä¶ This is kinda different for me üôà but I thought I'd bring my two worlds together: singing AND body image (thanks to ‚ÄúJealousy Jealousy‚Äù by @oliviarodrigo) & since some of you won't even know I like to sing‚Ä¶ SURPRISE! üò¨ 

How many of you have felt jealous while admiring another person's beauty? How many of us scroll through social media and feel worse, or behind, or less beautiful, or less competent, or less successful afterwards? Leave a lil ‚Äúüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äù in the comments if you have.

Around % of people feel jealous regularly & that's why it's so so important to remember that we are all uniquely made & not everything is shared on social media, so comparing someone's online appearance / life / successes isn't a fair comparison. Those imperfections & quirks that you see as your ‚Äúflaws‚Äù are actually the very same qualities that set you apart & make you who you are. 

Let me put it into perspective for you‚Ä¶ When I first listened back to this video, I compared my voice to other people's voices & focused on all the little imperfections, just like a lot of us do with our own body / achievements / talents, right? We always put ourselves up against someone we think is better than us, but if we all looked or sounded or were exactly the same as someone else, all those things that make us who we are would cease to exist.

My voice is my voice. Your body is your body. You are uniquely you & there's so much beauty in that.

So tell me, what's one thing you tend to compare to others & wish to become more confident with?

Here's the first step in me overcoming my comparison & lack of confidence with singing = no professional editing, no professional backing track, just one take of me & my keyboard for ,+ people to see üéπ not gonna lie, I'm nervous‚Ä¶ 

Can we also just imagine if Olivia herself actually saw this‚Ä¶ üò≥ I think I'd simply ‚ú® combust ‚ú®

think about it.

you look at yourself in the mirror every day, probably multiple times a day. you see your features so much that they become boring...or maybe you look at your features so much that you pick yourself apart and feel disgusted by them. the things you do every day - get up, get dressed, exist, maybe have a few interactions, eat, try to do some work, sleep - don't feel all that special or magnificent to you, and you might feel constant pressure to be doing and achieving more.

but, other people don't see you the way you see yourself. i bet so many people look at you and think ‚Äúwhat a beautiful human‚Äù and find you so intriguing. i bet that when you describe what you do for work or for fun, so many people think, ‚Äúthat's really freaking neat‚Äù and want to learn more.

others don't see your perceived flaws as flaws, and they don't deeply analyze all the parts you try to hide unless it's because they really really like them or because they're just projecting their own insecurities onto you (and in that case, it's not really about you). most times, people are too busy worrying about what YOU think of THEM.

can you name someone in your life that you love because of their body, their face, their work, or their hobbies? didn't think so. we love people based on their soul and how they make us feel, and when that happens? we love every part of what makes them them.

So often people joke about ‚Äúgirls on Instagram VS girls in real life‚Äù or catfishing in general‚Ä¶ These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look ‚Äúflattering‚Äù & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat üôÑ

The thing is, you don't have to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù all the time‚Ä¶ ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life‚Ä¶ Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone ‚Äúperfect‚Äù & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own‚Ä¶ Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Instead, what I want to be is KIND to myself & others, CONFIDENT in my skin & abilities, and unapologetically ME; my soft, messy, imperfect, true self.

So after years of putting myself down, struggling with body image & seeking validation from others, I choose to tell myself I am already good enough‚Ä¶ & I carry out my every day life as if that is so. 

I've started showing up as the realest version of myself (right) & not the Instagram-version (left) that I've always felt I had to be, I began romanticising my daily tasks, being my own cheerleader, opting out of comparison, wearing the clothes I never believed I could wear, moving my body for nourishment instead of punishment & saying yes to invitations & things I never would've before.

Beauty doesn't have anything to do with the way the world perceives you. Confidence doesn't come from their opinion of you. Let them think what they think. What matters is what YOU see. Your body is your home. You can decorate it however you like, and if you think it's beautiful, that's all that matters. But at the end of the day, it's the stuff on the inside that counts & shines through.

‚ÄúSelf love‚Äù isn't linear, some days we'll feel bleh & other days great, but being a little more mindful of the messages you consume & the way you speak to yourself everyday goes a long way.

That's what this weekly series is for. To remind you not to compare your life or your body to someone on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with yourself as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that. Feel free to revisit my posts whenever you need them & I highly encourage you to follow more creators who will make your online world feel like a safer, happier place to be! üåé 

Happy Real Me Monday ‚òÄÔ∏èü•πüíó

you deserve to live a really truly happy life, and to do that, you have to learn to let go because where energy goes, energy flows. letting go of anything can be really hard because how things already are may feel safe, and with most loss, there's a sense of grief that comes with it. but, i promise you that the things and people that only add negativity to your life are not worth holding onto, and there is so much life beyond what you're used to that will open up to you when you make the space for it.

in order to keep moving forward, we need to let go of the energy that is no longer meant for us and free ourselves from the chains that are holding us back. your life won't be empty, your life will be open, open to receiving more opportunities, building healthier relationships, creating positivity, receiving calm energy, and becoming fuller than it ever was before.

you deserve that.

Doc ID: 2482, distribution: 0.15225997933496482 ; This isn't healthy‚Ä¶ without THIS! (wait for it)

The ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù mindset is not it. 

Having a sustainable, balanced, long-term approach to your lifestyle is what will last. The key to being truly healthy, happy & feeling fit is to create healthy habits, not restrictions. You don't have to be extreme, just consistent! A healthy lifestyle should add to your life, not take things away from it üíê 

First of all, I've learned that health & fitness isn't what I first thought it was‚Ä¶ It's NOT:
üëâ all or nothing
üëâ eating small amounts of food
üëâ a quick, overnight, easy fix
üëâ working out for hours every single day
üëâ very low body fat
üëâ ignoring hunger cues 
üëâ sweating as much as possible
üëâ weighing myself every morning 
üëâ forcing myself to say ‚Äúno‚Äù
üëâ filling my mind with unkind, harsh, restrictive thoughts about my body, diet & routine

What I've learned is that a healthy lifestyle & werkin' on my fitness isn't actually about a certain body shape, for me it's about the state of my mind & quality of life‚Ä¶ 

‚≠êÔ∏è when I'm taking care of my body
‚≠êÔ∏è creating sustainable habits
‚≠êÔ∏è nourishing my body well
‚≠êÔ∏è allowing it to rest
‚≠êÔ∏è feeling strong
‚≠êÔ∏è accepting that my body has fat & my weight will fluctuate
‚≠êÔ∏è focusing on how I FEEL rather than how I look
‚≠êÔ∏è actually enjoying exercise
‚≠êÔ∏è eating nutrient-dense foods, but also sometimes just eating plain yummy foods that offer no real nutritional value 
‚≠êÔ∏è letting go of guilt & unnecessary stress
‚≠êÔ∏è appreciating what my body does for me
‚≠êÔ∏è saying ‚ÄúYES‚Äù more‚Ä¶ YES let's go out for dinner, YES a hike sounds great, YES I'll have some dessert, YES I GET to workout today (instead of ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù), YES my body has changed a little & YES that's okay! 

That's when I feel my healthiest, fittest & BEST üí™üèº 

Remember, it's not a short-term thing, there's no finish line or end date‚Ä¶ So make healthy choices / additions to your lifestyle that you love & can maintain FOREVER ü•∞

Leave a ‚Äúüí™üèº‚Äù in the comments if ur a healthy queen, do it for the accountability ‚Äî remember it all starts in the mind!! üòâüëë

Doc ID: 9949, distribution: 0.1545642873949596 ; i've been ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù for  weeks now.  out of the  weeks i've been very sick and haven't been able to work out.  i'd be lying if i said i haven't gotten frustrated at times that i've been actively gaining weight and haven't been able to take advantage and simultaneously gain strength when lifting heavy to build muscle is something that i love!  but, it's also given me time to think and put into more perspective (especially after @thewellnecessities's post yesterday) how much of a PRIVILEGE fitness and healthy eating is and the privilege i have that has allowed me to have the lifestyle that i do.
‚Äî‚Äî
i was a figure skater for over half of my lifetime, and after i quit that, i did school sports and danced. now, i am still a dancer, like to frequent the gym a few days a week, and take fitness classes every now and then. i grocery shop multiple times a week for fun and eat out at restaurants with beautiful salads and simply prepared foods.  yes, i prioritize health and wellness in my life, but that's only a part of the picture. the other parts are that my family had the resources to put me into sports throughout my upbringing and the time to drive me, i am fortunate and privileged to not have to worry about a lot of the things other people my age do, i am receiving a higher education that allows me to work in a corporate setting, i have the physical access to do a lot of things, i have the time to do them because i don't work jobs with evening and weekend shifts, and i have this platform (which i probably wouldn't have without time and access) which has provided me a lot too.
‚Äî‚Äî
i've talked about this before, but it's important for me to continue to acknowledge my privilege because while i have to keep track of my daily spending, buy generic brand almond milk instead of the $ stuff, and don't put  adaptogens into my morning coffee, i do still have a lot of privilege and don't have my lifestyle solely because of ‚Äúdedication‚Äù. i want you to know that focusing on what your life requires you to, prioritizing other things, and just doing what you can do in terms of health and wellness even if it doesn't look remotely similar to what you see online is just as valuable üí´

I'd already lost kgs on the left by eating next to nothing, spending an hour on the treadmill  days a week and too scared to eat BANANAS and POTATOES because 'carbs are bad for you' üò≥ (I now eat at least  bananas a day & lots of potato with my dinner every night!!) it's safe to say I was miserable and couldn't keep going this way, that's when I started working with Court from @executefitness__ ‚Äî she pretty much told me to eat more, do less cardio and start lifting weights... So I did, and I lost a further kgs allowing myself to eat more, including all the carbs I avoided before. The middle photo was taken at my lowest weight (kgs)... This much weight loss was NOT intended, it was the outcome of my metabolism being so much faster now, but I'll admit, I didn't realise at the time just how lean I'd become and seeing the weight go down did become something I strived for which really wasn't a healthy mindset. Being underweight also meant sometimes I felt really lightheaded and lost one of the most natural functions of the female body, which also affects bone density, reproduction and so on. So, with hesitation, my new goal became gaining muscle and fat until I was back to a healthy weight again. On the right is  months later, after dropping my training to  days a week, lifting heavy weights, eating at a caloric surplus (consuming more food than I burn per day) & only doing very minimal cardio. I've gained  kilos since making that decision and while that was a scary choice to make, I'm SO glad I did ‚Äî I feel so much healthier & stronger. Plus, it's so fun to watch my body change ‚Äî I now have a tighter tummy, lil baby biceps, shoulders and quads! Being healthy and looking after my body is far more important than being skinny and I really couldn't have learned how to do that without your guidance @executefitness__ & your support @sembarimusic üíõ

what if instead of getting told, ‚Äúyou won't gain weight from one day of eating‚Äù, we were told, ‚Äúit's okay if you do‚Äù? how would that change the narrative? how much less guilt or worry would we feel? how many more people would that help?

just some food for thought because even though i understand the rhetoric behind ‚Äúyou won't gain weight from one meal/day of eating‚Äù and know that it may help some people feel better, i also know from personal experience how harmful and guilt-inducing it can be too.

as we head into this week during that weird period between christmas and new years where it feels extra hard to do anything that's not laying on the couch, here are some reminders:

- what you've eaten recently has nothing to do with what you should eat today
- a changing, fluctuating body is a functioning, hardworking, resilient, and worthy body
- no matter how you feel about your body, you can choose to treat it with care and respect
- your purpose in life is not to keep trying to lose weight until you die
- you don't need to jump on the ‚Äúnew year, new me‚Äù bandwagon
- fresh starts are not reserved for january st
- it's okay if all you've felt like you've done this year is survive

Today, I sat down to have dinner and realized I didn't want my dinner, so I put it away and grabbed for snacks instead. And just ate and ate and ate. And what's so annoying is that I bought the snacks an hour prior when I fully believed I was in a controlled state‚ÄìI just wanted to pop into the store, see what deals there were, and save the food for later.  Lessons I'm taking away from this: . THREE FUCKING MEALS A DAY. Three meals. I firmly believe that if I had just eaten my third meal as planned, I would have been fine. I need to have clear meals or else my brain will use it against me to convince myself to just eat and eat and eat with no end.  . DO NOT GIVE MYSELF THE OPPORTUNITY. I was so close to not stopping at the store on my way home today, but I decided that I was in a decent enough mindset to handle buying snacks and not immediately eating them. I need to take away the opportunity once and for all: I'm committing myself to three meals a day, so there is no need for purchasing bags upon bags of snack food. If I want an occasional snack, I still have plenty of nuts, granola bars, vegetables, etc to eat‚ÄìI do NOT need to purchase crap food.  Deep breath. Tomorrow's a new day. I have to break this habit.

I know it's more than you would usually choose to eat but it isn't excessive in objective terms. Answer: I think that's exactly what I wrote in my post?? That I know it's not excessive overall but it's the out of control feeling in my brain that's awful. Maybe if you've never experienced it, you can't comprehend how horrible it is, or maybe that it's even possible for your brain to go on a rampage that you can't stop. Perhaps you think that's ridiculous, of course you can just choose not to do it. That's what's awful about it, even while a bit of your brain is telling you that, the rest of your brain is away, in the shop, buying the food, eating it as fast as it can. If I tried to explain it with science, I'd say that spend a long enough time with a restrictive eating disorder and survival pathways in your brain open up that decide you will take in enough nutrition to survive no matter what. It's instinctive. And even after you've been eating regularly and adequately for a long time, occasionally the door to those pathways gets thrown open and away your brain goes into frenzied survival mode again.What I want to try and do is build some new neural pathways to get out of that survival mode because right now I don't seem to have a way to stop it other than to hang on for the ride until it's over.

Doc ID: 18319, distribution: 1.0 ; dainty-disgrace:   I think a lot of people forget to talk about how time becomes the enemy when you have an eating disorder. Two hours to a normal person could be excitement getting off work or going out with friends when it can be total, utter agony to someone with an eating disorder. Two hours until you can eat an apple. Two hours until you have to go out to eat with family. Two hours of total panic. A day to a normal person usually means nothing. Work. Hobbies. Or just a day reading a good book. To someone with an eating disorder it can be counting the hours until you get that -hour fast and listing all the things to do just so you wouldn't binge. Just don't binge, you keep telling yourself over and over again. And the day seems to last forever. Three weeks to a normal person go by just like nothing. They go by fast if there's going to be a fun beach trip with friends and it'll be even fun. They barely even think about the passing time. To someone with an eating disorder, more panic, counting the days in agony. Counting how much weight you have to, absolutely have to, lose until that trip. How much weight you can lose in a week? How about a day?  completely obsessive days. You have to reach that gw in that time so you can look good in a bikini. And when it comes, you haven't reached your gw and you cry about the three weeks you just wasted,  days lost, and even if you did reach it, you wouldn't be comfortable enough to wear that bikini anyway. So you obsess about the next  days. And so on and so on. And just like that, time has become numbers too.

‚Äî‚Äî
while i always preach doing what works for YOU, what does NOT work for ME is saying i ‚Äúeat everything in moderation‚Äù because as someone who's an all or nothing kind of girl, the phrase can sometimes be a mask for perfection, and . i don't want food to take up that much mental space, . what does that even mean?, . i don't want to overthink what i'm eating, and . i don't want to feel bad past the initial  second feeling of ‚Äúoh, maybe i shouldn't have done that‚Äù if i mindlessly eat half a jar of peanut butter or more cookies than i wanted, which happens!
‚Äî‚Äî
~moderation~ is something that works for a lot of people and is even something i (subconsciously) practice. but for me, i don't actively think about it, and it's not based on judging food for any more than what it is. i eat what makes me FEELS good when i can which might be chicken and veggies one day and mac and cheese the next, and sometimes i eat what doesn't make me feel so good because i might be prioritizing social interactions, wanting to fully experience one's culture or craft, trying to comfort emotions (not numb them), or even for no reason, which in my opinion, are all okay as long as i'm staying mindful (yes, you can mindfully eat food mindlessly)
‚Äî‚Äî
when i free myself from the idea of ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù, i also free myself from craving and obsession, and i'm able to enjoy emotional freedom, mental peace, and physical comfort.  just your reminder that what terms and practices work for other people, might not work for you, and the only thing you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be compelled to do is take good care of yourselves.

that they swing completely away from eating whole plant foods because it's not deemed by other IE specialists as ‚Äúintuitive eating‚Äù

they start feeling sluggish, unwell, and unhappy that they ‚Äúcan't‚Äù eat the foods that physically made them feel energized and well.

‚ùåbut the idea that their way of eating can't be made up of nutritious foods can't be further than the truth!

there is a way to be in touch with you hunger and fullness cues AND eat foods that feel good to your body

there is a way to drop diet culture AND still eat foods that support your mind, digestive system, and immune system

there is a way to choose cookies when you want to AND choose black bean brownies when you want to

intuitive eating is about trusting your inner body wisdom to make choices around food that FEEL good in your body WITHOUT judgment and WITHOUT influence from diet culture (source: NEDA)

‚ú®salads are allowed here

‚ú®grain bowls are allowed here

‚ú®french fries are allowed here

‚ú®pizza is allowed here

but when and how much of each you want to eat is up to YOU.

this is why i love guiding my clients through intuitive eating after a long life of rules that others have made for them.

there is no one size fits all. you have to be the judge of what and how you'd like to eat. you, as the caretaker, get to make your own rules.

you have the power and the option to choose how you want to incorporate specific habits based on how your body feels before, during, and after.

Doc ID: 13506, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: You suffered with binge eating disorder? How did you get over it? Answer: toethefinishline:
Okay. So I am not exactly sure how I beat it- like there is not a simple solution or anything! And it takes time. You will gradually get better and relapse every once in awhile but hopefully you can get to the point i am at today! Binge free for over a year and a half!
To start I came to the realization that some days I would be eating - calories all of them processed, sugary, non nutritional, gross foods. And before I had the disorder I would restrict, eating no more than - calories per day if even that many. So this was a HUGE change for me! I went from  pounds to  over the  months! And from basically no calories per day to a few thousand! It was awful! And I was trying to look good for my vacation so I told myself every day that today is the last day I will binge- tomorrow I will fast! But each day I would try to fast and be consumed by thoughts of food and eating. And it continually got worse! I remember this one specific instance sitting in my last class for the day that had just started and I craved cheese cake. The class dragged on so slowly and I couldn't concentrate because I just wanted to eat and when I came home I ate the rest of the cheese cake in my freezer and I felt so sick. And I thought ‚Äúokay. the cheese cake is gone so the temptation is gone and starting now I will fast‚Äù but of course dinner came and I found something else to eat! Some nights I would have sugar cravings and I would go to the kitchen get the flour, sugar, vanilla, and water and make a disgusting cookie dough type of thing that was pure sugar and eat it just like that ! it was awful but I just could not control it!
I finally came to the realization that i didn't have to fast or diet or restrict to lose weight. I mean I was eating over  calories almost everyday so obviously if I just cut down to  or  (a healthy amount) i would still lose weight. From there I completely switched everything! All of my goals! I no longer wanted skinny. I wanted fit. I redid my tumblr, unfollowed any triggering/unhealthy blogs and joined the fitblrs(bet decision ever!) And I made some friends and found a weight loss buddy and we made healthy plans together! I made a new grocery list consisting of fruits, veggies, healthy dinners, and little treats. So i would still enjoy myself and not feel deprived. I began exercising again - since i rarely did while i had binge eating disorder. I managed the stress of school by not procrastinating as much and doing my work during lunch and free time in class so when I came home I didn't have so much to do. And I made new goals for myself. I wanted to become a runner, stop binging, eat healthy by choice, become a weight lifter, to be fit, to have abs, and have better endurance. They are all still my goals and I have only completed a few. this all takes time but the good thing is that my binging has ended.
I found that once I centered my goals and my life on health- I stopped focusing on the scale and on calorie counting it helped! The numbers do NOT matter! The number I was concerned with was how many days I went binge free! And don't start by aiming to never binge again! Start small. Go for  days, then , then  - whatever you want! just aim to go longer than you did before!
Why I stopped focusing on the scale and calorie counting: The number on the scale does not matter at all ! End of story. It doesn't measure your self worth or your beauty. It is just a number. There is nothing to it. You need to focus on how you feel and what you eat. I NEVER calorie count anymore because the numbers got way too obsessive for me! I would try to have low sodium, low fat, low carbs, low sugars, but enough calories. and it was impossible! And the days I saw that I had too many of one of those I would be like ‚Äúfuck it! i have already ruined my day so i will just eat whatever i want‚Äù then i would binge! And the days i didn't eat enough I would try to make dinner larger and then it would be huge and awful and it would make me binge then too! So I stopped counting calories!
I just made a healthy meal plan of foods that I should try to eat more often: oatmeal, fruits, veggies, green smoothies, luna bars, greek yogurt, eggs, etc. And I started to make a meal plan. Once I got into the habit of the meal plan it would get easier. Some treats I enjoy are soy ice cream and pita chips- I usually have one treat a day and i don't even portion it typically. I eat what I want and put it away. I figure it is better than what i was doing before and I need to enjoy myself. If you set too many restrictions on yourself you will binge! I tried going vegan but I realized how restrictive that is and it made it really hard so I stopped because I knew I wasn't ready for it and I honestly don't think I am ready even now after so long. I do NOT diet because I know that I will binge. This is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE. You need to be healthy for you and only for you. So you will feel better and be healthier, as a result you will look better too! But you cannot be doing this for the looks! And you need to realize this won't happen overnight! You must be patient and be proud of yourself ! It is such a wonderful feeling going days without binging and you will be so proud and the exercise will make you feel great and eating right will too!
So for main points:
Do NOT count calories.
Do NOT diet/restrict at all!
Do NOT weight yourself.
Find a weight loss buddy.
Drink lots of water!
Treat yourself everyday to something you love!
Set new and healthy goals for yourself!
Focus on being fit and healthy - not skinny.
Fill your tumblr with healthy motivation!
You can even open up to your family and get their help for this! I am sure it would've helped if I had told mine but I couldn't and they still don't know! But they will be able to support you with healthy eating and maybe even find a nutritionist you can talk to!
Also clear out all tempting foods that cause you to binge! I no longer have cheese cake at my house nor do I buy fiber one mocha bars (because my mom would buy them and i would eat one then always eat the whole box. I still don't trust myself with them so I just leave them at the store! Someone else can enjoy them!).
I hope this answer helps! I am not sure if it will - let me know if there is anything I didn't answer or any other way I can help ! I am sorry I kind of rambled but I was trying to cover everything and as I said this is a really hard question to answer!

 One of the shitty things I've learned about restricting is that  
 It leads to binges, but not just because you're hungry. 
It was easier to restrict when you started, want to know why?
Because now you have a hobby that centers around food You don't just get to focus on restriction and not eating, because the subject of food is your life now. 
If you train yourself to think about food all the time, that's a habit now.
 If your every thought centers around what, when, and how you are allowed to eat next, you are going to fail because now your brain is trained to think of food constantly.
The only way to do this without a binge is if you train yourself to forget. Do whatever it takes to forget.
Meal plan (and log) days in advance and have your meals boxed up, day labeled, and easy to bring so you don't think about them as much.
Focus on methods of distracting yourself from food instead of planning around it obsessively.
Again DISTRACT don't obsess
Replace this food hobby you have with all of the better hobbies you'd wish you had. Read, sew, do art, write, do photography, do math or something. Whatever kind of hobby you wish you would do more, do that instead of revolving around food.

If you don't train yourself to stop thinking about food planning all of the time you will binge.

 Do you want to be the kind of person who is talented, intelligent, graceful, well read, and artistic, on top of being skinny? 
 - 
 Or do you want to be that one weirdo who everyone can tell is obsessed with food who seems to eat very little one day and then eat enough for  people and cry about it the next? 
Train yourself to distract from instead of revolve around it.
 Train yourself to stop thinking about it at all or it will come back to bite you as a binge. 
You are what you think about.

Doc ID: 16243, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // weigh in weigh out  I had a big chat with T in therapy about weighing myself. I haven't weighed myself since Christmas. I know I wrote about it at the time, about how weighing every week had started to become unhelpful and just kept my brain fixated on the number. Every week I was hopeful for a little ‚Äúhigh‚Äù as I stepped on the scales. So much intermittent reinforcement. Sometimes my weight would be stable or up a pound, but sometimes I would have dropped a pound and the buzz from that became more and more of a pull. So I went cold turkey with the weighing for a while. It's been a month. But I don't want my weight to be a mystery unknown number, so at some point I will weigh myself again. Maybe the time is now. T and I have talked about weighing myself just once a month to keep an eye on it. She suggested I wait another week, so that it's the start of the month and a time that's easy to stick to on a monthly basis. I think I may have lost weight since Christmas, with all the running. But maybe I have also gained muscle, so maybe the number won't have changed that much. I said ‚ÄúKnowing the number might make it easier to respond to my hunger, because if I have lost weight, I'd realise it was ok to eat a bit more and my body wasn't tricking me‚Äù T wasn't so sure about that strategy. She pointed out,  ‚ÄúThe problem with that is it takes the focus off trusting how you feel in your body, and puts it back on external measures - like the number on the scale.‚Äù  Fair point.

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
coffee and warm drinks to keep me distracted from hunger on those days I was abnormally hungry in the morning. Of course I wouldn't admit that I was "distracting my hunger" but would think I'm "training" myself. most days it was pretty intuitive to eat at the end of my fast‚Äîmy body generally got used to it. but there were some days that I had to sh my body asking for food because I still had  more hours to go. it didn't seem like much of a big deal but now that I think about it, over those months, I said no to my body so many times. i'm surprised it hasn't given up on telling me i'm hungry.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
there's so much talk about intermittent fasting and how it's better for fat loss and that the science shows ______. I don't deny science. maybe it IS effective for fat and weight loss in a way separate from reduced calorie intake.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
But is that fat loss worth it ignoring the wisdom within you? Is it worth creating an unhealthy relationship with your hunger cues? - if that's what's going on with you. for me it wasn't fat loss. I was in the mindset that eating early makes me tired and fasting keeps my mind sharp for work/school. it did... i remember not nodding off in class when i started fasting. it helps a lot of people with focus! but at this point i'd rather be a little less focused at work after eating than ignoring my hunger cues.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
again i'm not knocking IF, I just believe you can still be healthy while listening to your inner guidance no matter what time of day. some days I find myself fasting because I had stuff to do and truly wasn't hungry till later. sometimes I eat at  am because body says ‚Äúfood!! please üëºüèª." If it works for you then great!! It worked for me for a while but I had to be honest with what signals I might have  been sending to my body. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

when i was my lowest weight, i thought i was the healthiest. when i was eating the least amount and the most restrictive, i thought i was the healthiest. but this wasn't health. these were results of me bending over backwards to fit diet culture's definition of health. i ignored my own personal definition of health because for years, diet culture convinced me health was objective- that for every person health meant eating x and working out y amount and on and on and on.

my body has changed a lot this past year. i could spend hours retracing my steps, trying to figure out and pinpoint every little change that could have resulted in weight gain and a new body. but fixation isn't healthy. fearing weight gain isn't healthy.

you know what is healthy? eating foods i love, when my body asks for them. saying yes, even if it means sacrificing control over a situation. showing up in relationships when it's safer to isolate. 

healthy is listening to my body and honoring its needs. i'm still learning to recognize myself in this new body and some days it's challenging. i feel like sometimes weight gain happens right under our noses, unintentional, and suddenly one day we notice it and feel blindsided. i get it. when old thoughts kick in, i remember: 

‚ö°Ô∏èthis is the body that allows me to live a full and happy life. 

i think of every aspect of my life that has improved in the past year, all of the hard yet rewarding changes i've made, and i can't help but smile. we need to change the societal narrative- we need to value how we feel over how we look. we need to remember health is deep.

‚ö°Ô∏èmy health isn't seen, but felt. 

how my body looks will never be worth more than the happiness i feel within it, each and every day.

Living a life full of things that makes you happy > being miserable on your endeavour to look a certain way.

I'm not saying your body isn't important. Your body is this incredible vehicle that keeps you alive & deserves appreciation, but not for how it looks‚Ä¶ for what it DOES!

So often we risk our mental health for our physical appearance.

There's this universal belief that in order to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or look a certain way, you need to sacrifice the things you love. But realistically, by drastically changing your life & cutting out things that bring you joy, won't that just make you feel miserable & restricted in return?

I promise you, your physical body & mental health can BOTH thrive at the same time, it's not just one or the other. You can live a healthy lifestyle without sacrificing things. You CAN eat the food that provides high quality energy for your body & also the food that simply tastes good. You can workout in ways you enjoy, it's not a one-size-fits-all! You can rest! You can embrace your body with all of those beautiful lil things society deems ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù! You can enjoy yo' life!

Please, don't let your body shape or appearance become a higher priority than your happiness. 

Don't be so hard on yourself for not looking a certain way‚Ä¶ Your appearance is the least interesting thing about you üôèüèº

You can do whatever you want to with your body, if you wanna change it, okay then go for it üòä, if you wanna learn to accept it as it is, AMAZING‚Ä¶ I'm not here to tell you one is right & one is wrong, I'm just here to remind you that you can be both HAPPY & HEALTHY at the same time.

i'm human, and even though i am recovered and practice a lot of that woo-woo positive thinking stuff, i still feel sad, anxious, and frustrated sometimes, and every now and then, i still feel some resistance when it comes to my food choices.  but, guess what, the more you eat that food you feel guilty about, the less scary it'll be.  even if you no longer restrict, push yourself and keep eating those things that used to scare you even if you're eating it for no reason.  recovery is hard and confusing, and a lot of conflicting shit goes on in your brain. you want to feel confident and happy and free, but it's hard when you're full of stress and anxiety over making the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù decisions.  but, there is no perfect way to eat or recover, so at some point you just have to do it because although food IS medicine, IS fuel, IS nourishing, it is also just food, and TRYING is better than staying stagnant.

 To all my new anas 
 For the love of god please turn back now 
 This isn't a quick fix to your weight problem 
 This won't help the way you feel about yourself 
 It will literally only make it worse 
 This is dangerous as fuck 
 Like you can actually fucking die 
 And today I felt like I was dying 
 My heart was pounding, and I was shaking violently. I didn't have enough energy to get out of bed and when I stood up I'd nearly pass out. 
 I was laying in bed fucking sobbing because I'd rather be dead than physically feel like this 
 This problem is easily fucking solvable if I just ate 
 But I couldn't because I was going to have pizza tonight 
 And even though I didn't eat yesterday, and had less than  calories the day before, I still couldn't bare to eat anything today because I would be forced to eat pizza with my family 
 Fucking pizza, a food I used to love, gives me fucking anxiety if there's even a chance I'll have to eat it. A food i used to love ruined by this godawful disorder, because all I can think about is how many calories are in a slice (but I have to eat  to keep away suspicious) and how greasy it is makes me want to puke 
 This is not a quick fix 
 This will not help you ‚Äúgain control‚Äù  
 This will not give you discipline  
 But 
 This will give you anxiety 
 This will make you lie to the ones you love 
 This will make you absolutely hate yourself 
 With every ounce of your being 
 And if you go far enough 
 This will fucking kill you


 I'm sorry but this post should have way more fucking notes than it does it's sad that I get more notes on restrictive diets and thinspo posts

Doc ID: 9577, distribution: 0.5000716425241173 ; i've officially decided that if i could only eat one food for the rest of my life, it would be oatmeal...or pasta. something about how warm and cozy it is, how good it makes me feel in my body and my soul when i eat it, and how much i can change it up day to day just makes it such a staple meal for me.

what's really cool about intuitive eating and food freedom to me is how much more in tune i am with my body now. in the past, i saw food as numbers, and there was a complete disconnect between my mind and my body. i used to have  idea what meals would make me feel good, and i'd go into every meal starving and end every meal either STILL starving or absolutely stuffed- there was no in between.

i thought trying to be in control of my body by controlling my food was the way for me to take control of my life, but that false sense of control really made me become completely out of control, disconnected, unaligned, and lost.

sometimes i take how far i've come for granted, make the journey that got me to where i am seem easy, and forget to acknowledge that for a lot years, i lived with constant feelings of self-hatred, dread, hopelessness, guilt, shame, and fear that fully took over my ability to feel in tune with my own body, be my authentic self, and truly live my life.

choosing to heal can be one grueling process (i don't want to romanticize that), but i promise it really does get better. when you make decisions, ask yourself: am i just choosing to listen to my thoughts (that may or may not have my best interest in mind)? or am i truly choosing myself?

keep choosing yourself over and over and over until you feel like you again.

Do you think that you are a good role model for eating habits?(I am genuinely asking and not being facetious because I think you are a good role model especially with going to therapy)  Answer: Wellll‚Ä¶ right now, all is good. I think they only see me with a healthy attitude to eating, exercise and my body. Certainly they have never never heard me say anything negative about my body. I try and be a good role model around food and eating habits. My daughters would probably say that I eat healthily, ‚Äúbecause you don't really eat a lot of sugar and you eat a lot of kale‚Äù. (Honestly that's probably what they'd tell you if you asked!). Which is not what I'm asking them to emulate, we have a lot of varied food in the house which they have free choice to eat (and do eat). That's what I want to be a role model for, being able to make choices about what we want to eat. I think I've set a good path to follow with exercise, because they all understand it's good to move and keep active for our  bodies. We never talk about it for weight loss, only for health and fitness and feeling good about ourselves. We are all pretty active, sometimes separately and sometimes together. Exercise is a normal part of our lives and that feels good.Things have been more difficult in the past when I was more unwell. I still managed to hide a lot of it, but some of it probably leaked out. Never in what I said, but more in behaviours around food.

I look forward to seeing her and then when the session starts and she's there, I can relax into her presence rather than immediately tensing up and feeling anxious. This is a new feeling and I hope it lasts. I spent most of the session sharing with her two big revelations I had over the Christmas period. We are still working through the list of things I had to tell her last week, which was our first session back after the break. I just carried things over and added a couple. Today I had five things on my list to talk about and we talked through two and a half of them. My first revelation - or maybe I should say epiphany, since we are just past that time in the Christian calendar - so my first epiphany was that when I am hungry and I get myself food, I am not being greedy, instead I am responding to my body's needs. I appreciate to anyone with a normal relationship with food this sounds glaringly obvious, but my internal monologue for so many years has been ‚Äúyou're so greedy‚Äù whenever I feel hunger beyond the arbitrary amount I've decreed is ok for me to eat. So to finally shift that to ‚ÄúI'm responding to my body's needs‚Äù is such a massive thing. And I love telling myself I'm responding my body's needs! I'm nurturing and parenting myself when I do that, and it feels good. This revelation didn't come out of nowhere. It came out of a lot of work and real life experience from this year, and before, and then once all the groundwork was done and the path was laid, it was like the new belief was just there, ready for me to step out on to.  As I shared all this with T in session, she was nodding and smiling along. She has been there with me laying all the groundwork and walking alongside me as I processed things before I came to this conclusion, so I don't think it was a huge surprise. But I guess as a therapist, you can never predict the exact session when something is going to just go 'click' in a client's brain.  Faith responds to her body's needs üôå

Now that I allow myself dessert every day, I (for the most part) feel no guilt, which has improved my overall mood and the way I treat myself.

I would categorize foods as being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù and could not enjoy any of the foods in the ‚Äúbad‚Äù category because of the guilt I felt.  Now that I don't have restrictions, I've learned to love all foods again.

Ô∏è‚É£. I had to buy new clothes...because I lost weight üëÄ Shocking, right?  I'm not saying any of you should feel the need to lose weight because no matter what you look like or your body type, you are beautiful, and your body does amazing things for you.  However, I am telling you what happened to me.  In the past when I'd restrict myself, the times that I did ‚Äúgive in‚Äù and have dessert would result in me going way overboard and eating anything and everything for the rest of the day.  If you are trying to lose weight, I'm encouraging you NOT to cut out dessert.  There are a lot of studies out there that show that giving up all dessert leads to extreme cravings, and it is so true that people want what they can't have.  Since giving myself freedom to eat dessert whenever I want, I can feel happy and satisfied after eating just one scoop of ice cream without having it affect the rest of my day's eating.

Doc ID: 9932, distribution: 0.4581859096473108 ; i haven't eaten a full homemade meal in over a week. yesterday, i ate  desserts on top of all my meals out.  the crazy thing about it all? i didn't even realize until last night when someone asked me what i had eaten that day.
‚Äî‚Äî
we'll be back to more usual programming tomorrow (sorry, but not really tbh, if you're tired of seeing pics of me or restaurant food or ice cream or me with ice cream lol), but i've been LIVING, and even though my headspace has been a bit cloudy lately, the food i've been eating never became something that i fixated on.  i didn't even REALIZE that the past week wasn't my ~typical~ eating schedule because even though i LOVE food and everything about it, the amount of mental space eating takes up is so small now.
‚Äî‚Äî
i'm bringing this up because i've been there. where the concept of not thinking about food was UNFATHOMABLE.  i would turn down so many opportunities to go out with friends who i now hardly get to see in the name of hEaLtH aNd WeLlNeSs only to binge in private at home.
‚Äî‚Äî
now? i eat out whenever i want to, don't feel an urge to restrict before or after, order what i want (whether that's pizza, salad, chicken, a burger, etc.), and i sit and ENJOY my meal rather than internally analyzing everything about it. while my life probably isn't what you'd first think of when you first think of a healthy lifestyle, i consider myself ~health and wellness~ because i DO prioritize my health and eat and move to feel good.
‚Äî‚Äî
i'm not against trying to cook most of your food yourself, having a gym schedule, reading food labels, or even tracking food because i think they all have their time and place, but it's important to remember that prioritizing health can ALSO mean giving up your routine, having a social life, enjoying things outside the safety of your kitchen, doing things ‚Äújust cuz‚Äù, and embracing spontaneity.
‚Äî‚Äî
you make your own health and wellness standard, so do what works for YOU.  here's to living our damn lives even when that means going against the grain!!

Doc ID: 2455, distribution: 0.4937916976872285 ; Reminders that have helped me eat more mindfully, flexibly & without guilt üëá

ü•Ø Food gives your body the energy to dance, lift heavy things, heal injuries, fight viruses, stand on your own two feet, to read, think, breathe & be.

üç™ Yes, food is fuel & it's important to give your body good quality food, but it's also for enjoyment too.

üåÆ You haven't ‚Äúruined‚Äù anything by giving into your cravings. In fact, honouring your cravings when you have them will likely help you eat it in moderation & not get to a point where you're obsessing over it & overindulging later. 

üçï Just because food is there doesn't mean you have to eat it all. If you're getting full, you can have a few cookies & put the rest in the pantry, or if you're eating out, ask for a take-away container. Remembering there's no urgency or wastage helps reduce the FOMO which causes a lot of us to keep going until we finish it all.

üçî The human body is amazing, it's constantly responding to what you put into it, including your thoughts! I'd argue that feeling extreme guilt after eating a burger will likely do more harm to your mental health than that burger could actually do to your physical health. 

üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Try eating more mindfully, not mindlessly. To me, eating mindfully is acknowledging my hunger, listening to it, enjoying what I eat & then also listening to the fullness cues that my body sends me when I've had enough.

ü•Ç Just because you've eaten a less nutritious meal doesn't mean you have an unhealthy diet. ‚ÄúYour dosage is your poison‚Äù AKA having too much of anything probably isn't great, but finding that right balance of what works for you & makes you feel good is key!

üçå Eating too little can cause you to feel tired, down, lack motivation & cause your metabolism to adapt/slow down. It's so important to eat ENOUGH, so that you can function optimally!

ü•í Your body IS going to fluctuate & change over the years. It's inevitable. So be kind to yourself. If you want to make changes, fine! But please don't risk your health for a physical appearance. It's your home & the only one you'll have. Treat it well üíñ

Doc ID: 13235, distribution: 0.3530057641726859 ; September here I come
 
 I know, okay I know that binge eating is not solved by restriction, but I cannot gain any more weight.¬† I'm thinking back to the times in my life when I remember having a more normal relationship with food. Half of high school was awful food-wise, but for most of college (except the summer) I really felt like I was cured. I approached food as something I needed to stay full during classes, and dining halls were only open during certain hours so I had three meals a day, of food already prepared for me. And, I walked around a lot‚ÄîI was a lot more active throughout a normal day. I remember still comparing my body with other girls' bodies, and comparing plates, but for the most part, I really just didn't care. I ate to stay full, and I ate only what I wanted (dining hall food was mediocre on any given day, anyways). I was also around friends every day, and was studying and working almost constantly. And I ended college comfortable in my body, satisfied enough with my weight, and relatively stable mentally. The only times I relapsed to bingeing were when I thought that I could try to drop my weight further (usually brought on by seeing other people who lost weight, or being around athletes, as was common at my college).¬† So rather than focus on everything that I've read and watched about how to cure binge eating, I'm going to use my own experiences to tailor a plan for myself for September. For accountability, here are my main goals:  . Have three solid, filling meals a day, with small snacks as needed. Essentially, replicate my college meal plan experience.¬† Breakfast was usually around :, and was a latte and bagel would be similar to lunch, but more substantial, and usually around -pm. More protein, more veggies, but also more carbs like bread and butter, rice, or sometimes pasta. Sometimes I'd add a side salad too. I'd usually still have some kind of dessert, either a slice of cake or cookie or a bowl of cereal.¬†In between meals, I might have an apple that I took from the dining hall, or small snacks like goldfish or dry cereal. But for the most part, that was about it. Looking back, it looks like a lot of food, but a) I was more active then than I am now and b) I regularly eat way more than that in my binges, but I binge on snack food so it doesn't seem like the same amount of food. That's the most ridiculous part: I could be eating comparative or fewer calories now as I used to, but the food could be so much better, and yet my stupid animal brain wants to continually get high off of snacks upon snacks upon snacks. . Be more active. In college, I usually got up to at least  to  steps a day, and some days way exceeded that. So now, I want to make more of an effort to go out and move. I would sometimes go to the gym in college (not possible now, thanks corona), but for the most part, it was just walking anyways.I'd like to get into the habit of occasional morning walks. Evening walks are nice too, but there's more people out and in NYC that makes me anxious. For now, I only go to work once a week, so there's only one day a week where I consistently get to - steps. I can usually convince myself to leave my apartment on weekends, so I try and get extra steps then, but I'm still lagging far behind where I was. So, I need to find a way to get walking into my routine. . Stop bingeing. Stop bingeing for real. I cannot live like this. Food cannot keep occupying my every thought. It's taking up so much of my energy that it's hard to find other things to enjoy and focus on. I cannot keep bingeing. It is not sustainable; it is bad for me physically, mentally, and emotionally.¬†I read through The Fuck It Diet¬†and Brain Over Binge¬†recently. I think both ultimately boil down to getting rid of food restriction and eating adequately and allowing yourself to feel uncomfortable emotions. I plan to reread Brain Over Binge¬†because I'm too concerned about the weight gain that The Fuck It Diet¬†seems to promise (horrible, I know, but maybe one day I'll get over it). Brain Over Binge resonated with me, too, and I think it will be better to focus on the steps that Hanson outlines.¬† . Find new ways to spend time that are not revolved around food, weight, dieting, etc. College was busy to say the least. I'm trying to branch out and find new things to enjoy. It's hard when bingeing leads to depressive episodes which suck the fun and the light out of everything, but I'm trying.¬†Lately, I've been rewatching lots of my favorite TV shows, I've started writing fanfiction (somewhat embarrassing, but it's enjoyable enough), I've gotten into commentary youtube channels, and I'm trying to read more.¬†Some other things I can incorporate into my every day life: applying for jobs, studying for the GRE and LSAT, journaling, writing letters to friends, taking online courses, studying languages, listening to new music, blogging more regularly, drawing, keeping in contact more with friends and family, etc. The limit does not exist.¬† So I guess that's about everything. The thing is, I still desperately want to lose weight‚ÄîI can't keep spending money on insane amounts of food, I can't keep buying clothes in bigger and bigger sizes, and I will continue to self-destruct in worse and worse ways if I keep bingeing and my body keeps spreading.¬† BUT I know that weight loss cannot be one of my goals. I'll hyperfixate on restricting too much, which will only backfire. I have a bluetooth scale, so maybe I'll try syncing my weight with my phone daily, but I won't check anything until the end of the month at the earliest.¬† So essentially, my only goals will be to eat adequately, resist the urges to binge, move my body in satisfying ways, and find ways to make life happier.¬† I wish myself luck, and good luck to everyone else out there on this path !

Doc ID: 9534, distribution: 0.5833935250099513 ; when i first started my food freedom journey, i honestly didn't think i'd ever actually desire eating vegetables because for a long time into my food freedom journey, vegetables just didn't sound appetizing.

backstory: i restricted my food intake for years, and for a lot of those years, i also struggled with binge eating disorder that was perpetuated by restriction (physical and mental) and feelings of guilt and shame.  restriction for me didn't mean that i didn't eat, but rather, i saw the foods i ate in numbers, and vegetables were something i was constantly eating in very large quantities because they simply meant i got to eat more volume. 

when i finally decided to listen to and honor my hunger and cravings, it felt like the only foods i wanted to eat were the foods i would binge on - aka all the things i viewed as ‚Äúbad‚Äù and would restrict - and i was always eating them in what seemed like extremely excessive amounts.

i remember thinking i was becoming an unhealthy person by honoring my hunger and cravings, but i can look back and confidently say that doing so and releasing all expectations of what intuitive eating ‚Äúshould‚Äù look like was the healthiest thing i ever did for myself.

it took time and patience, but now that my body trusts me to honor it, vegetables are a food i actually ENJOY eating, and gentle nutrition is something i'm able to incorporate with no feelings of morality attached.

some days of eating look something like this:
ü•ûüçïü•Øüç®üçùüç©üç´
some days of eating look something like this:

some days of eating look something like this:
ü•ûüçïü•óü•Øüç®üêüüç†üç´

ALL days of eating are acceptable and have nothing to do with my worth.

disclaimer: my journey was not nearly as smooth and easy as this caption may make it seem, and everyone's healing and road to recovery looks different. the point of this caption is that what healthy eating looks like for you may not be what you think it ‚Äúshould‚Äù, and RECOVERY IS WORTH IT.

But you know what my weight is! You've spent all this time helping me gain weight and I'm sitting here with a bmi of  which is not even anywhere near to needing to lose weight! So you should be able to tell me I definitely don't need to lose weight. Even if you can't see all of me!‚Äù I was getting a bit agitated at this point, I think it was the adrenaline of being mid-rant. ‚ÄúYou're right‚Äù T said calmly. ‚ÄúI think it would be helpful if you told me the weights for you that a healthy bmi lies between. What is a healthy bmi?‚Äù Ugh she does this often. I refuse to believe she doesn't know about bmi. And I've certainly told her more than once yet she still asks questions like she doesn't know anything about it. I kind of think she's ‚Äúplaying dumb‚Äù although I don't know for what reason. Surely if you're working with eating disorders you'd have some basic knowledge of how bmi works.  I answer her questions, and then continue on my rant ‚ÄúSo I've got about lbs before I'm even at the top of a healthy bmi range! And maybe if I gained all that, I might find that I had less disordered thoughts. Or maybe I might decide that I wanted to eat and drink absolutely whatever I wanted, and I gained lots of weight but I just decided it was worth it to live my life the way I wanted! I want you to be ok with that, not to be thinking or telling me that I need to lose some weight. I mean, I know you didn't quite say that but you said you couldn't tell, and when you give the eating disorder that space it just gets in there and twists things!‚Äù I think T's mind must have been whirring but she stayed very calm and open. She said she was sorry again that she'd done that, and she was sorry that it meant I'd struggled that week.  I said again that I might find at a higher weight I had even less disordered thoughts, and maybe it would be worth weighing more for my mental health to be better, and I needed T to be ok with that and not be thinking I needed to lose weight. She assured me she would be ok with that and I said, even though I might not feel comfortable weighing more, I might be able recognise that I had a lot healthier thinking there and I'd need her to support me at that weight. T got intrigued by this and started asking me if I wanted to weigh more. I was like ‚ÄúNo no I don't want to weigh more, I just want you to be ok with that idea as a concept‚Äù. Then she was even more intrigued because she felt like I was denying what I'd just admitted to in my rant. She said she would be ok with it and she didn't want to or mean to police my weight. This was good to talk about because I have wondered over several things she's said in passing in the past whether she has ‚Äúthin bias‚Äù and it makes me feel a bit panicky thinking she might not be steady when I really need her to be. To be honest, I don't care if she has thin bias in her own life as long as she keeps it out of my therapy.  Getting all that out in the open felt good. I hope she doesn't forget it.

Doc ID: 16841, distribution: 0.7740796785792663 ; Therapy .. // weight again  We jumped around topics a lot in this therapy session, but that felt ok. We touched on lots of things, but some didn't need more than a touch this week. Just to be brought into the room and left to consider. The first topic we talked about was my weight. I was convinced I'd gained about lbs. As soon as I change my routine or miss a weigh in, I become certain I'm getting bigger and bigger. The new jeans didn't help because they felt tight while I was wearing them in, and my brain immediately equates that to ‚ÄúI'm so fat‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI didn't get to the gym to weigh myself on Sunday evening to weigh myself because we were away for the weekend. That's why I didn't text you it. But I'm sure it's gone up. I feel huge.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ shall we talk about this now?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't think there's much to say. I feel horrible.‚Äù T asks about how my clothes feel. She's trying to help me be more in touch with the size of my body without being reliant on a number on the scale. We talked about eating and whether what I call ‚Äúok‚Äù is the same as what T would call ok. ‚ÄúUhh yep I think you would think it's ok. I'm eating three meals, just struggling with the snacks. I often don't feel good physically though. I know I'm not eating enough and I would be better with snacks, but my head won't let me eat them.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you feel like your blood sugar is low?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah sometimes. And I go in the kitchen and look at the food‚Ä¶ but now I'm not eating peanut butter I don't have anything else safe to snack on.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat's helped in the past?‚Ä¶.[pause]‚Ä¶. Shall I have a go at answering that for you? I think what's helped is knowing that you'll feel better if you eat more.‚Äù I nod. T suggests some things that I have eaten for snacks in the past. My brain makes excuses for all of them. A milky hot chocolate sounds the least impossible. I think because it was T who first got me into drinking that and it feels kind of nurturing to think about having one because T wants me to have one. If that makes sense. We have had versions of this whole weight conversation endless times in past therapy sessions. It only lasts - minutes but it can often be enough of a nudge to keep me on track. And it's good to check in about it each week.  In order to prevent us getting locked in an endless circular debate about eating, T says ‚ÄúSoo‚Ä¶shall we park this for now?‚Äù. I know it, I know everything she is saying, it's good to hear it again and I just need to work myself up to taking some action. So I nod, yes let's move on. I'm grateful to her for managing the session time and not insisting we thrash it out to the end. We have been in that situation before, when I needed it, but I am so much better than I was and so much more steady with my intake. I have to remember that when my intake drops below a certain level, other eating disorder behaviours rush in. Those pathways are in my brain and I'm vulnerable to falling back into them. I just never believe that my intake is that low until I start doing those other things *eyeroll* *facepalm*

AND ALSO CHOCOLATE AND CAKE AND CHEESE BECAUSE I FUCKING ENJOY IT AND THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE ENERGY!!!  sure, i have to make sure that i get enough protein etc. from my mostly plant-based diet, but i'm doing all that FOR MY BODY. not to defeat it and make it look ‚Äúgood‚Äù.  i am still having good and very bad days concerning my body image, it would help a lot if people like him would properly inform themselves before talking shit and commenting on my body. telling me i look ‚Äútoned‚Äù and ‚Äúfit‚Äù and as a result ‚Äúgood‚Äù may be well-intentioned, but what if i wasn't? what if i didn't enjoy rock climbing as much, what if i stopped working out due to whatever reason? my purpose is not to be beautiful, and my body deserves to be respected in any shape it may end up being in! every body deserves respect, health is more important than looks!  sometimes i am thinking about ending this friendship, it brings so much toxicity. on the other hand, i know he is not doing it on purpose. he doesn't understand it. he simply says what society made him believe to be true ‚Ä¶ and he is not the only one. i am SO DONE WITH THIS DIET CULTURE BULLSHIT i swear i'm gonna fight it to death

i struggled with a disordered eating for years, and can say with confidence that the worst thing i ever did for myself was allow this to keep me from being the person i could have been. the person i am now. 

i am healthy and happy and strong. i am free and balanced and accepting‚Äî of my body, my mind, my heart, my life. of the things i can control, and more so of the things i can't. i eat nutritious foods that nourish my physical body but i also leave room for the fun foods, the ones that nourish my heart. i move my body to feel its strength, not to punish or redeem food i ate (and enjoyed!). i accept my body and its appearance with love, with gratitude, every single day.

this week is ED awareness week. i want to remind everyone that struggles with food are not about food at all. in fact, food is simply a medium through which the deeper rooted issues flow. they build up innocently over time, and take everything you have within in you (and more) to heal from. 

the person i was always meant to become was someone with a deep and relentless love for life. i wasn't always her, but i am now, and i can't ever imagine not being her again. life is sweet. i'm thankful. 

sending endless love to anyone struggling in their relationship with food and their body. i see you, and feel for you, and can promise you this isn't the person you could be in this lifetime. there's more for you üíò

you wanna know how to solve your constant hunger and voracious appetite? maybe the answer is to simply eat more. i spent years trying to control my caloric intake of every meal and ‚Äúsave room‚Äù for snacks in between and at night in order to ‚Äúhit my daily goal‚Äù, and no matter what ‚Äúhigh volume foods‚Äù i would eat, i'd ALWAYS be hungry.  i thought it was just who i was- that girl who eats a ton.  while i still LOVEEE food and can easily put down a lot of food, i'm not constantly hungry the way i used to be because i actually eat however much my body is actually asking for and don't question it and just listen and provide what my body is asking for when it wants  dishes to myself at a restaurant or more food an hour after lunch.
‚Äî‚Äî
post-the majority of my recovery and while i was simply trying to ‚Äúbe healthy‚Äù, there was a while i didn't think i was dieting because i was theoretically eating ‚Äúenough‚Äù and felt so frustrated as to why i was still always hungry.  in reality, i was still dieting because i was still ignoring my hunger cues.
‚Äî‚Äî
whether you're formally or informally dieting, if your body is trying to push you off your plan, it's for a reason! so rather than trying to figure out ways to suppress or ignore your hunger, maybe you should respect and listen to your body, its cues, and how it FEELS instead because hunger isn't meant to be ‚Äúhealed‚Äù, it's meant to be fed! and food does that best!

Doc ID: 14737, distribution: 1.0 ; I'd been at my parents for about an hour when I went up to their bathroom and weighed myself. I knew I would do this. I discussed it with T last therapy session. I said I wasn't sure it was a good idea but I was also pretty sure I was going to do it anyway. I haven't weighed myself since February this year and I have been lots more mentally healthier for it. In , I weighed myself every week for the year, and shared my weight with T. So I have a good comparison for how I feel and think weighing myself and not weighing myself. Not weighing myself leads to less obsessing, less thinking thinking about food and how it affects my weight, less body checking. T suggested I write down how I feel before weighing myself. So I wrote to myself: ‚ÄúWhen you stand on the weighing scales, your point of view may well shift, and you will find it hard to find these beliefs in yourself. Other beliefs may try and come crowding in. But these are what you genuinely believe now, so try and trust Past You that she was ok, more than ok, she is happy in this body. Weighing yourself now is just an observation, observing what your weight is in this place where you feel relaxed and ok about it. So you do not need to make any changes based on the number. It is just information. How you feel in yourself is more important, and weight is just a side note. Hold that thought and don't let your brain convince you that it's the other way round.‚Äù Then I wrote some beliefs: ‚ÄúI feel good in my body at this size. I like what my body can do. It's possible I'm even a little too bony. I can eat a variety of things and not controls exactly what I eat. I feel relaxed around food. I obsess about my weight much less. I am tentatively trusting my body that it will not gain weight the minute I stop tightly controlling my intake.‚Äù So. I weighed myself. My ed brain says it doesn't ‚Äúreally count‚Äù because it wasn't an early morning weight. But it will do. I am at the lower end of the range I feel comfortable with. Which I what I would have guessed I think, based on how I feel and my observations of my body. Conclusion. I am comfortable with my weight. No need to change anything.

as i shared  days ago, i binged for the first time in almost a year a few weeks ago. i have said it before, and i will say it again that i believe that binge eating (different from emotional eating or overeating) is a result of restriction- mental or physical. after my binge happened, i decided to get honest with myself to figure out how i'd been restricting when i didn't think i was.

before quarantine, i was eating meals out around  times a week and going out for ice cream at least  times a week. since being in quarantine, i've been doing a lot more cooking.  while i haven't been consciously restricting food since being at home and have been eating more food, the *types* of food i had been naturally choosing to cook - which outside of quarantine satisfy me - hadn't been giving my body the same satisfaction under these new circumstances, and i didn't initially recognize that...leading me to my binge.

i'm not upset that i binged because it was simply my body calling out.  what now? for starters, i've been cooking with more yummy fats, making more desserts, and when i went grocery shopping yesterday, i picked up some denser options. i'll still be cooking a lot of my favorite go-to meals and foods, but i'm adding more variety into the mix to try and help give my what it body wants.

i'm at a place now where i don't feel worried or guilty about listening to and making changes based on the feedback my body gives me, but it hasn't always been this way.  when my BED recovery journey felt hard, i reminded myself that your body knows what it wants, how much it wants, and when it wants it. your body has only your best interest in mind, and not paying enough attention to any one of those things could lead to a binge. note: if you're newer on your journey, know that it takes time for your body to trust you too- respect that.

a healthy diet, lifestyle, and body all look different for different people and even for yourself at different times in your life. only you can really know if you're honoring your body in the moment or not. trust the process, and remember to give yourself plenty of grace along the way.

 so today was supposed to be a rest day, starting off with the good parts i at least made that work. rested a lot, only used my bike to go grocery shopping, no sneaky workouts or anything grocery shopping: i did not panic, bought everything essential, something i have come to be quite skilled at. did NOT manage to buy any of the fear foods i planned on buying. to be fair, the list already narrowed down a lot, ‚Äúonly‚Äù all kinds of sweets, new kinds of bread, actual dairy/not fat-reduced dairy products (funny almost, i have nuts and especially cashews every morning, and it is no bother at all - almost like the thoughts are completely irresponsible), dressings or any sort of premade meals remain a huge struggle. on my good days i can sometimes buy them, which for some reason is way harder than the actual eating part, but today was not a good day - though it could have been worse? for breakfast i had my usual bowl, though i had it later despite being hungry earlier than usual, i kind of postponed it and sat with the hunger, badbadbad trigger. also kept body checking. mhmpf, but at some point i had it and still within late morning. no snack, and what had happened to breakfast, happened to lunch as well. i postponed it and procrastinated eating until i was feeling almost dizzy again, at least i then managed to make what i think was a sufficient and wholesome meal in the early afternoon. when i started cooking it suddenly didn't feel so impossible, i even added extra cheese, big win! but i of course missed out on my afternoon snack as well, i suddenly felt so bad about the cheese and the coconut oil i had used that the thoughts were hitting me quite hard. i drank a lot of water and two cups of strong coffee in the late afternoon, knowing that it'd suppress my hunger and also make me feel sick. now it is :pm and i still feel sick. and i have to get my shit together, go to the kitchen and make dinner, i know, i KNOW. but ED mindset keeps sneaking in, you'll have breakfast tomorrow and just this one time and you did not exercise today. why does it have to be so hard sometimes, always right after a period of eating well, almost intuitively?  it's on days like this when i begin to doubt everything, oh yes. but i can't let myself relapse, not now! food is going to make me feel less sick, my stomach won't hurt anymore, and my body needs food desperately. i have to nourish it, respect its needs, prove that i can be trusted in this matter again. it gets easier, beginning to make food always is the hardest step for me, not actually eating it. and i know, the more often i am going to do this, the weaker it is gonna make my ED. bread vs ED surprisingly, writing this all down here helped me a lot! it seems so much more irresponsible now to not eat than it did before, i know it's probably the emotional stress, but feeling hungry and empty and weak is NOT GOING TO HELP. quite the opposite, actually i think i have mustered up enough courage to go to the kitchen and make dinner now, better late than never, and fuck ‚Äúeating times‚Äù. the right time to eat is when your body says it is, and my body does now. there's this feta creme i was meaning to try ‚Ä¶

‚Äî‚Äî
while i understand that emotional eating can sometimes be an unhealthy coping mechanism (i've been there), food is just food, and it's okay if sometimes you want to eat a certain food for comfort in addition to other healthy coping mechanisms like sleep, doodling, reading, etc.. in my experience, trying to stop emotional eating from ever happening has never worked in the long run, and only ended up with making me feel worse, guilty, and trapped in an emotional eating cycle.
‚Äî‚Äî
last week, my dad and i got into an argument, and afterwards, i was hardly speaking to him. the next day, he texted me while i was at work and asked to go out to dinner with me, and we ended up this little korean restaurant and shared  plates among the two of us. in this case, we didn't even have to talk about the argument over dinner to make up because the eating experience itself was like a bonding experience that allowed us to feel connected again.
‚Äî‚Äî
eating IS emotional. food is not JUST fuel for our bodies to function because it is also a part of our culture, our history, our family and is something that is supposed to give us pleasure and be enjoyed when we eat it.  so many of my best memories are usually not about food itself, but a lot of times there was food present that helped bring me together with loved ones to create those memories. on my bad days, i listen to music, try to go outdoors, spend time with loved ones, and eat my ice cream and pizza, and that's okay because food is just food that is serving a purpose, so i intentionally and mindfully eat it, and then i move on. we are told that emotional eating is a problem, but what's next- emotionless robot eating?

T has done some adoption counselling in the past and so she knows what she's talking about.  We moved on to talking about food. I'd sent T a text the day before, saying I was worried about telling her my weight because it wasn't good. And then a lot of waffle about why it might have dropped so much. Then, in an effort to show I was trying to take some responsibility for it, I sent another text with a picture of my lunch (which always looks like a HUGE bowl of food) and said that I had eaten three scrambled eggs for breakfast because I was not feeling well at all and knew I needed more. T got far too excited by the three scrambled eggs. She said how great it was that I recognised I was feeling unwell and ate more as a result. Ugh, I didn't think it was that big a deal. I have eaten three eggs for breakfast on a few previous occasions.  I sat there facing a resolutely happy T telling me how well I'm doing, while I'm just thinking about how terribly I'm doing. I want her to ask what my weight is, because I'm not trying to hide it from her. I just felt that if I texted it straight out to her, it would be open to misinterpretation as to how I felt about it.

T trying to avoid diving into the food conversation and me trying to get her to dive in there anyway. Eventually she looked at me and said ‚ÄúDo you want to carry on talking about this? We can talk about something else, or do you want to push through with this?‚Äù It felt like she didn't want to carry on talking about it.

She replied that I am greedy is not a good I am statement, and did I have any thoughts on why I might still feel hungry? My head feels such a mess on this. A rational part of me knows why I might still feel hungry. I do a lot before breakfast and I probably don't even eat enough breakfast to replace those calories, never mind to start the day. But I just can't connect with that thought. Much stronger is the thought that I'm eating three meals a day and snacks and surely that should be enough!!! so why is my body still greedy??? and wanting more!!! and why can't I just eat like a normal person and not be hungry???

We sat like that for a few minutes, and then T said ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ what happened there?‚Ä¶.

For me there is probably a somewhat blurry overlap between the two. T asked ‚ÄúWhat do you need from me now to help us support you to stay healthy when the babies arrive?‚Äù I said (eventually, when I could get the words out) that I just needed her to start from a place of it being genuine lack of time, rather than jumping in and assuming it's eating disorder driven right from the start.

But how about this, I will not ask about how your eating is going, if you will agree that if you feel like you are struggling, then you will let me know‚Äù I nodded. She carried on ‚ÄúWe do need to know that you can learn to manage yourself in situations like this, so that when we stop working together, you will feel safe to negotiate life without falling back on your eating disorder.

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year now, and he's put on a substantial amount of weight in that time. I have brought it up to him, because I care about his health and want him to minimize his risk of developing health conditions later on. He is willing and on board to make changes, and I have been careful in how I phrase things to him because the last thing I want to Answer: do is make him insecure about how he looks when that's not what it's about.

So help, what do I do?!‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîHi anon, ooh that's a really tricky one. We can't make other people change, no matter how much we want them to for however many very good reasons. I think you may have to decide if you can make peace with being with your boyfriend no matter his shape or size. Because you can't have a serious long term relationship if it's conditional on either person to continue looking or staying the same as when you first got together. I hear your concern for his health. Could you try and take up some form of exercise together? Go for walks, runs or cycle rides or join a gym etc etc. Some way of being active together that would improve his fitness? Is there anything in your lifestyle together that you could alter that would benefit both of your health? For example, the food you cook together, the snacks you buy, the places you eat out, the amount of alcohol you drink? Little changes that are sustainable can make a big difference.From a personal story, my mum has spent  years trying to get my dad to lose weight and it has never worked. I really don't think it's been helpful for their relationship either. Plus it screwed up me and my eating. I would suggest maybe think about all the things you really love about your boyfriend, and decide if those are enough to hold your relationship together no matter what other things change. If your boyfriend is *wanting* to lose weight and get fitter but doesn't know how to start, that's slightly different. I would say he needs to hook up with people who can motivate him, keep him accountable, encourage him, educate him, exercise with him etc etc Does he have friends who could do this, or maybe a few sessions with a personal trainer? Join a beginners running club or walking group etc whatever would help him stick to his determination. I'm just throwing out ideas there. You can help him research or join groups with him, but I think the main motivation has to come from him else it's unlikely to work.Hope that helps,Best wishes x

I just tended to avoid the carbs, although I always had some bread. I said I hadn't found the eating difficult, I was always full after meals, and I hadn't felt like I was obsessing over food between meals or feeling unwell or any of the other things that tend to happen when I'm restricting. I told her how it got harder when we came out of the desert because maybe I had gradually built up a calorie deficit and my body was trying to catch up now more food was available. I tried to explain how awful and out of control it feels when my brain and body are working against each other, even if I kind of know what's going on, it's hard to trust either my brain or my body, and I end up having all sorts of urges. At least I could honestly say I hadn't been purging (vomiting) despite having a lot of thoughts about it. The main thing that stopped me is that I haven't done it for so long now that I would be so mad with myself if I took that massive step backwards, and I know it would start a downward spiral. It's just shameful to think about it afterwards though and think how tempting it felt. I did manage to confess rather shamefully to what I'd ended up doing (chewing and spitting) and how things were a bit rough but I figure I just need to ride it out and I will come through it and back into a settled pattern of eating soon enough [which a week later, I have] We got through all that and to a bit of a pause, and after a bit of silence T said ‚ÄúDo you want to keep talking about food or do you want to talk about something else?‚Äù I thought for a bit and said that I didn't think that I had anything more to say about food but I wasn't sure what else to talk about. ‚ÄúBecause you have too many options?‚Äù T asked. ‚ÄúNo, I just don't know what to talk about.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ so we could talk about what is happening with d‚Ä¶ or we could talk about your letter to your mum‚Ä¶‚Äù

I also never liked the sea that much either. All the fish, jellyfish and goodness knows what else in the water that I could never see always freaked me out. I would completely flip each time I'd first get in (and provide very good beach entertainment too üòÖ). -year-old Holly was even content simply just seeing photos of the underwater world, and always said I'd never want to see it myself.

But ok. So here's the thing. I'm now a qualified PADI Open Water Scuba Diver, and as I said, it's total madness to me. Besides dancing, learning to dive has been the most rewarding skill to master and I even want to take it further. I genuinely cannot wait to be back swimming with the fishes ... and sharks ... and turtles ... (if you saw the vlog, you know) üòè

And yes, the Great Barrier Reef is beautiful. Waaaay way better than the photos üòâ. Enjoy this little montage of Holly in her scuba gear, and again, I want to say a huuuge thank you to @divers_den for being incredible. If I ever return to Australia, I want to be back on the Ocean Quest in Cairns without a doubt, and if you guys want to learn to dive, please check out their tours. For reference, I did the -day course (a gifted experience) which includes your scuba theory, pool work,  training dives and  dives when you qualify (including a night dive) ü¶à It's also the only company in Australia offering up to  dives a day!

We spent quite a few days here on Koh Lanta because the island was such a vibe with amazing vegan food spots, it was perfect for exploring on scooters as newbie riders . . . aaaaand we were both exhausted and a bit ill (updates in vlog, episode ) üòÖ It also meant I could finish the Climate of Change podcast, which I'd been listening to on my travels in Thailand as you guys know üëåüèª
-
Especially in the developed world, it can be all too easy to gloss over the realities of climate change because we aren't (yet!!!) feeling the effects, unlike other parts of the world with less money, resources and knowledge. Listening to podcasts like this, however, always sparks me to use my voice and this platform to talk about things I feel very strongly about.
-
From learning about the use of drones to improve the efficiency of power lines to looking at how we can 'gamify' energy saving behaviours, I've really loved the  episodes!! It's been filled with really insightful interviews, incredibly cool music by Imogen Heap and biologist, Dan O'Neill, and very current facts and statistics. Apparently %, I repeat *seventy-percent*, of teenage girls are ashamed of wearing the same clothes again !!! üò≥ Please please please, for me and the planet, love and wear your clothes over and over again üôèüèª The world of Instagram needs to see it!

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok üòè).

Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! üòÖYou cannot win with British people I'm afraid.

I have very mixed feelings. A bit stressed. Anxious. Nervous. But I am just trying to go with an open mind.

Short answer: YES ü§© But let's add some context first! So Koh Tao is where most people come to dive in the country. Thailand is also the second cheapest place in the world to dive, so I'd highly recommend you try it if you're travelling in Asia üåè

First Australia, then Thailand, a short trip to Edinburgh and now finally on to exploring Germany (and elsewhere üëÄ) . . . I think it's safe to say that travelling has taught me so so much and I definitely think you can see how much I've changed (in a good way, of course üòâ).

 years ago I would never have done anything like this. It wouldn't have been on the to-do list. Not boarding a flight and losing money would have been a definite no no, and backpacking with friends I've met whilst travelling would have never. even. crossed. my. mind!!!

Having conversations with people in the language you are trying to learn is probably the best way to master it quickly, and obviously visiting the country would be ideal. However for me, going to Germany isn't feasible at the moment, so instead I'm going to exploit the power of the online world.

-
Before I arrived in Australia, this was one of my biggest worries on my itinerary. And that might sound surprising, but it was because the thought of going on an unguided -day road trip with people I'd only just met really made me feel quite anxious. And because the trip hadn't been booked in advance, unlike the rest of my travels, I was just getting super stressed (Darryl, you'll know üòÖ).
-
When I then arrived and completed my first tour with Welcome to Travel, of course the homesickness hit with full force and I did feel really overwhelmed. It has also taken time to settle down a bit too. Hence, I felt a lot more comfortable booking a guided tour. I did the -day trip with Wildlife Tours, which takes you all along the 'greatest ocean road in the world' (can confirm, the scenery and landscapes are amazing!) and then into the Grampians. It totally exceeded my expectations and I met some incredible people: definitely people I'd now call friends üôåüèª
-
I am trying to make sure that I include all my first impressions, thoughts, feelings, worries and anxieties in my vlog series, because I think it's really important to just show you that I am a real person. I struggle a lot in social situations, especially in novel contexts, and solo travelling in really pushing me out of my comfort zone. I am also doing a lot of things for the first time, which is craZy üò¨ ... and a lot of them are honestly CRAZY things that I never, ever, thought I'd do üôà

This is something that's been playing on my mind a lot recently, and wowwwwww I cannot tell you how much truth I believe it has.

AND: what would've happened if I'd accepted my first job offer and started a full-time contract teaching biology in the UK last year? Again, I wouldn't be here travelling and this has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Period.

They're technically not mountains (and if anyone disagrees, Glenn is accountable üòÖ). The ‚Äúblue‚Äù part in the name, however, and again as we were told, does hold truth in that the eucalyptus oil that seeps out from the gum trees creates a blue mist visible in the distance when it mixes with air.

üåü SOLO DATE DIARY # üåü 

The reason I started taking myself on these solo date adventures is because I'd always lacked confidence. I was the -year-old without a license or job, relying on my mum to make doctor's appointments for me because I was too afraid to make a phone call. But I knew that version of me was being held back by my fears‚Ä¶ So now, at , I've decided to start dating myself. It was my way of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into situations I'd usually avoid, to prove that . I can enjoy my own company and . I WILL grow into my happiest, most confident self ü§ù

Remember, the person you want to be is already within you, otherwise you wouldn't want to be that person. The person I AM is confident, kind, spontaneous, motivated, compassionate, isn't afraid to order what she actually wants to eat off the menu, makes friends with strangers, doesn't care what people ‚Äúmight be thinking of her‚Äù, she can handle awkwardness & she's proud of who she is! üí™üèº 

In the past I've taken myself to a theme park, the cinema, the arcade, random cafes, the beach, sunrises on the lake, the library & so on‚Ä¶ Ahhh, there's so much fun to be had in your own company ü§© would anyone want SOLO DATE DIARIES to become a thing where I take you along each time? Leave a ‚Äúüëèüèªüëèüèª‚Äù if so!

Let's get to know each other‚Ä¶ Introduce yourself! ü•∞ Who are you? Where are you from? What do you love? & Where would you take yourself on a solo date? Lmk below! üíõ

Doc ID: 11261, distribution: 1.0 ; Times Square by night üí• .... is still super busy, but it looks even better than during the day all lit up in the darkness. 
So we stayed pretty much on Times Square and if you watched my story you'll know we were lucky enough to see two shows on Broadway: The Book of Mormon and Kiss Me Kate. I recommend them both for sure. The Book of Mormon, whilst very funny, is incredibly rude at times (most of the jokes I don't even get üòÖ) and the dancing is Kiss Me Kate was one of my favourite aspects of the show. If you're looking to get cheaper tickets and good deals I recommend the app @todaytix which we've used for a very long time (this is not sponsored at all, but you guys need to app if you love theatre). We used it to book all our tickets in New York, and even got the ones for Kiss Me Kate on the day of the show! 
I'll be starting to edit today but wow we have a lot of footage! There will probably be more than one video and I'll see how far I get with it today (but I think it will take longer than expected). Also, yes we're now back in the UK üò¢ We only booked to stay for four days, but I think it is a good amount of time to see and do a lot of things in the city.

We left Koh Tao, where we did scuba diving with @lbdivingkohtao (episode  on YouTube), and travelled back to Bangkok. Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I'd recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I'd organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map üòÖ)!

Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani üò±üò≥ Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive üòÇ But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today's vlog on YouTube (episode , live @ pm) üòè I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it!

I danced for my life with some of the most incredible people at uni, smashing competitions and beating Oxford (sorry not sorry) at varsity. Exam season was the toughest one yet, losing the most incredible dog Star in the middle of it, but we somehow still finished the year with a First. We hit K subscribers on YouTube, which I honestly still can't believe, and launched Narna with my number one dude after a year planning it all out. I marched for Animal Rights again with thousands and thousands of other vegans in an ever-growing community, ate some epic plant food, watched myself in a documentary and gave my first ever mini-talk at Perse Sixth Form. Building amazing friendships with some incredibly like-minded people has been a memory for sure, and coming home with two crazy puppies with Mum (the little devils you know as Bali and Java) was probably the most spontaneous decision of the year. Applying for Grad Med was also a very last minute decision, and although we were rejected after a crazy MMI interview, I am so grateful for everything I am learning from such a big knock-back.

i hope amongst all that you are constantly doing that you remember to also BE (you are a human BEing after all), TAKE BREAKS, and NOT TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY. for me this week, that meant putting down some work that was stressing me out, putting on an outfit i felt cute in, and taking the time and energy to go out with a friend and catch up over happy hour drinks, food, and bowling at @punchbowlsocial! #ad

@punchbowlsocial is back open in the flats at east bank, and they have a great happy hour at from -pm sunday and wednesday-friday. the staff did a great job at making the space a safe environment to dine, drink, and play games with wearing masks, regularly sanitizing the game and activity areas, and ensuring social distancing. if you are comfortable with going out right now, i would definitely recommend going!

Ok why do I always end up on the subject of weather? Maybe I secretly love it, who knows. But anyway, my words of wisdom for the day as as follows . . .
-
Sometimes and on some days I'm an expert at not caring too much. I couldn't care less if people think I'm strange for not doing anything crazy with my hair everyday and leaving it to frizz out of control. The way I drink 'hot lemon' is how I like it, and I seem to enjoy looking like a moving red traffic light because that's apparently my jam üö¶
-
However, on other days and when my mind only seems to crave negativity, any excuse to feed off the opinions of others is too hard to cast aside. Should I not be drinking brown smoothies? Was @hollygemia a bad idea? I'm , Holly should you be looking for a relationship?
-
Now I haven't got a solution to this. But all I can say is: everyone is different and living their own best life. Something that works for you, will not work for others, and you have to always remind yourself of that. Having put my life online for a good few years now, I've come to accept that people will nick pick at the things you do and question . . . everything! But again here's the reminder: don't waste your time or energy on worrying about what other people think.

She expected me to run a mile from the idea, but actually I would really be up for something like that. Not because our marriage is in trouble or at risk of breakdown, but just because it could help us communicate better and tune in to each other again. After all these years of therapy, I understand myself much better and I've changed a lot, and I don't think H has really been with me on that journey. We still work very well together practically as a team, but we don't have much time in our daily lives to connect emotionally. When we do have down time, we both are more comfortable just relaxing in our individual worlds. I said to T that I would need it to be not another thing that I am the driving force for, that I am pushing H into. Because then when I'm tired or feel like I can't be bothered with it, I would need H to be encouraging me to do it rather than feeling like he's got a night off from it.  I love love love the idea of being able to feel more connected and more open with H about what's going on for me, but I do not love the thought of the work that would have to be put in. Especially as the prospect of therapy coming to an end is out there, I would like to transfer some of my attachment to T onto H, but I can't. I just don't trust him to be a safe person for my emotions, and the thought of doing the work to build that trust feels uncomfortable. Maybe it's something for some point in the future, if life ever calms down enough.

Doc ID: 12113, distribution: 0.06299954270089951 ; mirithebrave:  Also - screw it - while we're talking about treatment experiences, here's my review of Renfrew (the Brentwood, TN location). Prepare yourselves, it's bad. This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).¬† A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.¬† On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian¬†counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode. I'm sure she was great therapist and very skilled at her job, but because of my religious PTSD, my brain coded her as unsafe and I was unable to talk to her or open up.¬† I told them I couldn't work with her - I tried to advocate for myself because I know my brain.¬†The psychiatric provider told me I needed to learn to work through that and that that was the actual issue, that I needed to learn to work with Christian therapists. SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT after I had just said that I grew up in a Christian cult and have PTSD from that. My issue was not the harm they caused, but being unable to work with Christian therapists‚Ä¶ Well about  weeks into my stay, I have a breakdown because I've been off my antidepressants for weeks and no one has been monitoring my meds. I asked - no, BEGGED, to talk to someone because I was feeling desperate. The therapist on site told me that ‚Äúmaybe now just isn't the best time for treatment‚Äù and maybe I needed to hit rock bottom first. I walked away feeling even more desperate.¬† The entire time when I was struggling with trauma symptoms (dissociating a lot, having panic attacks) I was told that I was being avoidant and resistant and just wasn't motivated enough, even though I was giving it all I had.¬† A friend of mine, another patient, was literally sent to a room by herself when she couldn't finish a meal, even though that replicated traumatic punishments she had as a child (she told me all of this and I told her if they made her do it again I would come sit with her so she wouldn't be alone).¬† They don't teach coping skills either? Everything is labeled avoidance (music, writing, any¬†‚Äúhealthy‚Äù coping skills is avoidance unless you just sit and feel the emotion). That may sound innocent enough until you bring trauma into the equation, in which just¬†‚Äúsitting with‚Äù the traumatic emotions / thoughts is not how you heal and in fact may be re-traumatizing.¬† I was also constantly made to feel like I was the problem. The approach was extremely punitive. One of the head dietitians, who was not on my team, threatened on my second to last day that if I didn't finish a meal, they might discharge me early. I told her I was about to discharge in two days, and she said,¬†‚ÄúWell, we might make it tomorrow instead.‚Äù I was already anxious enough, and I don't respond well to¬†ultimatums or threats (who does?), which were really common there.

 I found my old treatment plans from Renfrew: ‚Äúclient presents with an avoidance of vulnerable emotions; is quick to anger to feel a sense of power‚Äù   okay. I have PTSD; avoidance is LITERALLY one of the diagnostic criteria for that. As for anger, I wasn't being heard & was shamed at every turn for trauma responses. My anger was self-protection & survival. Any clinician worth their salt would approach that with compassion. oh, but this next part: ‚ÄúClient endorses trauma response to one staff member she has ‚Äúcoded‚Äù as unsafe.‚Äù  Yeah, see my brain did not *choose* to code this staff membee as unsafe. She was connected to things associated with my trauma. That was mocked. Anyway, fuck Renfrew.

My adult self knows that the next two weeks over Christmas and New Year will go super fast and I will not miss therapy particularly. I'm securely attached enough to T that I can feel the connection with her even when I don't see her, plus I have little strategies to boost that connected feeling such as I can look on WhatsApp and see when she was last online, and I can read her past messages to me, and I have the bowl she made me (which I dithered over bringing away with me but didn't in the end - I didn't want to have to explain it to anyone else who saw it and I was also worried it might get damaged in transit). T asked me how it felt going back to stay at my parents house after everything we'd just talked about. I thought about it. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶. uh I think I will feel a bit more separate from them. And a bit more adult‚Äù. T and I have talked recently about my mum and I being quite enmeshed. Not in the typical way I would think of enmeshed as being, but more in a way of me continually trying to align my thoughts and beliefs alongside hers. A sort of virtual enmeshment maybe. Now I'm facing the reality that there was emotional abuse going on and my mum did not stop it.  My parents are really coming off their pedestal as I realise more and more not only were they not perfect but they actually got some things very wrong.

Doc ID: 12303, distribution: 0.0648508501950895 ; Also - screw it - while we're talking about treatment experiences, here's my review of Renfrew (the Brentwood, TN location). Prepare yourselves, it's bad. This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).¬† A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.¬† On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian¬†counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode. I'm sure she was great therapist and very skilled at her job, but because of my religious PTSD, my brain coded her as unsafe and I was unable to talk to her or open up.¬† I told them I couldn't work with her - I tried to advocate for myself because I know my brain.¬†The psychiatric provider told me I needed to learn to work through that and that that was the actual issue, that I needed to learn to work with Christian therapists. SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT after I had just said that I grew up in a Christian cult and have PTSD from that. My issue was not the harm they caused, but being unable to work with Christian therapists‚Ä¶ Well about  weeks into my stay, I have a breakdown because I've been off my antidepressants for weeks and no one has been monitoring my meds. I asked - no, BEGGED, to talk to someone because I was feeling desperate. The therapist on site told me that ‚Äúmaybe now just isn't the best time for treatment‚Äù and maybe I needed to hit rock bottom first. I walked away feeling even more desperate.¬† The entire time when I was struggling with trauma symptoms (dissociating a lot, having panic attacks) I was told that I was being avoidant and resistant and just wasn't motivated enough, even though I was giving it all I had.¬† A friend of mine, another patient, was literally sent to a room by herself when she couldn't finish a meal, even though that replicated traumatic punishments she had as a child (she told me all of this and I told her if they made her do it again I would come sit with her so she wouldn't be alone).¬† They don't teach coping skills either? Everything is labeled avoidance (music, writing, any¬†‚Äúhealthy‚Äù coping skills is avoidance unless you just sit and feel the emotion). That may sound innocent enough until you bring trauma into the equation, in which just¬†‚Äúsitting with‚Äù the traumatic emotions / thoughts is not how you heal and in fact may be re-traumatizing.¬† I was also constantly made to feel like I was the problem. The approach was extremely punitive. One of the head dietitians, who was not on my team, threatened on my second to last day that if I didn't finish a meal, they might discharge me early. I told her I was about to discharge in two days, and she said,¬†‚ÄúWell, we might make it tomorrow instead.‚Äù I was already anxious enough, and I don't respond well to¬†ultimatums or threats (who does?), which were really common there. All of that to say: they are NOT equipped to treat trauma, no matter what they advertise.¬† EDITED to add: I've written reviews on Yelp and Google, if you want to¬†‚Äúlike‚Äù them ;)

I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said ‚Äúoh I was thinking‚Ä¶ at the end of last year‚Ä¶‚Äù then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly ‚ÄúBut now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶. okayyyy‚Äù in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added ‚ÄúMaybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about‚Äù. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

She also said she had supervision today and now she was excited to have something really good (my progress) to share. I have mixed feelings about that. On the surface I'm happy that she can share how well I'm doing and that I know % it is down to her help that I'm in this place, so I'm really happy and pleased for her to take that to supervision. On the other hand though, did that mean that she didn't have anything good to share before this? Was she going to go to supervision and rack her brains for what to say‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúUh yeah Faith is still having the same old same old conversations with me about eating cake‚Äù and her supervisor would be like ‚ÄúCome on T, you have to move her through that‚Äù  I'm probably overthinking. I hope her supervisor was happy too and told T what a good job she was doing and that all the struggles with me were worth it.

I was not making eye contact with T but I was facing the screen enough that I could see her when she shifted position. I become very aware of my own blinking when I'm frozen like this, I guess my eyelids are the only part of me that moves. It's not going to be a very accurate account of what happened from here on because it's a bit hazy and I'm piecing it together from snatches of memory. T may or may not have asked me what I was thinking, but eventually I managed to rouse out of my frozen state enough to say ‚ÄúMy mind is all blank‚Äù. T said ‚ÄúMmm yes, you're having a freeze response, like in fight flight or freeze. Would you agree?‚Äù I nodded.  ‚ÄúSome part of you feels like it's not safe, what I just said?‚Äù she continued. I nodded again. Once I've moved out of the totally involuntary freeze state, it's hard to force myself to unfreeze further. Most of my brain wants to stay there, it doesn't want to make the effort to come back to the present. I have to really work to make myself focus and speak.  I don't know what got said in what order after this. T said if you keep someone dependent on you when it's not needed, then that's abuse, not comfort. I'm not sure why she said that, other than she's trying to tell me I need to be less dependent. Except I think I *am* less dependent than I have been, so I don't get it. And I'm not going to stop depending on her entirely because I'm paying her to be my therapist and I'm not going to turn down her support while it's still there. I don't want to look back when she's not my therapist any more and wish I'd made full use of her support when I had it. T mentioned that I had brought up ending therapy before, and so she knew I had thought about it. I dredged some words out of the back of my brain and muttered ‚ÄúI don't actually want to end therapy after all‚Ä¶.. I'm just going to stay forever and ever.‚Äù  T said ‚ÄúThat's very brave of you to say that. Thankyou for being brave enough to say that.‚Äù I flickered my eyes over to make eye contact and then looked away again. T said ‚ÄúThere might be a bit of a problem with staying in therapy forever with our ages, as we both get older.‚Äù I felt like I didn't care about that. I don't have a solution to it but I don't need a solution right now. Right now I am here in therapy and that's where I'm staying.

Doc ID: 14452, distribution: 0.4448425601087516 ; Question: Hey! Just wondered how long it took you to get to the point where you could have an honest conversation with your therapist when she's done something wrong or something you're not happy with? I've had two therapists (over about  years) and never really got to that point at all, I feel like I've failed somehow - I so wish I had the open communication you and your therapist seem to have!  Answer: Hmm it took a while, and it was very much led by my therapist. She taught me how to do it and basically talked me through the process multiple times. It's definitely not something I would have learnt to do without her help, so please don't think you've failed. My therapist is really big on the therapeutic relationship and how that is the tool for change, but another therapist who works differently might not take the relationship in that direction.Honestly when I started therapy, I could barely speak in session I was so anxious. It is not my natural personality at all to tell people how they've upset me, and if my therapist hadn't been so encouraging and open and gentle, I wouldn't be able to do it at all. Now I can tell her if she's upset me, but there was a long period in the middle years of therapy, where I would just go to session and shut down if I was upset or hurt, and it would take so long for me to be able to let T know what was going on. I think early on I used to tell her by text because it was easier than talking, so I feel lucky that she allowed me to do that.

T asked me if it brought things up for me, talking about d leaving home and going to university. I said I found myself thinking that d was so young, only just turned , to be trying to cope with university in the time of Covid. And then I caught myself thinking that by d's age, I'd been at university coping for a year and a bit - albeit not with Covid as well. T asked me what feelings it brought up. I paused. This is all a valid thing for us to talk about, but I'm not ready to move on to university years yet. I'm still processing the primary school years. This has happened before, T starts to take the conversation in a different direction to where I thought it was going to go. One time after I'd gone along with her line of questions and then got upset about using the time time to talk about that and her not picking up what we'd been talking about the previous session, she said to me ‚ÄúFaith this is your time, you can choose what we talk about‚Äù. It was empowering.  I learnt that I can redirect the conversation to what I want to talk about. For a people pleaser like me, who used to be too scared to state my own wants because I always felt like other peoples mattered more, this has been such an important lesson. So I said, ‚ÄúCould we come back to this topic later?‚Äù  T nodded, ‚ÄúOf course‚Ä¶ where would you like to go?‚Äù She always gives me a positive experience of expressing my own wants and needs. I love that.  I said something about going back to what we were talking about last session. I briefly got stuck inside my head, phrasing and rephrasing what to say. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ so I've been thinking about what we were talking about - about primary school. It feels hard to stay with this topic though‚Ä¶ part of me just wants to shut it down and say, ah never mind, we've talked about it enough. It was all a long time ago.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo part of you wants to shut it down‚Ä¶ that sounds like there's another part that wants to talk about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, part of me does want to talk about it. Like from a  year old perspective, there's bits of it that are hugely important. But from an adult perspective, those same things don't seem to really matter. I kind of go back and forth between those two perspectives.‚Äù

She asked me if I owned one and I said no, but if it was ok for her to own one then it should be ok for me to have one too. I said I'd thought I'd seen her wearing it a couple of weeks ago and that's why I'd asked. We had a discussion about what she used it for. She explained her motivations for wearing one. I told her it felt like she was just trying to cover up what she really used it for. She told me I was assuming that her thoughts worked the same way as my thoughts. I know she does always try and be her genuine authentic self with me so part of me wants to completely believe her, but another part of me thinks she was thinking Oh shit! Rumbled! Better put a good spin on this.  I have therapy tomorrow and I'm trying to get my brain back into therapy mode after a week off (so two weeks since my last session). I only wrote about the first half of my last session. This Fitbit discussion took a good  minutes. The second half of the session we spoke about my mum some more. T pointed out the discrepancy between wanting to believe my mum was perfect yet also choosing to do things differently with my own children. It's a very good point that I can't argue with. I am trying to use it as a basis for restructuring my view of things.

Doc ID: 14956, distribution: 0.04347089351997567 ; We were a bit naughty yesterday and we went to visit d at her university. She was so desperate for us to go and see her and take her out for lunch. We drove there, picked her up, went to a lovely pub for Sunday dinner, then went for a walk in a local park, stopped in a coffee shop and then took her back to her accommodation and came home. It was a bit of a long day out but it was so good to see her and she kept saying how nice it was to do a normal and non-studenty thing, and just walk around a different area and see families doing normal family things. She seems to be much more settled at uni now, starting to find her feet and enjoy her independent living. I'm writing about it here because I can't post it on any other social media, since we were breaking the rules. We left our tier and went to a different level tier which we're not supposed to do. And then we went out for a meal (and later a coffee) and said we were all one household, which strictly speaking we currently are not, because d is in a household with her student flat. To order in the pub, I had to create an account on their app, which I had to invent a local postcode for. I couldn't use d's postcode because it's for a student flat so evidently not a family home. So much deceit. I feel very guilty. This aspect of the rules is very difficult for me, the way it divides students from their families. I just cannot get my head round my child who is only just over  no longer being in our household. Especially when come Christmas she will be back home with us again (so help me, UK government if you change that rule) so is it really that different.  Anyway this is my confession. I think our visit was very important to d and her mental well-being so I don't regret it. Now England is about to go back in to full on lockdown, d may come home again in the next few days and we will be back to being one household again. Or she may decide to stay at university. I don't know yet, I think she will be swayed by what her friends there decide to do. I think it will be possible to get her home in the middle of the lockdown period if she changes her mind so I don't think it's a now-or-never kind of decision.  Oh while I'm confessing, I also let d out of her  day self-isolation period  hours early because she was becoming one with her bed and that wasn't doing her any good either. She had no symptoms so it seemed unlikely she was about to suddenly develop any. Anyway there we are I have off-loaded my conscience. The baby and I are off for one last Covid-secure swim now before the gym shuts again for lockdown. It will probably be our last ever swim together. Bittersweet times.

I think my T has only had two weeks at a time off, although she has an annoying habit of taking it right before a school holiday so she's away for two weeks and then I'm away for two weeks. What has helped is her letting me email her on my usual therapy day each week, not even therapy stuff, just a little update. Then she'll send me a reply though only a short one. Have you talked with your T about how you feel about the break? Sometimes just talking about it helps. I usually tell T I need her to cancel her holidays and she shouldn't go away and leave me. Sometimes therapists can give you a transitional object or a note to help you remember they're still there and that they'll be coming back. Sometimes I ask T to promise she won't forget me. And she reminds me that she will think of me from time to time. I've tried to get her to say she'll miss me, but she won't go that far ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSome therapists can give you a back up therapist in case you need someone to talk to over the break, so if you think you might need or want that option you could ask. I often try and schedule myself something nice to do in my usual session time, or do something I know would make T proud of me. Bottom line it's very normal and expected to miss your therapist over a break and it's ok to have all the feelings about it, and your therapist will likely be expecting it. So don't be afraid to bring the subject up in therapy and talk about it.

Doc ID: 15566, distribution: 1.0 ; Moving forwards in therapy  Therapy yesterday was really good. I've had a run of good sessions recently, no ruptures for ages. I wonder if it's because I've built so much trust in T now that I can tell her in session, when it happens, if something isn't right or isn't helpful, and we can alter course immediately to get back on track.  I'm able to talk more fluently in session and although we still have pauses, they're mostly not caused by my brain shutting down, they're more constructive thinking pauses. It's taken years of work to get to this point (I'm sure other therapy clients get there faster‚Ä¶ I feel like I've been very slow, although I can also have compassion for myself and understand why that is, so I'm not blaming myself. It is what it is). I think we're doing good work together at the moment. I feel like I'm moving through stuff. Some years ago, T likened our position in therapy at that time to being on a rollercoaster, but just sitting at the top of the track, moving back and forth‚Ä¶. not rolling backwards but not moving forwards either. At the time, she said it's like we're sitting up there, just waiting‚Ä¶ waiting‚Ä¶. to set off forwards again.  I think I felt a bit unhappy with her analogy when she said it because it felt like she was saying we were stuck, and I didn't feel like I was stuck. There was lots going on in my head, rearranging of thoughts, processing stuff, but it was probably stuff she didn't see because I was still struggling to share everything I was thinking. Eventually I can't remember exactly what happened, but there was a session where all my internal building of momentum finally reached a tipping point and we started to move forward again. I think soon after that, T said we were ‚Äúhurtling along‚Äù.  I imagine that's quite normal in therapy, periods of not much progress seeming to happen, and then periods of really fast growth. It's not always an exact steady process. I feel like I'm in a time of fast growth again at the moment. Lots of little insights. Learning things in particular situations that I think I will be able to apply to broader situations in the future. Accepting my attachment to T and my feelings towards her as being ok and healthy and necessary to enable me to do the work I need to do. Learning to ask for and accept things from her.  It all feels good. We haven't spoken again about her retiring, so I think that means the date is still over a year away. I'm glad about that.

Answer: One time when there were lots of stressful goings on in my house and I texted her about how difficult everything was, I then texted and said can I come and stay in your house? I've forgotten what T said in reply but then I said ok I'm going to come right now, I'm going to get the train. And T said that's fine but I'd have to get a couple of local trains that only run a few times a day to get cross country to hers, so then I said ok, maybe I'll wait till tomorrow then. The conversation was a sort of jokey one that I'm sure we both knew it had meaning underneath. And one time when I went to visit her in person after she'd moved, we had a conversation about what would happen if I couldn't leave when my session time was up. Which is kind of not quite the same thing but similar, and we came up with a strategy for how we would make it easier for me to leave.There may well have been other conversations over the years but I can't remember them.

I tried to wrestle myself back up to the surface, but in the end I just said to T, ‚ÄúI don't like it when you do that!‚Äù She took that on board and asked me how I would rather end things. ‚ÄúWould you rather just keep on talking about deep things right until the last moment?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNoooo‚Ä¶. it just feels like too much of a jump though. Too sudden.‚Äù I need her to wrap up what we're talking about a bit more, even if it's just saying that we'll carry on talking about it next week but we need to start bringing things to a close now. I know I am bad at ending on time. I never take responsibility for it. If T doesn't end the session, I just keep talking. I don't like the ending, having to leave and not see her for another week. She does have to gently push me out a little bit at the end. She usually does it by talking about scheduling for my next session, and at that point I will take it as my cue to end. But until she moves into that, I figure she's still willing to sit there and be with me so I just keep going.

I said how careful we'd been before Christmas and isolated and got up to see my parents, and she said ‚ÄúBut did you isolate when you came back?‚Äù and I said No, and T pulled a disapproving face. Ugh that's still bugging me. I mean, it wasn't like we really went anywhere but the girls met a friend each for a walk outside, which didn't feel too unreasonable to me given that I'd made them stay home for so long. Anyway, that kind of ended that conversation, so we sat for a moment and then T said ‚ÄúSo, where shall we start today?‚Äù I had written a list of things to mention and I just went with the first thing on it, which was that as we'd discussed that I would, I weighed myself while at my parents' house. We don't have scales in our house so I always get a bit obsessed with their scales when I'm there. It is always difficult to say my weight out loud to my therapist (or anyone), but I managed to tell her what it was. It was at the very bottom of the healthy range I maintained through .  I said that it was ironic that in , I weighed myself once a week and that made me focus a lot on what I was eating and exercising, and yet in  I didn't weigh myself at all between February and December, and I ended up weighing less than I did when I was focusing on it. Weird. T asked me how I was feeling in myself, did I have energy, am I warm enough etc and I said yes, generally I was feeling good. There have been a few occasions when I got light headed when I stood up too fast, and that annoys me because I am eating so I don't know why my body is complaining.  T said she thinks we need to stop focusing too much on numbers and weight and bmi and think more about how I am feeling about my body so I can learn to trust that. We discussed how my weight was what I would have predicted if I'd taken a guess based on how my body feels to me. T said ‚ÄúThat shows you that you can trust your perception of your body.‚Äù My head still craves numbers for security, partly because of past incidents in my teenage years, but I am definitely going to work on trying to trust my perception more.

It gives me all these opportunities to prepare her emotionally for the upheaval in ways that my parents never did for me. This evening she has been calculating her budget and talking about getting a job to and also doing some volunteering. I said they were great ideas and definitely if she has the capacity and wants to, she could go for it. But I said don't underestimate the enotional and physical energy required to settle in when you move to a new city and start a new course and meet new people and have to look after yourself for the first time. I said she might find that at first just doing that is quite enough and in that case not to put pressure on herself to do anything extra for a while. The other night I got a chance to talk to her about how she will have some days where she just feels really wobbly and like it's all too much and she doesn't want to do it. And when those days come, just know that it's really normal to feel that way and it will pass, like maybe you just have to see that day out and then go to bed and when you wake up the next morning you'll feel more positive. I think she's going to do just fine at university and will probably thrive on the independence once she gets settled in, but it can never harm to give her some tools so she knows that if she has bad days, she can get through them.

T knows I get super stressed and a bit irrational when hospitals are involved.  ‚ÄúIt's really difficult being the parent of a teenager in hospital. d doesn't want to talk to the doctors, so I talk to them on her behalf and say what's going on. But then I get all worried that they'll think I'm not letting her speak for herself. And that then they'll start thinking 'controlling parent' Then also the morphine issue, every time any of them asked me about her pain relief, I thought omg they're thinking I'm just trying to dose her up on morphine in a kind of Munchausens By Proxy kind of way. T said she didn't know much about MBP but she thought maybe if I had enough insight into worrying I had it then I probably didn't. ‚ÄúShall we look it up on the internet now so you can reassure yourself?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNo, no I don't think I've got it! I'm just worried that other medical professionals will think I do.‚Äù Honestly I can see this all probably sounds completely daft now, but I spin off down these rabbit holes of irrational thoughts at times, especially medical related ones, and I cannot see my way out of them. I just wish I was a person who was so sure of myself that I could deflect these rather than absorbing them and panicking. I have a friend who quite often when she's telling me a story about some situation she's been in where someone has been a bit off with her, will say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI'm not taking that from them! They can f*ck right off!‚Äù I asked T how do I get that self assurance, where I'm so solid in who I am that I don't get caught up thinking about what other people think about me.  T asked me if it was getting less difficult over the years of therapy, and I said no it wasn't!! I still get twisted up in these trains of thoughts just as much as always. She tried to convince me it was getting better but I don't think it is. We were nearly out of time so T quickly asked me how eating had been while we were in the hospital, and I answered honestly that it hadn't been great because I just couldn't deal with making decisions about food in the hospital along with everything else I was trying to manage, so I ignored my hunger a lot of the time. She asked me if it was getting back on track now, and I said yes, I was having it be a bit more intentional about eating for now but I was doing ok. T reflected that I was much better at getting back on track now than I used to be. Now I might have a little dip, but I get back out of it pretty quickly. It really is just a blip. Whereas in the past, a little dip would quickly become like a runaway train and it would take me ages and a lot of intervention from T to get back on track. It was a positive reflection to end the session on.

It was also hard to talk about with her because I worried that it crossed the boundary between her as a therapist and her as a mother, especially if I texted her about it out of session when she wasn't necessarily in therapist mode. We did talk about it and I told her how competitive eating disorders are and how unhelpful it was to know what she'd told me. I also asked her if her daughter was well now and she said yes she was.The session after that, T said she had taken it to supervision and her supervisor had thrown her hands up in horror and said ‚Äúwhat did you do that for?‚Äù in reference to her telling me. So I felt quite validated by that.I really don't know any details of her daughter's eating disorder or even what type it was. Someone on tumblr pointed out to me at the time that I am probably getting a much better deal from her being my therapist, than her ed-daughter is getting from her as a mother. Because therapy is so one-way and boundaried whereas family relationships with eating disorders involved are so much more complicated. That was very helpful and I felt much better after thinking about that.

Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.2582423307789262 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less ‚Äútraumatised‚Äù viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said ‚ÄúI'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today‚Äù which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said ‚ÄúCan I just talk about something else?‚Äù. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked ‚Äúwhat's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it‚Äù I replied.  T looked at me.‚ÄùYeah‚Ä¶. that's magical thinking. How would they know?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.‚Äù T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before.

I started to think that maybe she would regret using those words because she just said them in passing and now here am I fixating on them. She's probably going to wish she'd never said it. So I asked her in session yesterday if she still thought that some of what went on was emotional abuse. (Don't be fooled, it took me several minutes to get that question out) In true therapist style, she wouldn't just say yes or no. She made me work for the answer.  She asked me what my gut feeling was, and I said it was that she had just said it to make me feel better in the moment but now she regretted it. We had a discussion about that. She said she didn't say things just to make me feel better. I said again ‚ÄúSo are you saying yes or no to my question?‚Äù Slippery therapist, next she asked me how I would feel if she said yes she still thought it, or no she got it wrong. I said if you still thought it, I would feel‚Ä¶. relief‚Ä¶ and I would feel‚Ä¶ validated.  If you thought you'd got it wrong, I would feel like, ehh I knew it wasn't that bad, I was just being over dramatic. I probably made it sound worse than it was. T quoted back to me some things I'd written in my story and she pointed out how Not Normal these things were, and how contradictory it was for me to say it wasn't 'that bad'. I was trying really really hard with the eye contact at this point. T looked at me and said ‚ÄúThat little girl being put through that and nobody stopping it! Yes comfort afterwards, but nobody putting a halt to it while it was happening. That was a misuse of power - that's what abuse is - over many years. It was emotional abuse.‚Äù  Finally she answered my question.

Doc ID: 16825, distribution: 0.1904948874548623 ; Mum waffle   I was away last weekend with my mum and my sister. I also saw my mum the weekend previous to that. I find it very difficult to talk about her in therapy and be able to reflect on our relationship past and present at a period of time like this when I see her so much. However I won't see her for a while now so I can try and be more objective again. For anyone reading this, remember I have all the good things about my relationship with my mum safe in an imaginary box.  While we were away this weekend, two things struck me. First, I noticed how judgemental my mum can be. Talking about an old friend she stayed with recently, she makes statements like ‚ÄúOh she just needs to‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe should do‚Ä¶.‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf only she would‚Ä¶‚Äù, all of which imply that my mum knows the one and only way to navigate life and if everyone was just the same as her, they would be much happier. Something about this is tugging at me. I think she said similar things all through my childhood, only I didn't recognise it as being judgemental or overcritical, because I just thought my mum knew best. I didn't realise her words were opinion, because I accepted them as facts. I think the eating disorder voice in my head says similar things, states opinions as facts. ‚ÄúYou'll be much happier if‚Ä¶‚Äù The second thing that happened was as we were coming home, our flight got in much earlier than expected so my mum and sister said they would catch an earlier train. I said I couldn't because my ticket was only booked for one specific train. It turned out my mum and sister had the same type of ticket, but they were planning to hop on board their (separate) trains and just blag. I said I wasn't doing that because it would make me too stressed and anxious. My mum thought I was being ridiculous and spent ages trying to tell me what I needed to do and to convince me that there would be no problem, and even if there was I would just have to get off at the next station.  I pulled a face, and in the end she threw her hands up and said ‚Äúoh well, you just wait and get the next train then‚Äù in a weary frustrated kind of way. My sister said to her ‚ÄúYou're not supposed to speak to anxious people like that! You're supposed to say 'I can see you're finding this situation very difficult.'‚Äù My mum rolled her eyes and repeated the phrase to me in a sarcastic tone of voice. The frustrating thing is, I know my mum knows how to respond to people with anxiety because she has worked with them in the past. However when it comes to me, she thinks I'm just being pathetic, and if I would just pull myself together and be sensible, I would be fine. I have been anxious all my life but I have learnt to shove it down and just get on with it because my mum has always had this sort of approach. No space or validation for my own feelings, so I never learnt how to deal with the difficult ones. This is what I'm going to talk about in therapy tomorrow.

She asked which bit of it I wanted to talk about. I said I wasn't sure if I really felt like talking about any of it right now. T suggested we try and push through that feeling, unless I wanted to talk about a different topic.  ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ we were looking at this list last session before the break‚Ä¶ and I'd forgotten - completely forgotten till we came to talk of scheduling right at the end - that I wouldn't see you the next week‚Ä¶ and then I was all in the middle of stuff on the list but suddenly I wasn't going to see you‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, it all felt a bit raw?‚Äù T asked ‚ÄúYes, it was all left hanging. And I'd forgotten I wasn't going to see you last week, because I'd been too distracted about you being unexpectedly away during the week before and whether you were going to be back in time for my session. It was like I'd been looking back and I forgot to look forward‚Ä¶‚Äù I don't really know whether T got what it felt like for me when she unexpectedly went away. Or maybe she did get it, but she had forgotten about the little exchange we had about it. Which is maybe understandable because maybe it was a family emergency and she has been caught up in dealing with it and has understandably forgotten some of the details of what went on with my therapy before hand. I still felt like she wasn't entirely on the ball this session.  We looked again at the list and I started talking about how ideally I would like to be able to share emotional stuff with H in the moment, without feeling lazy, guilty or demanding. As it is, I either only tell him when the crisis is all resolved and everything is neatly wrapped up, or when I have a massive meltdown to the point of not being able to function.  ‚ÄúWhen I'm all emotionally stressed out, in order to be able to share it with H, I need even more emotional energy. But if I'm all maxed out, I don't have any more emotional energy to use. So I just keep it to myself.‚Äù We talked about it for a bit but I can't remember now what we said. I think we might have run out of time at that point. T lightened up the conversation for a bit of grounding before we finished. I got talking about a fostering course I am doing and we ended up going about  minutes over time, but only on chitchat not therapy (maybe that's not so bad?)

The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says ‚ÄúWhere to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about‚Ä¶. what we were talking about last week?‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like I'm in a gap between those two things‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, well‚Ä¶. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?‚Äù I nod. T flips a page in front of her. ‚ÄúYou said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?‚Äù That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says ‚ÄúSo you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?‚Äù ‚ÄúNoooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm and did you feel that I felt like that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.‚Äù We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? ‚ÄúNo, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think‚Ä¶ I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit‚Ä¶ *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.‚Äù I hadn't ‚Äústopped eating‚Äù, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached.

Doc ID: 15963, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // the relationship > everything else  This is just a quick round up of this session because not a lot happened and I didn't write any notes afterwards. I had things I intended to talk about but I just couldn't get my brain to sink into that therapy space. My brain was like ‚Äúnope I'm going to stay adult this session‚Äù. So we started the session talking about the coronavirus. Bear in mind this session was a week and a half ago, before any strong measures had come into force in the UK. We were just on a recommendation to avoid public places if possible. However I'd been rather obsessively following the bbc live news feed about what was going on in Italy and what was likely to be coming our way, so I felt sure that things were going to get more serious. T asked me how things were, and I talked about my coronavirus worries for maybe  minutes. Then T tried to open up the therapy space. She asked if I had a list of things to talk about. I had thought I would talk about how difficult it felt to disagree with her slightly. Last session, we had talked about how I felt H deserved a nicer wife than me. T said that was about identity, and we had talked a little bit about that although I didn't fully embrace her idea. I am not so sure it's about identity. If I was all on my own, I think I feel quite confident in who I am (there's a lot of ‚ÄúI am‚Äù statements from the Bible we talked about and I actually feel pretty good about most of them).  My issue is more with, for example, I know H would like me to be all touchy-feely and I'm just not, I feel smothered when he tries to do that draping himself all over me thing. (His brother and his wife do this a lot and when I see them, I just feel guilty about how much H would like it if I was like that) So I feel like H deserves someone who wants to be all touchy feely with him and I feel bad that I can't be that person.  I don't know if that all ties back to identity or not. And that's my problem. I grew up learning that I should never disagree with something my dad said, unless I had a full on defence of my statement lined up in my head. That makes it feel hard to disagree with T sometimes, I feel like how can I say ‚ÄúI'm not sure it's to do with identity‚Äù unless I've got a solid defence and counter argument ready. Anyway, I was trying to explain this to T, but she wasn't really getting it and I wasn't really explaining it very well because I kept lapsing into silence. T was asking questions to try and understand, and eventually I pulled a face at her and did a massive sigh. She started to ask me another clarifying question and then broke off and said ‚ÄúAh no‚Ä¶ back off‚Ä¶. that was a big sigh. What did that mean?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúMy head is just not in the game today‚Äù. And then we basically went back to talking about coronavirus for the rest of the session, at which point I got very animated and talkative again after being quite shut down. So that was it, not a whole load of therapy went on. But what can you do? These are difficult times and I was really preoccupied with the goings on - which subsequently turned out to be extremely valid because look what has gone down since then. T hadn't been following the news with quite the same intensity as me and so we weren't quite on the same page, but she did manage to track me ok in the end and stay connected.  It didn't feel like a very productive session, but honestly, we've been doing weekly therapy for  years so I guess a session here or there where we don't do any deep work has to be expected. I'm thankful that we didn't have a rupture and that T managed to reconnect with me before the end. In the end it's about the relationship above anything else.

She said over the years some of the things I have disclosed about my childhood have made her really angry, but she hasn't said it at the time as she needed me to come to my own conclusions. Which she thinks I have now.  ‚ÄúI want to say to them, how dare you make mealtimes like that?! All about recriminations and sadness! Mealtimes are meant to be happy times, everyone coming together, and instead you make Faith cry! Your dad being angry like that‚Ä¶. your parents not dealing with their own emotions.‚Äù She said lots more on the subject but I can't remember all of it word for word. She was showing me she was on my side and I did feel it when she said all that. In my mind, I could feel her stepping up next to my child-self and defending me.  I know that it's important for her stay neutral and not put ideas in my head or whatever, but I'm not brave enough to validate my own childhood feelings because I have this loud critical voice that tells me I'm just making a fuss and to shut up and get on with things. So I really really do need to hear it from T. At the end of the session, T asked me how it felt now we had talked about that. And I said that it felt better, that I felt a bit more like she was on my side, because when it feels like she's defending my parents or justifying their actions about me moving up, then I feel like I'm alone and I'm making a fuss about nothing. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ you're definitely not doing that‚Äù T said. I nodded while looking down, and she repeated again in a softer voice, ‚ÄúYou're definitely not doing that‚Äù. I felt very soothed by the way she said that and in my imagination I felt like T had put an arm round me and reassured me, like an adult might to a child. The session seemed to come into land quite gently this week. We didn't do any grounding or small talk at the end, just scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

I understand that - but you're not there now‚Ä¶. you can say anything here‚Ä¶ so go ahead and say it!‚Äù I started talking about my mum's values and how she overvalued academic achievement, so I imagine that she didn't really think too much about the emotional impact on me now or in the future. My mum had her own values, she wanted to bring us up very innocent I think. She had no interest in keeping up with the latest trends. ‚ÄúThat was ok for her, at home, but we had to go out into school and mix with the other children, and it was hard, to feel different.‚Äù T looked like she was still trying to understand what I was saying so I tried to explain further.  ‚ÄúMmm, so this will sound like the most stupid shallow thing, but it's just the first example that comes to mind‚Ä¶ so my parents never watched soap operas‚Ä¶ Coronation Street or Emmerdale or Eastenders, all that kind of thing, and all my friends parents did, and my friends would always be talking at school about the plot lines and the characters, and I just had no idea who they were talking about. My mum thought soap operas were a waste of time, and she thought the storylines weren't appropriate, so she wouldn't have them on the TV.‚Äù  T got that and she added, ‚Äúoh yes, and your mum wouldn't let you watch certain children's programmes either, would she?‚Äù, which was something we'd talked about the week before. I said no, she wanted to keep us quite innocent and in her world and that's all very well but we had to go out into the outside world, and I don't think it ever occurred to her that made it hard for us socially. It's been something I've always been very mindful of with my own children, I've never wanted them to feel left out or different in that way. I said the equivalent now would be like banning your kids from having tiktok, snapchat, Instagram etc. That's great when you're all at home and your kids can have other activities, but then they have to go to school each day and all their friends are talking about these apps and who said or did what in them, and your kids just can't join in and then they're left out - or worse, they're the weird kids who don't have these things‚Ä¶  We ran out of time at this point. We were already  minutes over because the internet had played up and T had had to move rooms to get a better connection. I was very spacey having spent so much of the session back in childhood. I could have done with T helping me with a bit of grounding, I'm sure she could see I was struggling to get fully back to the present. She was scheduling for next week and I was half there and half not, she repeated herself and then told me about a week in October when she won't be here. ‚ÄúBut I am here next Tuesday, so I'll see you then.‚Äù We said goodbye and I managed to get myself present enough to be able to click off the call.

The light was shining in through T's window and making it hard for me to see her so she closed a blind and checked back if I could see her better. Sometimes she's in her therapy office when we Skype and sometimes she's in another room in her house, so one of the first things I do when we connect is check out what's in the background and figure out where she is.  We talked about the task T set me last week, which was to think about what I would like to be different in my relationship with H. We've been talking about my avoidant attachment style and I asked T how I can change it. Yes I've learnt a secure attachment in therapy with my therapist, but I want to know how I can take that outside the therapy into my relationship with my husband.  I do want a secure attachment with H, but at the same time I think about the hard work it could take to get there and the uncomfortable feelings, and I am unsure if I want to push through that enough. I said to T, ‚ÄúSometimes I want it, and sometimes I just want to want it‚Äù T accepted that, she reflected it back to me and we talked about it a bit. Then she came back to my list and asked me what was on it. I said the first thing was that I want to not feel like there's something wrong with me. Wrong because I hate some things so much that I think normal people would like. I talked about compliments and some sorts of affectionate touch. T got a bit sidelined into thinking it was about body image, which I don't  really think it is. I don't think I have particularly bad body image. Of course I have bits on my body that I think could be better, but on the whole, I'm happy with how it looks.  As the screenshot from last week said, being close to H feels stressful for me. It's the effect of my avoidant attachment style. Without batting an eyelid, T brought up the subject of sex. We talked about that a bit. It's somewhere we've never really gone before so it was quite weird. New ground. She was very matter of fact about it so I took my cue from her and used it to keep myself regulated while we were talking.

Mostly thoughts that ending therapy is a necessity at some point and that I want the ending to be well managed and enough time to do it properly, not have it forced upon us by external circumstances. I said that I hadn't intended to say it last week but I felt like after T had brought it up, I felt like I had to say it because if I waited till this week to say it, it would seem like I was just saying it sort of as a defence to what T had said. T said I was making good progress, some big leaps, in therapy and if I wasn't making any progress, she would be suggesting we finish. But I am making progress. I was thinking, are you talking me out of finishing? It felt a bit like that, even though she said ‚ÄúI'm not saying that I think we should finish this year or that we shouldn't finish next year‚Äù I do trust that she works very ethically and she has supervision, so I don't think she would talk me into staying as a client if she didn't think it was best for me. I asked ‚Äúbut how do you know when you're ready to end?‚Äù T said ‚ÄúHmm I think you just know‚Äù I said ‚ÄúYes but when we have a foster baby, imagine if there was a family all ready to adopt them and social care said to us, when will you be ready to say goodbye, what date would you like the move to be? I would say never. I'd never be ready. It feels like that with therapy.‚Äú I said ‚ÄúOn the other hand, I'm never going to know if I can cope with stuff, the stuff that will inevitably happen, without therapy, until I actually try it.‚Äù T agreed with me and talked again about how when we felt like the time was right, we could cut down therapy sessions, first to every fortnight for a while, and then to once a month. So we would have time to see how I coped without therapy in those in between times and get used to managing things myself. T said ‚ÄúMaybe you need to hear that this is about a relationship, for both of us. That we will both grieve it when it's ended. To do long term therapy, it has to become a relationship. We have a meaningful relationship and there will be a time of grieving when it's over.‚Äù We had lots of eye contact and I felt our good connection while she was saying this. After she'd said it, we sat quietly for a few moments. ‚ÄúHow does it feel in your body right now?‚Äù T asked. Ugh I can't answer that. I scanned my body but there was nothing in particular there. I felt sad but it all seemed to be in my head. T said she felt a tightness in her chest and throat, like you might feel when you were sad. Even with her prompting I couldn't answer her question though. Eventually I told her ‚ÄúThat's a too-hard question‚Äù. We sat quietly again.

Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. ‚ÄúUh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.‚Äù (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said ‚Äú‚Äù. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, ‚ÄúOh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown‚Ä¶.. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.‚Äù T sucked a breath in and said ‚ÄúOhhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.‚Äù I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.6408993599747529 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 15234, distribution: 0.46573700929883216 ; Therapy .. // endings  T brought the conversation back round to endings, as she had made a note in her diary previously for us to talk about it this week. We aren't talking about the practical details of imminent termination but I think T is working on a drip drip approach with the topic. She said she is going to bring it up once a month. I am finding that I am gradually managing to stay more present in conversations about ending therapy. Previously I would shut down completely at the mention of it, then there was a session just into the start of lockdown when T said she was now planning to retire in the next couple of years, and I felt myself going to that shutdown place and I fought against it and managed to stay mostly present. Since then we've talked about it twice more I think. My window of tolerance for staying with the topic is enlarging gradually. T always reminds me that she is not leaving yet, and that we will have a steady phase out of sessions over many months, not just a sudden end date. (Of course this is dependent on nothing unexpected occurring in her life or mine that forces us to stop therapy early. I am a little bit scared of that happening. It's one of the few positives to ending therapy that I can see, being in control of the end rather than having it suddenly pushed on us.) She asked me how the two week break had gone. I looked down and fidgeted a bit and then said ‚ÄúIt was like part of me is like the baby when I go out of the room, she cries because she thinks I've gone forever. And then another part of me is like me in the other room, calling back through to the baby that I'm still here‚Ä¶ So there's part of me that's wailing and crying and feeling abandoned because you're not here, and then there's another part that's saying it's ok, T is coming back, she hasn't disappeared, she hasn't left you‚Ä¶‚Äù T waited a moment to check I'd finished speaking, and then she said ‚ÄúThat's really good, Faith! It shows you're learning to parent yourself now. That was something you couldn't do before.‚Äù I responded that it was one thing to do it now, when I knew she was coming back, but what will I do after we have ended therapy? There won't be that reassurance then. T said that maybe we can continue to do three monthly check-ins after we've officially ended. I don't know if she was saying that off the top of her head, I hope she has thought it through if so, because it feels a big thing to me. I would love to keep the connection and be able to check in every so often. I can see a parallel here with the way we say goodbye to our foster babies, and it makes me sad - but I'll keep that for another post.

Doc ID: 16035, distribution: 0.2748658659966367 ; Therapy .. // part  // emotional regulation   Moving on to thing # on my list, I wanted to talk about what happened last week with d and her ears. As usual, it takes me some time to summon up the courage to say what I want to talk about. T sits patiently and waits. She won't rescue me anymore, she knows I get there in the end. Even after I told her what I wanted to talk about, I struggled to find where to begin. I think of ways to start, and then another part of my brain shoots them down. On reflection, that likely stems from my childhood. My dad had no patience for a story that wasn't thought through, or that rambled and didn't make sense. And all possible weaknesses had to be defendable. It means I overthink and freeze often when I'm trying to tell something. T gave me a way in by helping me get started, and then I was able to tell her the whole saga. I was really only telling it in order to talk about my texting dilemma afterwards, but it was actually good to explain at all. T was really encouraging and said I had done a good job even though it had cost me a lot emotionally. She started doing her psychodynamic thing, looking for links back to my childhood, but I said actually I really wanted to talk about something else and that was just the background. She smiled and said ‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ and well done for interrupting me!‚Äù I told her about how I had a dilemma about texting her. I'm stuck between thinking that sooner or later I wouldn't be in therapy anymore and so she wouldn't be there for me to text her and so I should just learn to get on and cope with it on my own. And thinking that sooner or later she wouldn't be there and so I should make the most of it while she is there and (I got tied in knots here and ended up just reading out what I'd written which was ‚ÄúMake the most of it while she is there and it's ok to want to text her and I don't need to withhold it from myself‚Äù. I explained that withholding things from myself was an eating disorder behaviour, when the ed voice would tell me I could survive without x y or z and therefore I clearly didn't need to have it and must prove that I could manage without it. T said that she was absolutely happy for me to text her when I need to because she knows that I don't do it for just anything and only when I really need to. ‚ÄúI'm giving you something‚Ä¶. you're getting something from me. Some nourishment.‚Äù  Well that went a bit weird and therapisty üò≥. I looked at her. She carried on, ‚ÄúOne day you won't need to get it from me. You will be able to get it from people around you.‚Äù There was a long pause while I considered this. Eventually T said ‚ÄúYou look like you're wrestling with some sort of dilemma?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. I'm just thinking‚Ä¶. that I did message H and my friends too, so I was trying to reach out to my real life supports too. But its like‚Ä¶. if a child falls over in the playground then their friends all try and make them feel better, and that's nice‚Ä¶ but what they really want is an adult to come and look after them.‚Äù ‚ÄúYesss‚Ä¶. that's to do with emotional regulation. When your feelings overwhelm you, you need someone more emotionally regulated to take your overwhelming feelings and digest them and give them back to you in pieces you can handle. That's what you didn't really get as a child, that regulation of your feelings. So you haven't had that experience and that's why it's difficult for you to do it for yourself now. That's why you sometimes need me to do it for you. But you are learning to do it for yourself, it's just a slow process. It doesn't happen fast. But that's ok.‚Äù I do think in some areas I am getting better at it. Like in fostering, sometimes something happens that makes me really mad or upset, and I used to always go to my manager and wail about it and she would speak to whoever and resolve it. But now I'm starting to think hang on, I can do something about this myself without having to run and get an ‚Äúadult‚Äù to fix it for me. I'm learning to regulate myself more. Then T tried to do some grounding for the last few minutes and asked me a question about d, which I did answer but my brain was still on what we'd been talking about. So I said what I was thinking about‚Ä¶ and then we were out of time.

T asked me some questions about how my  year old self felt about moving up two years at school, but I didn't really feel safe to answer her. My  year old self does not feel T is fully on her side. T seems to often go back to defending my parents or justifying their decision, or sometimes even just being too rational about the whole situation and it just makes me want to cry pitifully and say ‚Äúwhy can't you just be on my side?‚Äù So I couldn't jump into further discussion with T without laying that out on the table. It took me some minutes to build up the courage to say anything‚Ä¶ my brain gets carried away working out what to say. Eventually I took the plunge and said ‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù Of course T said yes. So I said, ‚ÄúCan we‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶. just presume - when I'm talking about this stuff - that I don't need you to defend or justify my parents? That I've got all that stuff on full volume in my head anyway and I don't need you to say it.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúYes. So what have I said today that defends your parents?‚Äù That didn't feel defensive on her part, more curious as to how I experience what she says. ‚ÄúNo, not today, nothing today, but you did last week. And I just‚Ä¶ it took so long to get past me believing they were perfect and that it was me that was the problem‚Ä¶. and now I'm trying to see that not so good side as well but it seems like whenever I say anything negative about them, you're always defending them.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúOK, I think it would be helpful if you told me immediately, if you felt like I was defending them. Then we could speak about it.‚Äù I nodded. She continued ‚ÄúYou did think they were perfect for a long while - I still remember our very first session, when you told me 'oh no, there's nothing wrong with my childhood, there's nothing to talk about there' - and I heard that as a warning from you. A sort of 'don't even go there' message. So I needed to let you find your own way to your conclusions and not put my thoughts on to you. If I'd told you some of what I was feeling, it would have pushed you back into defending them again. But now I think you've got there, you are more realistic about them. You know they weren't perfect and I'm trying to help you get to a more balanced view, without tipping too far over into anger at them.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut maybe I just need to do that‚Ä¶. to go the other way for a bit‚Ä¶ before coming back to a balanced view‚Äù ‚ÄúYes‚Äù T said thoughtfully, ‚ÄúI was just thinking that. Maybe you do need to be angry at them for a while.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt really feels like, whenever I say anything negative, then you try and be rational about it and then you leave me on my own with how I'm feeling. And I just want you to be on my side!‚Äù

Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong ü§îü§Ø hence‚Ä¶. the therapist is always right??

We started by talking about this week's weight, which was the same as last week's. T asked me how I felt about it, and I said the ed was disappointed I hadn't lost weight but after I'd got over that, I was relieved because it meant we wouldn't have to spend the whole of this session arguing over food and eating. T smiled at that and I did too and it was a little moment of connection. We talked again about what had happened two sessions ago and T repeated her apology. I said it felt like she'd left me and I was on my own while she was headed off somewhere else and it was scary. She said that her part in what had happened was her responsibility and she hadn't been on good form that day. Then I tried to explain something more about it to her, and she got all muddled up and reflected it back to me all wrong. I put my hands up to my head in a moment of frustration and then rested my head on my hand and hid behind my hair while I took a few deep breaths.  I started talking again all in a rush and my frustration was evident, but gradually it calmed down as T realised what I'd been talking about to start with and I felt like she was understanding me better. I had a moment of feeling like we were getting our relationship back on track, but then she unfortunately chose to say ‚ÄúI feel like things have shifted since the start of the session. At the start of the session it felt like you didn't want to talk. But now I've talked about taking responsibility, it feels like things have shifted a bit? You feel a bit warmer to me?‚Äù Ugh it was too soon for that. Yes, I was starting to feel a bit warmer towards her, but she doesn't get to assume everything's getting back to normal yet. Immediately I felt irritated again and froze her out again. I didn't feel she'd worked hard enough to repair things and now it seemed she was trying to short cut it and be like ‚Äúoh maybe everything's ok now?‚Äù and it most definitely wasn't. In fact it went several steps backwards at the moment she said this. She definitely picked the wrong moment to make her comment.

Doc ID: 14593, distribution: 0.3649102331651276 ; Therapy .. // ending therapy thoughts  We had  minutes left after we'd spoken about the girls and their health kick and I asked T if we could talk about something else. I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  ‚ÄúOh yes, I remember‚Äù T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . ‚ÄúI genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?‚Äù That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the ‚Äútime to end therapy‚Äù is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said ‚Äúuh I don't have much time left‚Äù. T said ‚ÄúDoes it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?‚Äù and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside.

I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. ‚ÄúWhen you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.‚Äù T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. ‚ÄúYou look like you're about to say something‚Äù T commented. ‚ÄúI'm deliberating whether to say it or not‚Äù I said, pulling a face. ‚ÄúGo on then, let's just say it‚Äù  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said ‚Äúok, sooo‚Ä¶ it was a blip‚Äù. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it.

I had just spoken with T about wondering whether my parents worried about me going off to university at a young age. I felt that T's response to that was quite invalidating. I can't remember now exactly what she said but something about not assigning blame and that my parents loved me. It seems like we have done all this work in therapy getting to an acceptance that my parents weren't perfect, yet now every time I allow myself to express a little spark of anger or even dissatisfaction or sadness over them and their actions, T jumps in and tries to smooth it all over. That just throws me right back to my old thought patterns that clearly my parents were great and it's me that's somehow wrong, that the critical part of me that's rolling her eyes and saying 'ffs Faith you make such a big deal out of nothing' is right. ‚ÄúIt always feels like you're defending them‚Äù I said to T, in a resigned tone of voice. ‚ÄúOh no, no I'm not defending them. I'm definitely not defending some of their decisions. I'm definitely not defending them pushing you ahead two years at school.‚Äù I shrugged at her. Her intentions and words don't seem to match up. She said ‚ÄúMaybe we need to talk some more next session about my views of their actions and their relationship with you‚Äù I nodded, and said a bit defeatedly ‚ÄúIt feels like you're on their side‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm on your side, Faith. I'm definitely on your side.‚Äù We were nearly out of time and it felt like she was back-pedalling and trying to end on a reassuring note rather than a rupture. ‚ÄúI'm sorry if it feels like I'm not on your side. I really am. I think that's another thing that would be good to talk about next week‚Ä¶ how does that feel?‚Äù I heard her saying that she was on my side. I'm glad she said it so many times because it did help it sink in and gave me something to hold on to. I still feel a bit let down by her though in the way that I brought some feelings to therapy and she shut them down without exploring what was going on for me. She seems so worried that she will damage my relationship with my parents that she won't hold space for me to say negative things about them. That makes it really hard for me to try and recalibrate my views of them, from them being perfect to a more realistic view that they did their best but they didn't get everything right.  ‚ÄúI know this is a really horrible place to end‚Äù - T emphasised the 'horrible' - ‚Äúbut we really are out of time now.‚Äù We had already gone ten minutes over to make up for the poor internet connection, which she'd offered earlier in the session, so I know that by the time we finished she did probably have to dash off to her next client or whatever. I just nodded in acceptance and we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. I noticed immediately afterwards that I hadn't said ‚Äúthankyou‚Äù like I usually do at the end of a session. I guess I was still feeling her lack of attunement. There's a lot to process in next week's session.

T explained that she'd put a statement on her website about not taking new clients - she wondered if I'd seen it - and she just felt very aware that it was out there but it had gone unspoken between us, and so she wanted to bring it up so we could talk about it.  I had seen her statement, but I'd presumed she just wasn't taking any new clients during lockdown because it was difficult to start a new therapeutic relationship online. So I hadn't thought about it any further than that.  T then said lots of lovely things to me. I don't know if you'd call it damage limitation, but it was like she'd dropped this bombshell about retiring on me, and now she was quickly trying to catch me before I fell.  ‚ÄúI will never forget you Faith. You will always have a place in my heart. I really enjoy working with you. I do! I never think, oh no I have to see Faith today. You work so hard in therapy and you are always thinking‚Ä¶ working on things. I know it's a therapeutic relationship that we have, but you can't have a real therapeutic relationship without having some elements of a normal relationship too. That's the privilege of a therapeutic relationship. In fact, it can be deeper than a normal relationship because you have the boundaries in place to make it safe to go deeper than you usually would be able to.‚Äù I listened to her and tried to let myself absorb all her words. The battle between shutting down or staying present was still going to and fro inside me. Gradually as she kept talking, repeating the same things, her voice soothed me and I started to feel calmer internally. After T had stopped talking, there was a pause. ‚ÄúSo, what's going on in your head now?‚Äù I think I said something about how at least if T made the decision to end therapy, then I wouldn't feel regret for ending therapy myself. What if I decided to end, and then something happened and I needed T again. I'd be kicking myself. Whereas this way I would know I'd had no choice. T squinted at me and said she wasn't sure that was very therapeutic. To be honest, I think I felt a little bit gleeful. Maybe it's not therapeutic but it's what you've done T. I said I felt a little bit stubborn, ‚ÄúWell, now I don't have to make the decision myself about when to end‚Äù. T looked at me thoughtfully and said ‚Äúhmm I think that's important‚Ä¶ I'm not sure right now quite how, I'll have to have a think about it‚Ä¶‚Äù  We were coming to the end of the session and T said ‚ÄúI get the feeling that you were about an  or a  in terms of having a wobble when I told you, but how would you feel now?‚Äù I considered, ‚ÄúMaybe a  or ‚Äù ‚ÄúOk that's good, it's come down a bit then. Was I accurate in saying an  or a ?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ and I was having a wobble too in that I was nearly shutting down‚Ä¶. A few years ago I would have completely shut down for the rest of the session if you told me something like that. But I managed not to today.‚Äù T smiled and said I had done really well and it was good that I had noticed how much progress I had made.

The therapist seemed like someone d would be able relate to and hopefully open up to. The therapist started off talking a bit to both of us about how therapy with her worked, which was really just standard therapy stuff that I'm familiar with so I felt quite comfortable with all that. Then she asked us what was going on and d said that I should tell her, so I explained what had led up to me making the appointment.After about  minutes, I'd pretty much summed up the situation so then they kicked me out and I sat in the waiting room and drank my coffee while they talked. When they came down, the therapist said d had done well. d didn't have much to say but when we got out I asked her a bit about it, and she said she would like to see her again. D also saw how much the sessions cost, as it was on the therapy contract she was holding. That was something I'd deliberately not told her, so it came as a bit of a shock to her. Anyway, we are away the next two weekends but I have booked her another session for the weekend after that. I really hope she feels a little bit more contained having had one session and having another session booked in. We will see how it goes.

I commented on it and she said yes, some mornings she was all ready twenty minutes before our session and some mornings it was all a mad rush and this morning was a rush, but she was here now. She asked how it had been taking d to uni, and I started talking about my week - d's driving test, my birthday, taking d to uni, her flatmates etc. At the same time as I was talking, I wondered at the back of my mind why I was using my therapy time to talk about all this. I guess all that stuff was at the forefront of my mind, and it was good to say it and get it out of the way. Plus I like to update T on what's going on in my life. T made a comment about how they seem so young to be going off to uni. It felt a bit ironic given what we have been talking about. I don't know whether she'd thought about what she said or whether it was a spontaneous comment. She said again, ‚ÄúYes they seem so young when they go off to start their first year - and then they're like completely different people by the end of the year.‚Äù After about  minutes of chat, we came to a natural pause and it felt like I'd run out of ‚Äúpadding‚Äù. I don't know whether I was subconsciously avoiding jumping into the therapy work, but there was definitely a part of me that was comfortable with this more superficial chat. T sat back and said ‚ÄúSo, where to today? Have you thought any more about what we talked about last week?‚Äù I told her that my week had been such a whirlwind that I had barely thought at all and I couldn't even remember much from last week's session. T gave me a quick rundown of what we'd talked about (basically just all the going to uni two years early stuff). She said I'd given the account of how it all happened from a very rational place, and if the  year old child in me could speak about her feelings about it all, what would she say? or if that child part wanted to speak now, what would she say?

Doc ID: 17159, distribution: 0.18505969092910424 ; Therapy .. // separation   My head was not in therapy mode at the start of this session. I wasn't sure what to talk about. T brought up right away the end of the previous session where I'd said it felt like she was defending my mum, and that she'd apologised for that and knew that she didn't need to defend her.  I had to sit for a few moments and push myself to move into therapy mode, choose to dive back into it all. I took some breaths. Eventually I said ‚Äúit just seems‚Ä¶. not fair‚Äù T asked me what didn't seem fair. She made a suggestion which I can't remember now, but she was off on the wrong lines. However even when she gets it wrong, in telling her that's not what I was thinking it usually helps me get going and tell her what I am thinking. I talked about how my mum was throughout my childhood years, from about my age -. Her dieting beliefs (which I thought were ubiquitous in the nineties until T disillusioned me of that), and how much they impacted me. I thought lots of my mum's beliefs and actions around food were normal, because as a child we soak up what our parents tell us and we don't yet have any beliefs of our own to weigh it against. So for my mum it was ‚Äújust a dieting phase‚Äù yet for me it became my core beliefs around food. That's what's not fair. My mum got to move on from it and decide she didn't want to eat like that anymore, but I got stuck with it because I didn't know any other way to eat.  I talked about some of the other things my mum did that I struggle with now. I said I didn't think they were right and that she shouldn't have done them. T said I am becoming more separate from my mum now. ‚ÄúYou are able to think about things differently to her, and have different opinions about things. You can think that she might have been wrong about some things. That's a big change from when we started therapy, when you would defend her on everything.‚Äù T was really pleased about it and said it was good progress. I felt in that mind-boggling place where my perspective on my life shifts a little. The ground moves underneath me a bit. For a child, you grow up thinking your childhood is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. It's hard to detach from that and look back objectively and try and view it in a different way.  Suddenly we were nearly out of time. T reminded me that we had all the good things about my relationship with my mum safely put away so it wouldn't be contaminated by anything we talked about, and she said we had space for me to talk about being angry with my mum for as long as it took. ‚ÄúYou'll know when you've worked through it because it will feel different.‚Äù We scheduled for next week, which was the week I thought she was away. But it turns out it's the week after she's away. Yay so I get to see her on Tuesday after all which is only five days away.

Doc ID: 16894, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // part two  We sat in silence for a few moments while I projected a ‚Äúyou're not coming in‚Äù forcefield around me. T broke the silence saying ‚ÄúI definitely wasn't having a good day that day. Do you want me to tell you what I think was going on?‚Äù  No. I shake my head even before she's finished speaking. That's too scary. The scope of things that could be causing her to have a bad day is so huge and some of them would make things so difficult for me. I need to not know about her life. Now I feel bad for not letting her explain or seeming like I don't care. It's not that I don't care, it's just too hard for me to know because I care too much.  T said one thing had stood out to her from last session, and that was when I had a flash of anger when she tried to talk to me about eating and I said ‚Äúyou don't get to say that to me at the moment‚Äù. She said she could tell I was angry with her, and she asked how it felt to be angry. I said I didn't know but it felt uncomfortable to have her apologising to me. I don't like being apologised to. I'd rather shove it down and pretend everything is ok so that other people don't get the bad feelings. We talked about how much safer it felt to me to do that. She said she needed to apologise because what she said was her responsibility, and she got it very wrong. ‚ÄúI was being like your mum,‚Äù T said, meaning she had got caught up in judging or giving too much importance to the number on the scale. I said how snacking felt very shameful at the moment, because of how I'd mentally translated her words. She had said ‚Äúoh you're eating snacks are you?‚Äù and my head translated it in to ‚ÄúNo wonder you're gaining weight if you're eating snacks between meals‚Äù. I'm still struggling to shake off that shame. The ed is quite loud - my mindset has shifted in how I think about food, and it's not in a good way. Right at the end of the session, I asked her if she was muddling me up with her daughter, and saying things to me that she wanted to say to her daughter. I already wrote about that, but she said very clearly that we were very separate in her mind. I was glad to hear that. We didn't have any more negotiations about food or eating, and I am glad about that too. I'm not in a place to be receptive to T regarding that at the moment. Which is not to say I'm self-destructing or doing anything really unhelpful, I'm just not in the best place I could be or that I was a few weeks ago with food. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16181, distribution: 0.3534909653773143 ; Are you still there T?  If you remember, T asked if we could move this week's therapy session earlier in the day as she had to go away unexpectedly. I don't know where she was going or why, I never want to know that stuff. I figure it's probably not a fun reason she's having to go away though. I cannot bear it when my mum is upset or hurting‚Ä¶ it feels really overwhelming to me. Read into that something from my childhood dynamics and you'd probably be right. It's the same with T. I can't deal with knowing any difficult things going on in her life, I can't lean on her as a safe dependable strong figure if I'm feeling all this pain I imagine she's in. So I have to shut myself off from any of her potential pain by avoiding knowing any of her personal life. It's been hard thinking that's she's ‚Äúgone away‚Äù and is busy with her stuff. Little-Faith struggled with the idea that she ‚Äúwasn't allowed‚Äù to contact T because T had enough to deal with and we shouldn't bother her. Not that I needed to contact her, but of course when something is off limits, we often suddenly have an intense longing for it. Today I felt like I needed to know if T was still ‚Äúgone away‚Äù in the hazy unknown place, or if she was back nice and solid in her house. T has always been encouraging of me to text her when I need to feel our connection. She says it only takes a few seconds to reply to a text. I know early on in the relationship it was one of the ways we built up my trust in her, was to let me reach out to her when I needed to and see that she would be welcoming of it and not rejecting or punishing. I haven't needed to do it for ages but today I could feel little-Faith inside me feeling a bit abandoned, like T had dropped her and run off. So I decided it would be ok with ourself to message T and see if she was home. T replied and said she wasn't home yet but she was still 'here' even if she wasn't at home. I double checked and she replied again ‚Äúyep, really still here‚Äù. Little-Faith felt hugely comforted and reassured by this, like now she can relax and know that T is still holding us even if she is away somewhere. I sent T an ‚Äúok üòä thankyou‚Äù and she sent me back ‚Äúüëçüòä‚Äù. Emojis are so useful. On a side note, I think T must have cancelled her clients today if she's not home, unless she didn't have any scheduled in. I hope she's back by next week.

Doc ID: 14353, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // reading between the lines  When we had finally got the internet issues resolved and we had a stable zoom connection, I sat there looking at T and feeling completely derailed after all the upheaval. ‚ÄúI feel all over the place now‚Äù I wailed, waving my hands in the air. T said yes she did too and she asked me if I'd like her to pray. This isn't something she usually does but it felt right in this situation. She prayed and I felt calmed and soothed and like we were centred and back together in the 'room'. So then I tried to get started. I said to T ‚ÄúDo you remember last session that I ran out of time to say something at the end?‚Äù and when she nodded I carried on ‚ÄúThat was about something you said the session before‚Ä¶ when you said you would always be honest and real with me.‚Äù T said she remembered that. I said that I had felt quite emotional when she said it. We dug down a little to find out what kind of emotion it was, and eventually I said that it was relief. That if I knew she was going to be straight up with me, then I no longer had to worry about reading between the lines of what she might be saying but not saying. I spent all my childhood reading between the lines of what my parents were saying, and it's hard work to always be hypervigilant for what's actually happening - or what you imagine is actually happening. The two things play into each other, when you're hypervigilant and highly sensitive, you can create whole scenarios that may or may not be based in reality. I don't know how much of that is me reading things between the lines that weren't there and getting upset about imagined scenarios that weren't actually reality, and how much is me genuinely picking up on things that were going on below the surface. I suppose that's something I have to be ok with not knowing because there's no way of going back in time with adult eyes to find out. I said to T that I needed her to know that if she says that she will be honest and real and I don't need to read between the lines, then I won't. And so if she wants me to know something, she needs to tell it to me straight up and not expect me to figure it out from what she's said. I said ‚Äúso if we have a rupture and I get all stressed about something I've thought you've implied, then I'm going to try and soothe myself by reminding myself that you didn't actually say the words that my brain is creating from what you did say. So I need you to not get frustrated with me for not picking up on what you might have meant but not said.‚Äù It took ages for me to make clear to T what I was trying to say. I nearly gave up a few times and trailed off talking. She said ‚ÄúAm I not really getting you right now?‚Äù and I said ‚Äúno, not really‚Äù. T encouraged me to stick with it and keep trying to explain it, and she did eventually get it and summarise it beautifully in a couple of sentences. When she did that, I immediately relaxed and smiled and nodded that she'd got it bang on. T said that was fine and she would continue to try her best to be be honest and real with me and she wouldn't expect me to pick up things she hadn't actually said. She reminded me that I can always check things out in session, if she's said something and I wonder if she's implying something else. I will try and do that, although often I don't process what she's said till after the session. I too quickly get caught up in session with ‚Äúoh she must be meaning this‚Äù and then I tend to close it down with shame because my brain always translates it that she's trying to tell me I'm not good enough in some way. So that's something to watch out for in future sessions and also to try and spot when it happens to me in conversations with other people outside of therapy.

Doc ID: 15094, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // processing // part one  I told T it had been a difficult week, and then I wailed a bit about the Covid situation and my weekend anxiety spiral and how I'm still feeling fragile. I told her about doing the covid swabs and how the gagging part is kind of triggering but not in the sense that it makes me tempted to start purging, just that it brings back physical memories. T said she was glad that it wasn't making me have increased urges to purge. After I'd got all that out of the way, T said ‚ÄúSo with all that going on, have you had any time to think about what we talked about last week?‚Äù  I fidgeted a bit and stared away and said ‚ÄúMmm yes, I have thought about it. Uh, yeah‚Ä¶.. uh‚Ä¶ it felt good, when you said what you would have liked to have said to my parents. That felt like you were on my side, and it's easier for me to believe my feelings when it feels like you are on my side rather than when you're staying neutral.‚Äù  T nodded. I feel like I'm spoon feeding her this a bit - ‚ÄúI need you on my side for this‚Äù. I don't seem to able to validate my own childhood feelings myself. Probably because I'm still worried about my feelings being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, which I know comes from childhood where I learnt that mostly my own feelings *were* wrong and what was right was working out what other people's feelings were. Whatever those were, they were the ‚Äúright‚Äù feelings about the situation. ‚ÄúUm, and then when I was talking about that protocol that I found, for moving into different school years, and you said that it wouldn't have been around  years ago‚Ä¶ well then I felt like you were making excuses for them again‚Ä¶‚Äù T looked a bit thoughtful and said ‚ÄúMmm yes‚Ä¶ I can see that‚Ä¶ ‚Äú ‚ÄúI mean, maybe it wasn't around then, but presumably they wrote it at some point because there was a need for it. To stop children being moved around years in an unmanaged way‚Ä¶. At the end of it, it says that all these people should agree the move - the parents, the headteachers of the school, the educational psychology service‚Ä¶ it just seems‚Ä¶.‚Äù I drifted off into silence, staring into space. ‚ÄúIt just seems‚Ä¶‚Äù T prompted ‚ÄúUm, it just seems, that there were all these adults involved in making the decision‚Ä¶. like there was me, over here, a child‚Ä¶. and all these adults over there making a decision together and any one of them could have decided that it wasn't a good idea - but none of them did‚Ä¶‚Äù  (A note to my therapy notes, I'm not talking about this to cast blame or assign responsibility. It's really more about processing all the feelings around it, all the thoughts that come up. I'm not trying to reach any particular position at the end of it, I just want to explore my feelings and say some of the things that I've never had a chance to say.) I carried on to say to T that I could have said no, to moving up the second year. My parents did ask me how I felt about it so I did have a chance to say no, and if I'd said no, I'm pretty certain it wouldn't have happened. However I can't really blame myself on that front, it's not surprising that I didn't say no. I'd received messages all my childhood up till then that being bright and high achieving and doing everything younger than everyone else was a good thing and made adults pleased with me and made me special, so why wouldn't I have wanted to continue that?

It's from ‚ÄúThe Attachment Theory Workbook‚Äù by Annie Chen. I don't own the book, I was just browsing through it on amazon. When I read this paragraph, it really resonated with me. T read it and set off talking about it head-on at mph, and then seemed to realise what she was doing and pulled herself back a bit and gave me space instead to talk about how it resonated with me. I think this was a moment when her head wasn't fully in the game to start with. I talked about how H comes at me affectionately and it makes me pull away because I am not a touchy-feely person. But then the more I pull away, the more I feels he comes at me and his need for physical touch or closeness overwhelms me. T said maybe his love language is physical touch, and I said yes I think it is. I feel bad for not liking it, and then I feel bad for not being that person who does like it. I feel like H deserves someone nicer than me. H's brother and his wife are very touchy-feely with each other, and I think that's how H would like us to be and I just can't. T talked about how she would work if she was doing couples therapy with us. What she said wasn't really news. I know the theory of how couples therapy in that context works. T said she really only has a hazy view of H, and that's because of my avoidant nature impacting how I talk about him. T asked me if had spoken to H about any of this, and I said no not really. I said we used to talk a lot, before we got married, and we did talk about emotional stuff. But then we had babies and then my eating disorder got really bad and I was very shut down. And now I'm doing well in recovery from that but it's hard to find my way back to connecting with H again. I told her about how we went for a meal a couple of weekends ago and I did tell H quite a lot of the recent stuff we've talked about in therapy, and he surprised me by how well he dealt with it. T talked about how we have built up my trust in her and my relationship so that I can talk with her about all this stuff. I said yes but I don't have that trust with H, I don't trust that he will know how to respond. And then I can't think how I would carry the conversation, and then it all feels too hard.  ‚ÄúI'm going to set you some homework this week, Faith. I want you to find a time to talk with H about some of this, even if you just go for a walk around the block. Maybe you could tell him some of the process, even before you get onto the content. I mean like, tell him that you get uncomfortable talking about this, or that you worry he won't know what to say.‚Äù I looked very unconvinced at her. I told her how it all felt hard work, and I wasn't sure I wanted it. I think I said it was too much hard work several times through the session. I want it, but at the same time I know it's hard and uncomfortable to push myself to get to it, and so sometimes I feel like I will just stick with how things are. Towards the end of the session, T said ‚ÄúI've changed my mind on the homework. We'll leave talking to H for now. Instead I want you to think about how you would like it to be different between you and H.‚Äù I agreed to that (although I haven't really done it yet).

I'm holding on to the fact she is nearly six weeks and I hope she's read all the books that say it should get better after that. I know it will get better eventually. I've looked after lots of babies that were unhappy at this age, but there seemed always something to explain it - drug withdrawal, medical issues, prenatal trauma. Of course all babies in foster care have trauma from separation from their birth parents, so maybe some of it is just that coming out. Or maybe she's just an unsettled baby.

Came home and cried a little bit.  [insert various other baby things I can't write about] I texted T my weight and she replied that she was glad it was stable, with an emoji of a horse. A horse?? She put in brackets (stable?). I told her that was such terrible use of an emoji I think it was actually illegal. I'm sad I don't get to see her tomorrow because of [things]. We have had to reschedule for Thursday. But at least then it'll only be a few days till I see her again on Tuesday next week. I survived another drive with d this evening. She is doing ok but being so powerless in the passenger seat is still a terrifying experience for me. For some reason I decided to go sober for October. It's therefore the wrong month to be trying to teach my  year old to drive. I. Need. Wine. I also need to go to bed now but I'm playing permanent catch up watching The Circle. Any programme that's on more than once a week I can't keep up with. I don't even know how many episodes behind I am!  Right off to get bedtime snackage and set an early alarm for tomorrow üò¥

Doc ID: 14758, distribution: 0.31110490883704117 ; Question: I've always wondered about you referring to foster caring as a job. Where I live, people who have foster children also work outside the home at full time jobs. I know you care specifically for very young babies so is it because of that or is foster care just different where you live? Answer: In the UK, if you foster care for a baby you can't really work. If you worked then you'd have to put the baby in daycare and that sort of goes against what you're trying to achieve in terms of building a secure attachment. But also babies have lots of contact with birth families during the week and you need to be around to facilitate that, and also meetings, reviews, and appointments. So it's not really practical to have another job at the same time.It is possible to work in a job outside the home if you foster older children who are in school, but probably not working full time and you would need a flexible job so that you can be available during the day if needed for meetings etc. It's also about having enough mental physical and emotional energy for the therapeutic parenting that children in care often need. It might be hard to have the energy to give these children what they need if you're working, it's hard enough working and having your own birth children, never mind children who need even more from you (as they rightly should).

 learn how to cam / sugar. if its do or die you put that mask on and you make what you gotta work, work.  
 learn to flip drugs. extremely easy profits. only requires one good connection whos willing to front you. and of course multiple smaller connections on the buyers end. you went to public school, didnt you? theres your clientele. doesnt even matter if they liked or like you. theres always a demand.  
 exchange a talent for cash instead of just plain whining about your life for it. can you draw portraits of people? can you offer to write papers, or do homework, or take on chores in exchange for cash? can you do ANYTHING at all? if you have the resources and capability to get word out to ask strangers for $$ ur def capable of getting an advertisement out with the same damn plea on it for exposure.  
 collect &take back pop cans and bottles 
 coinstar if ur lazy or change rolls if u have time to go to a bank. which u should have. if ur unemployed u have time.

Doc ID: 15017, distribution: 0.30873142619376437 ; Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that's not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say  years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it's up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that's the foster care that we do. Then there's permanence foster care. This is when the child won't be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they're + and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there's adoption, where usually there isn't any contact with the birth family. There isn't much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic  weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the (+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it's done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were  years ago. However it's one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day . To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past.

The final straw was when I got a text from nhs track and trace telling me to download the new covid contact tracking app, and I felt so guilty and got convinced they sent it to me just because I'm somehow breaking the rules without realising. I ended up crying and writing a sad ole post on Facebook about how anxious I was and lots of people wrote nice things and said they were anxious too and they agreed that it was hard to know what the right thing to do was a lot of the time. That did make me feel a bit better. It was good to know I'm not the only one worrying about these things.  I dragged myself out of my pit of sadness and anxiety eventually but it only really lifted fully when I got my text this evening saying my test from this week was negative. However in amongst all of it, I did manage to a) not text T but search out my own support network instead and b) think ‚Äúwhat would T say?‚Äù and try and do a bit of mindfulness, because that would be something she might suggest.

Doc ID: 15917, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Although I understand it completely it's so heartbreaking to read that the baby only gets  minute visits with the parents each day. That must be difficult for you as well. Sending you and your family love Answer: Yes I imagine the hardest thing for them is just not being able to hold her. Newborn babies don't do a whole lot in terms of interacting, so she used to just sleep all the way through her face to face contact anyway. But she could have cuddles with parents and smell them and hear them. Now I have to try and predict a  minute window each day when she'll be awake, so they can see her and she can hear their voices.  minutes is quite long enough for baby, she usually ends up grizzling during it anyway. By the time she's fed and burped and had a nappy change, she's not too impressed with having to stay awake for a while longer. A small benefit though is that they get to see her five days a week whereas it used to be only three when it was face to face.

 having these babies for the last  years has taught me so much about myself, life, and others. taking care of two medically frail little honeybears, and having to take the time every day to handfeed luna for the last year or so has been extremely mentally challenging - especially so when my cat developed the brain tumor and i was tending to all of them at once. seeing the creatures i love like this has really made me appreciate health, and the little moments.

Going home in a fews weeks time and not being greeted by her tail wagging at the front door, or being able to take her out on morning walks each day is going to be so hard.

I thought I would spend the whole day after that in comfy clothes on the sofa, watching Greys anatomy and organising a photo book. But as I came home from my run, I discovered H hadn't taken his car to work, so I offered to take d out driving in her free period. We went to the gym car park and spent an hour reversing in and out of spaces. She definitely improved, which was encouraging for her and rewarding for me.

After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet.

 beckelstein: 

 I find it odd how the fandom focuses so much on Aang's childhood being ruined when he learned he was the Avatar at , but there's very little talk about how discovering she was the Avatar as a toddler affected Korra's life and¬†how she was raised. But we'll circle back to that‚Ä¶ Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters ‚Äì That is the Child Prodigy.¬† We'll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).¬† All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let's be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.¬† And that become a problem for one asshole in particular‚Ä¶  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai's maniacal ego couldn't handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn't the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this‚Ä¶  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering  of the  Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).¬† Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.¬† Aang/Sokka/Katara's story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.¬† Now, let's talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.¬†  Yes, of course I'm talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph's family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka's arm in environment where her bending couldn't help her ‚Äúsee‚Äù.¬† Toph's story is a foil to Azula's, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph's story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we'll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara's potential and Sokka's genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many  yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka's character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season.¬†Not to mention that because he wasn't a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can't be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations' actions.¬† Toph's anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn't as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.¬† While Toph's talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka's wasn't acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you're thinking. Zuko wasn't a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn't catch up with Azula's until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).¬† Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It's possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).¬† As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another's talent it's quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.¬† This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko's early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy's cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  ‚ÄúAzula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born‚Äù  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we've covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It's well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We'll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.¬† When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras' and other Avatars' lives.  . She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other  elements, buy also many things about the  other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naivet√© about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. .¬† She was trained and mastered  of the elements by the time she was . Most Avatars don't know they have this power until they reach  and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra's natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang's, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep. she lacked restraint. I'm not saying her bending isn't great, but rather because it is so great it's her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naivet√© of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.¬†  Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through  seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend  elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?¬† It's a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.¬†  Unlike Toph's parents, Iroh worried over Zuko's well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn't want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn't a prodigy like his sister.¬† And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.

Ive been sure to treat him as the most special little guy ever since we rescued him like a decade ago. Hes my dog and im his person. He knows i love him. And i know he loves me. And it will all be okay in the end and Im here for him when he passes The vets wont let people in so if i have him put down they take him in alone. Fuck that. Im so tired.

Answer: Well, we had had our three girls, they were ,  and , and I really wanted us to have another baby. H wasn't so sure and I spent a few months trying to persuade him. Eventually he came round to the idea, but then I had a panic and thought what if we have baby number  and it tips us over the edge, and it's me that's pushed us into that.So then at that same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster. I had taken some time out from my job as a doctor so that I could be at home with the girls, and when we started talking about fostering, I suddenly thought, we could do that! I could look after a baby and get that need met in me plus having a job while still being able to be at home with our children, and H could stop panicking about the cost of raising four children. We started looking into fostering, and doing all the assessments and before we knew it we were approved foster carers. It felt it was exactly the right thing for us to do then, and it still is now ü•∞

 i just texted him to not even bother today bc i want to spare myself the disappointment while im ahead. im turning my alarms off and im gonna lay down and shut my eyes and turn off my phone and try not to cry myself into asphyxiation like i always do. if i sleep now i can get like  hours before i have to get up and move about and tackle school.  
 ive barely been eating lately because im so overwhelmed and its so hard to prepare yourself nice food for not a lot of money when you live in the arctic tundra and ur stuck at a college all day with student facilities that are under construction and a broken ass car with no heat. i feel so stupid. i cant save money. i cant take care of myself. i cant maintain peace for more than  minutes. as soon as my animals die im not gonna have a fucking purpose anymore. im not even gonna be able to think straight or rest at all. i cant stop worrying and anticipating. times like this when u wish u had a mom or someone to tell u everythings gonna be ok. ive always sucked at comforting myself. my natural reflex to emotional pain is self destruction, not self soothing. i dont even know what to do. the oscillating catatonic panic attacks and the detached depersonalized episodes have been alternating so frequently that im even neglecting to go to the bathroom as often as i should. i almost pissed myself yesterday morning and i actually did piss myself today. i dont know why i try to fight my bodys cues. i dont know why i can take care of everyone and everything else but not myself.

Doc ID: 15081, distribution: 0.732109252721694 ; Today has been a Good Day. Such a relief after a couple of weeks of feeling mostly blah. I think it's because my cold seems to have gone and I've been busy today. My Get Up and Go seems to have come back! I had another foster carer come round for coffee first thing. She's a very new foster carer and I'm mentoring her, so we had a chat about all things fostering and that was lovely. It's great to share things you feel passionate about. Then baby and I hustled out to our baby sensory class, which the baby loves. When we got home, she went down for a nap and I went out for a run. H working from home has some benefits! I ran k along my favourite route and it felt so good to feel up to running again. Two weeks of feeling rubbish with a cold and a cough has meant I haven't done any running for a while. Came home and baby had woken up from her nap, so I've been entertaining her and trying to send a few emails this afternoon, as well as chatting with d - it is lovely to have her around again. It's been great to feel I have enough energy to bustle around doing these things and just feel better in myself. On the downside I haven't really eaten any meals so far today, due to the hustling around. That's not good. I've made a macaroni cheese and broccoli bake for tea so I will definitely eat some of that. Eating hasn't been so good over the last two weeks due to my loss of appetite through being ill and also the low mood I've had. I need to get myself back on track before it spirals into anything worse. Maybe I'll mention it to my therapist tomorrow, although I don't want to get into a big discussion about it (too much else to talk about). I'll just tell her it's not been great but I'm going to make an effort to make it better this week.

Doc ID: 24827, distribution: 0.04448855421750817 ; Question: what was it like being a sugar baby? Answer: not great. yeah the money is fuckin' nice, a few sessions allowed me to put new tires on my car (SNORT it was a lease and i had to give it back anyways ugh) & i went on a trip (not with the sd but with his $) but ultimately in my experience money aint worth it to be pretty much trapped for an extended period of time with a man you dont know well enough or trust. you have to keep up a constant facade, a perfectly curated persona of your ideal self. its very calculating and mentally exhausting. generally i hate all old men and want to drink their blood but being a sugar baby means making that old man feel like he's the most intelligent, personable, interesting motherfucker in the world. its a delicate dance and it can be dangerous. i was taken advantage of when i was inexperienced & my health was compromised on the greatest scale so it just wasnt worth it personally. id rather sit at a desk and waste away and read/watch whatever i want whenever i want yano. it'd probably appeal to me a little still if i didnt have my boyfriend bc my brain would probably be like OH U CAN DO A BETTER JOB THIS TIME bc naturally u do better the longer u do things i guess, and i always think i can outsmart these men but the truth of the matter is you cant sometimes. cant always predict them.

Doc ID: 16747, distribution: 0.40676338116434474 ; Question: How is the baby doing so far with the transition? When she came to stay with you did you know she would be leaving? Will you get to visit her ever after she leaves? Do you like the adopters? My daughter is around the same age and I have felt so sad and nervous for you guys all week.  Answer: Aw thankyou, thoughtful anon. So many questions‚Ä¶. let me answer them one by one.Baby is doing great with the transition so far. As we have progressed, she has had some periods of being unsettled when the adopters and me are all around, as she can sense something is changing and she is confused by who she wants and the different pulls on her emotions.When she came to stay with us, it was as a foster placement, so we always knew she would be moving on sooner or later. The government target is  weeks from court order for placement to final decision, so we had a rough idea she'd be with us  months or so, but you just never know. Things can change, she could have moved much earlier to a foster-to-adopt placement.Yes we have some scheduled visits after she leaves. Recent research has shown that contrary to what standard practice used to be, foster carers visiting the child soon after placement helps the child settle in their new placement. It reassures them that their attachment figures haven't abandoned them, while they are still building their new attachment with their adopters. Also the adopters comforting them through the grief the baby naturally feels and expresses after seeing their precious foster carers helps build the baby's attachment bond with the adopters.The adopters are lovely. We really like them. They are quite young and so full of energy, warmth and enthusiasm. We have got on with them really well and hope that after baby moves to them, and after we have done all our scheduled visits, they will still keep in touch with us.Thankyou for thinking of us, it is really a difficult and draining time with a lot of mixed emotions xx

 im sick of my dad belittling me and telling me i dont know anything about shit and going into my garden and ripping shit up/taking shit down/changing things that i know i need. you literally cant tell me im a dumbass that doesnt know what im doing. i know that these plants need to be at  degrees. but go ahead keep turning off and now breaking MY ac units when im away from home. ill just let my plants fry at  degrees because dad says so and doesnt think that air conditioning is necessary in a literal fucking sauna in the summer 
 like im supposed to be getting along with him because im stuck at his house, stuck driving one of his old banged up discarded cars to school, stuck GOING to school because he payed for classes and now im obligated to not waste his money, stuck with fried ass plants that wont make me any money because hes been sabotaging my garden for the past / months every time i go to sleep or leave the house for more than  minutes. i literally cant do any better for myself rn and i cant relocate and things arent TERRIBLE here but i would STILL rather fucking kill myself or kill him before i go back to feeling like an autonomy-less fucking child that he insists on treating me like. im sick of him trying to control every aspect of my life and treat me like im a clueless fucking idiot. the hypocrisy is so fucking real its making me mad. im still miserable. i dont care how ‚Äúproud‚Äù my family is of me for ‚Äúdoing the right conventional thing‚Äù i think its fucking stupid as fuck that i have to perform these tricks and jump thru stupid ass fucking hoops just to make anyone proud. i dont even want the pride. or the family. i dont want any of this shit anymore i dont want responsibility for a ghetto ass half ass garden that i cant even keep regulated and thats not gonna yield me any results. i dont even fucking want this laptop he just bought me 
 ive been getting by with outdated technology and cheap stuff that i could afford myself for years but it was putting me behind in school not having a working laptop or printer. and he handed my brother EVERYTHING he has. for the entirety of his life my brother has been a spoiled brat and all the $$ my dad makes went into my brother's hobbies and wants and gifts.  
 the last thing i want to sound like is ungrateful because im not. i cant even believe how nice the laptop is, ive wanted an msi forever. obviously i love it but ive had it for a day and im already realizing id rather not even have it just because of the implications of owing him. i cant even fucking stand him. one moment hes reasonable and the next he's making me want to commit murder because his cognitive dissonance is so thick is suffocates me.  
 so now i have this nice ass laptop that i feel guilty and ashamed of for even having. i feel undeserving. like my only worth is to perform well at school so the family can be at peace knowing im ‚ÄúoN tHe riGhT pAtH‚Äù. my happiness or my sanity or my interests will never fucking matter or be a good enough reason to earn anything whether it be respect or a laptop. its only ever about how things ‚ÄúSEEM to be going‚Äù. so as long as i can SEEM like im doing fine, everything in my dad's small, dumbass world, are. but im not doing fine. im still self harming. im actually self harming more frequently lately than i have in a long run of years. im still brimming with rage because nobody ever listens to me and when i do speak i get told im wrong and or unwise and or ungrateful and or inexperienced and or just plain fucking stupid. im over it. im sick of trying to appease a bunch of people who make my skin crawl. i dont care if its family and they ‚Äúlove me and want the best for me‚Äù. theyre all fucking stuck in their ways with piss and shit for brains and any complaint about unhappiness or discord in the home just gets shut down and band-aid'ed with ‚Äúbuh buh but!!! scKOOL!!! it will give u sense of PurPosE‚Äù ‚Äúbuh but focus on the GUD IN UR LIFE (which is‚Ä¶ btw..?)‚Äù ‚Äúbuh buh heres an excuse as to why your grown ass father can act like an immature damaged joke of a human but you're required to grow personally and gracefully until the point where youve done SO MUCH personal growth that you realize that life is still futile regardless and you eventually snap and off yourself!!!‚Äù 
 if i kill myself now or if i kill myself down the line the result is just gonna be the same and i dont know why or how i put effort into leading my life anyways and suffering for now when i know in my heart of hearts that i want to go at my own hand and im probably going to still feel the same way no matter how many years pass.  
 
 
 sorry if this bothers anyone or concerns anyone (pls dont b lol) but i have nowhere else to say this and no friends to take this to and my boyfriend is obviously still useless when it comes to providing emotional support so here i am 
 
 idk all i can think about is ‚Äúif u dont eat youll feel better‚Äù and i know that ill get some sort of sick sense of satisfaction but i also know how pointless self sabotage is. but when every other aspect of ur life feels sabotaged outside of ur control, then does it rly matter? 
 today i havent denied myself any food. i spent the last of the money i had on food. but thats.. thats it.  
 i have no more money rn so i dont even have the means to eat. i wanna be clear here that my dad does NOT pay for everything, he payed for my schooling only ( classes at a community college, he practically BEGGED me to go) and he purchased me a laptop to aid in my schooling. yes i have a financial safety net (tbh if ur gonna MAKE kids thats kinda ur job until theyre self sufficient but anyways) im still responsible for feeding and taking care of my animals and myself and paying all my own bills, electricity included. so yeah. food is lookin like a no go right now.  
 i have a  hour class tomorrow from  to  pm. im gonna see if i can make it through the day without eating because once i feed myself THEN i get hungry. if i just abstain entirely i can get over the hunger.  
 i have noticeably gained weight and i am extremely uncomfortable in my body right now. im used to my stomach being perfectly flat and now i have a bit of body fat on me so i feel like ive been spilling out of my pants the past few weeks. its not a good feeling. i have no means to comfort myself rn so maybe getting my body back to how im used to it being will bring me comfort. i always thought i wanted to put on a few lbs and fill out more but now that i have i feel totally out of place in my skin. i hate having to be hyperaware of sucking my stomach in. once you get used to having a flat stomach i guess you take it for granted. the self consciousness and a lack of funds for food have me feelin like this week is about to be a long one. theyre all long. i just want a break. i just want to feel happy and comfortable with my life and with my plants situation and my decisions but im not gonna while im living here. im gonna be stuck in this shitty ass spot for as long as it takes for me to get through college, hone an entire craft that idek if im passionate about, and then find another  to  thatll probably have more cons than pros to showing up and wasting away at for  hours a day even if im ‚Äúdoing what i love‚Äù. what i love is to go about my life unbothered. what i would love, is to not have to participate in this rat race at all. what if i dont want to have a purpose. what if ive already accepted my wasted potential and im perfectly happy doing nothing????

Doc ID: 24732, distribution: 0.04055507354297222 ; Question: Forgive me if this comes off badly but lately everytime you mention your bf it's been in a negative light. I get that breaking up or leaving isnt always an option especially since I don't expect you to give the internet every detail of your relationship, but have you. fixing my car himself the  times it's been hit in the last year, helping me save money, helping me start an online business, helping with my grow & all the plants every other day when hes in the same state as me.  He's extremely neurotypical and I'm not so learning how to work together as a team can be challenging because we both have a lot of room to grow and we're very different - but we have a special bond and we're both very similar and committed to one another. The relationship has an added layer of difficulty because he does move back and forth between here and Cali so oftentimes we go months apart which can be challenging but even from k miles away if I really need his help, I have it. I dont think I deserve to be falsely broken up with repeatedly but his immature ass doesnt mean what he says and for some reason still wants to try to make this work so like anyone comitted to their DBS affliction, I'm gonna ride this one out and see where it goes. The last few days our communication has been better/more open so I'm really hoping that the mutual respect he claims to have for me becomes apparent. I really appreciate you being so gently concerned for my wellbeing and happiness. All the past relationships I've been in have been blatantly lacking and abusive and this is the first one I've been in that hasnt been entirely lacking and abusive so its hard for me to gauge when its time to give up.

My sleep has been horrible. And im getting bad dreams and im getting hypnopompic hallucinations, usually about my dog. Im tired as hell. I feel burnt out after working on the art piece. I finished it btw:Over the month of April while working on it my bulimia was dipping its toes in the water, recovery was rocky. But once i finished it my ed cannonballed in and Ive been in relapse ever since. I dont have support here. Never did. And going to therapy isnt really. I mean how tf do i go to a therapist when i cant even leave the house. I havent been in years so i need to go through the process again I dont have the energy for it. I know i need it though, my mind has been falling into dark places..All i have the energy to do now is sit on my ass, and play Witcher  for  hours at a time. I got shit to do but my brain says its a no from me. And i keep blowing money on my ed behaviors so im trying to stop but The Need‚Ñ¢ is intense Feeling like a lost cause..

Ive been binging daily. But there isnt much I can really do about it, my environment has always had an impact on my ed and until the environment changes, my ed wont change. So i just have to live with the ed behaviors until its time to work on recovery again when life allows it. But i cant stop thinking about food and food delivery. RIP.What are y'all doing to stay sane?Ive been working on art, organizing my website and my art instagram. Trying to make more sales lol i have some big art projects to begin but i think im intimidated by them. Lots of cleaning as my family couldnt care less about the outbreak and im an at risk individual so i have to care for my own safety here. Theres no way I would live through it. Randomly bleached my hair the other day for funsies. Gonna do it again tomorrow (i have dark hair and i need more bleach to get out the brassy color) might chop it and put in tinsel too because fuck it who the fuck cares. Trying REALLY hard not to depression shop. I always go crazy with online shopping during depressive episodes and Im really trying to avoid it this time.Still enjoying The Witcher  it helps me calm down and relax and not think about any troubles. Im also chipping my way through the  DOOM but that game is nuts and I really need to be ready to feel the rage and adrenalin when I play. I lean more towards relaxation than aggression.

And I know i would be safe under a  but now really isnt the time to go to the ER or a facility packed with people. Big yikes.

 why would i do that when i literally just made .+k in  minutes. it cant be reasoned.

 everything happens for reasons mans i dont understand it or know why but life is always aligning for me at the very very very last seconds in every circumstance and scenario‚Ä¶ just gotta trust the process i guess. its so gratifying to finally have big results. here i was pattin myself on the back for finding a new employer but ironically enough ive come to the conclusion (of course the day im expected to come in for training‚Ä¶ always last minute) that i can finally get away with employing myself for the time being instead w/ no worries.. makes me wanna cry lol. i was gonna go in just to be professional but if i go for a day im going to have to go for a whole week or two to collect a paycheck and i already know i dont want to do a week or two so im just gonna disappear n hope they forget about me. i just reconnected with one of the og's of all things blackmarket out here who basically knows everyone worth knowing n already got recommendations (aka guaranteed hire) to better dispensaries if i decide thats what i wanna do.  feels weird af to even have these options lol. im gonna eat some fruit, smoke a hash joint, go lay in the sun n then shower. my girlfriends, all two of them, have been petty passive patties to me lately but thats okay im literally not even worried about them bc i can now occupy myself with all the plots and plans i have now that im in a financially breathable spot and can plot and plan. i blocked my copycat friend up and down, and evryone she knows, (or so i thought) and it literally took her less than  hrs to notice, figure it out, and text me. i found the weasle and blocked her too LOL. my other remaining friend has  interest in my life and only her own so i dont blame her ima just return the favor

Doc ID: 21727, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. It started out pretty good and slowly got worse. I felt positive in the morning but I slowly got more anxious as the day went on and my family meeting got closer. The meeting was hard and it made me really anxious for a lot of reasons. I felt really bad about myself today and struggled with self harm urges. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22106, distribution: 0.7027746031871177 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. It's the first okay day I've had in a while so I'm grateful for that. My doctors want me to try ect and I think I'm going to do it. The staff has been really amazing and supportive and I appreciate them so much.

Doc ID: 18660, distribution: 0.05477743626596227 ; Question: I don't want this to come out the wrong way because I know people who are in the middle of the school semester go inpatient and still have to do their school work when they're there but I just feel like where you've been inpatient for so long registering for classes, taking classes, doing midterms is all good things and if someone was to see these posts it would seem like you weren't inpatient but you are and it just confuses me because if you're doing all these accomplishments wouldn't it... Answer: {continued} be a sign that you don't need that level of care. But if you do in fact need it for safety and such shouldn't you not be taking on high stress things like signing up and taking classes while entering your th month in a short term inpatient unit?hi! these are all good questions and i've honestly thought about it too. the original idea behind taking classes was to add structure to my day and have me thinking about the future. i'm only taking two classes and they only meet once a week. the workload has been very manageable and i'm working on getting accommodations. the classes don't really stress me out much because it's very low stakes and i'm treating it as more of an activity or just a learning opportunity. i'm not sure where i am in terms of readiness for discharge but i just got my privileges back after two weeks of increased supervision.

Doc ID: 22036, distribution: 0.6991650283927633 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't very good. We had weights done in the morning and that put me in a bad morning mood. Then the staff started getting on my nerves because I wanted space and they wouldn't leave me alone. My friend is having a really hard time right now and I'm doing my best to support her. I have ect tomorrow and I'm dreading it bc I got a really bad headache last time. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21672, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was super boring. I got put back on level one so I couldn't go on the fresh air walks and I had to miss some groups. I slept for part of the day and just sat around for the rest of it. Overall, it was a pretty shitty day and I'm glad it's over. I hope tomorrow is better. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19523, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was fine. It was boring and I was really anxious again. I ended up taking meds for it bc it was so bad. I also did some ice dives and that helped. The staff here has been really great and they've helped me so much. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19636, distribution: 0.45176945514603495 ; Day  was okay. I can't believe I've been here  days (technically  if I count the day I was admitted). There was a lot of drama on the unit today with a patient yelling slurs at staff and punching walls. It wasn't great for my anxiety but I was able to distract myself by spending time with friends. I'm just getting so bored here and I've been to the same groups so many times that there's basically no point in listening to the same things over and over again. I'm also frustrated because they won't give me a pass to go to a funeral tomorrow and I get it on some level but also I would be with family the entire time and it's not like I would be going out to do something fun. Whatever. I'm just getting annoyed at everything at this point. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19662, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was one of my best days. I got moved up to level three, which means I can go on walks with family on hospital grounds. My parents brought my dogs and it was so nice to see them. My friend left this morning and I miss her. I spent most of the day going to groups and spending time with friends. I'm isolating less and that's good. I had a good night and I'm optimistic about the rest of the week. I also learned that another one of my favorite staff members is leaving and I'm sad about that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19767, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I'm sad but also happy for her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21961, distribution: 0.242600285374038 ; Question: i don't know how to ask this but did you go there willingly? what's it like? i need help and i'm scared  Answer: Hey! Making a decision about whether to go to the hospital is really tough and scary. It's a very personal decision and know that the staff there will be there to support you and keep you safe. It's hard to ask for help but you are so worth it and there are people who love you and care about you. Ultimately, going willingly is generally better because you want to be engaged in your treatment but it's also okay if you don't go willingly. Try not to feel ashamed about how you end up in the hospital and focus more on your recovery and moving forward. The first time I was hospitalized I went sort of willingly and sort of unwillingly. Basically, I was told by my achool's counseling center that I could go on my own or they would pink slip me (which basically means force me to go). I was then brought to the ER where I was formally pink slipped. This time, I was supposed to start a partial hospitalization program and the intake person suggested that I go inpatient instead. I agreed because I thought it would be best for me and I do not regret my decision.Each day follows the same basic structure but has different groups and activities. The first hospital didn't have groups so it was really boring. They try to keep us pretty busy here so we have groups and activities most of the day. The morning starts with breakfast at am and ends with wrap-up group at pm. I was pretty scared my first few days here but I've slowly adjusted and found my way. I've been here for quite some time now so I've gotten to know the staff and the other patients. We get a lot of free time and the groups and activities are never mandatory. They do take attendance and attendance is strongly encouraged but you're never forced to go. Unfortunately, it still gets boring around here even with the groups and activities. I've found that it's helpful to get to know the other patients because they get what you're going through and you can all support each other. I've met some really great people here and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to be at such a wonderful hospital. Please don't hesitate to send in more questions or DM me if that's easier for you. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I have plenty of time to do so. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19779, distribution: 0.7494651587696507 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty awful. I barely slept last night so I woke up in a bad mood. Then I saw that a nurse complained about me on her Twitter and that made me feel like shit. I spent most of my day in my room crying and listening to sad music. My friends visited for a bit and that was nice. I just couldn't really enjoy anything today. I was super anxious and depressed and had a headache. It was just a really bad day. And my nurse is going to do a blind weight tomorrow and I'm anxious about that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19812, distribution: 0.4013430626338419 ; Day  of inpatient was very mixed. I woke up in a bad mood and that got worse bc my doctor thinks I should go to a state hospital and that felt shitty. I just feel like they're giving up on me. My day got better and I went to a lot of groups so that was a good distraction. The day started to get worse when I was trying to explain racism and cultural appropriation and people weren't listening and we being defensive. I got frustrated and went back to my room and sent them a bunch of articles bc I do not have the energy to put in the emotional labor of educating people about racism. Then I got sent a bunch of apologetic texts and I felt like they just wanted me to absolve them of their white guilt. I was just very irritable today. I hope tomorrow is better. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19642, distribution: 0.21106283572532952 ; Question: What happened during the meeting? I'm sorry about the family friend üòû Answer: The meeting just made me really anxious because it was my social worker, my nurse, and the DMH representative all in the same room and the DMH lady was asking me a bunch of questions and I was too anxious to say anything so my nurse and social worker helped answer things and it was weird to hear them talking about me but I'm glad they were there to help. It also just kind of hit me how serious this is because I've been downplaying the severity of my symptoms and I'm so used to living like this that it feels normal even though it's really not. Basically everyone agreed that I'm not safe enough to step down to a less restrictive program or live at home and do outpatient stuff. My nurse and I also tried to explain that living at home with my parents is not a good idea and a residential program would be better but the DMH lady didn't seem to understand that. I just know that being at home with my parents would make my mental health worse. The goal is to keep me out of a state hospital and to be able to use DMH services (if they determine that I'm eligible, which hopefully they will). Unfortunately, I might not be approved and even if I do get approved, it takes a long time to put those services in place so I'm going to be stuck here for the foreseeable future. Idk the meeting kinda just made me feel more hopeless because I'm finally starting to realize how bad things really are and it's scary. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19279, distribution: 0.7088140468370839 ; Day  of inpatient was hard. I slept through most of it because I just couldn't deal.

I'm a little anxious as the weekend approaches because those are usually hard for me but I'm hoping for the best. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21385, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was really good! I had a good meeting with my doctor, which was a pleasant surprise. I got to spend time with friends and I got to know some more people. I went to almost all of the groups today and they were all really good. Overall, today was one of my best days here and I'm so grateful for all the friends I've made here and the amazing staff.

Doc ID: 19530, distribution: 0.6063824422007661 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I was greatly anxious for most of the day but I was able to keep myself distracted. I had two visits today and that was nice but also made me anxious. I worked on a puzzle for most of the day and also talked to some friends from school and that was good. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19575, distribution: 0.24591900723224439 ; Question: I'm always curious about people's inpatient stays because I've never gone but feel like sometimes I might need to but I never know how to get there or what to say :/ Have all of your stays been from a section? Or did you bring yourself there? How long has each one been? How do you know when you need to leave? Have you ever wanted to leave but they said no or wanted to stay and they made you leave? Sorry for all the questions :( Answer: Hi! You don't have to apologize for asking questions. I don't mind answering them and I have nothing else to do. I didn't really have a choice with any of my hospitalizations but technically only one of my stays was because of a section. Basically my therapist asked me if I would agree to go or if she would have to ‚Äúpink slip‚Äù me, which is what they call it in Ohio. I agreed to go and they took me to the ER and the ER sectioned me even though I said I would go inpatient. The other three hospitalizations have been voluntary on paper but in those situations it was more of a ‚Äúyou can agree to go or we will make you go‚Äù so it wasn't really that voluntary. It just shows up differently on your records. My first hospitalization (the pink slip one) was only  hours. That hospital was terrible so I lied my way out of there (I do not recommend doing this because I just ended up getting hospitalized a month later). The second hospitalization was about a month and a half. The third one was about two weeks. The current hospitalization is two months and counting. I don't really know how I know when I need to leave. I don't particularly want to be here but my treatment team determines when I am ready to leave. I really don't have any say in any of that. I could sign a three-day, which would mean that they have three business days to evaluate whether or not I need to stay and they will either discharge you or section you. I was told that I would just get sectioned if I try to sign one so I'm not going to bother. I have wanted to leave many times and they won't let me. I've never wanted to stay and been kicked out because they would be liable if anything happened to me after discharge. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19773, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't great. I didn't sleep well last night and my depression was bad so I spent most of the day sleeping or isolating in my room. My parents visited and brought me dinner so that was nice. It was just a very boring day. I got anxious toward the end of the night and my headache got worse. I was really anxious about the blind weight but I talked to my nurse and that was nice. I'm trying not to worry about it but it's hard. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19952, distribution: 0.3583507130239038 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. I woke up pretty early and hung out with my roommate and that was nice. We talked about our lives and got to know each other. We're very different people but we were still able to connect and bond. The weekends here are kinda quiet and there isn't much to do so I spent a lot of time just sitting around. My friend and her mom came to visit and that was fun. The afternoon and evening were tough for me. I'm still struggling with self harm and eating. They tried to get me to drink ensure but I really don't like the taste so I didn't drink it. I was eventually able to force myself to eat some pizza so that's progress. My mood was pretty low today but hopefully it'll get better soon. I'm also not sleeping very well here and that's been a struggle. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19376, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was good. I went to a lot of groups and kept busy for the whole day. I wanted to nap but I spent time with friends instead so I'm proud of myself for that. I did some more drawing and ordered some more art supplies bc the ones here aren't very good. I had some good conversations with staff and that was nice. I'm hoping that my meeting with my treatment team goes well tomorrow. I have some things I want to talk about and I hope that they're willing to listen bc sometimes it feels like they just dismiss me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19537, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was actually really good. Weekends here are usually super boring and my closest friends were both out on pass for most of the day and I was worried about being alone but it was a surprisingly good day. I ended up meeting some of the new patients and making more friends and that was nice. My parents visited and I got to see my dogs and then my friends came back and we played games and just talked. My depression and anxiety were both very manageable today and I had a really good conversation with a staff member.

I went to group and then on a walk and then hung out with my roommate. I had a visitor who brought me dinner and we played cards. Then I went to art group and talked to a staff member about musicals. Now I'm just chilling in my room. My mood was pretty okay and my anxiety was not great but not awful. Everything was manageable today and that's progress. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19459, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  was kind of garbage. I woke up and was in a bad mood. Then my roommate got moved to a different room and we got along well so that sucked. I had a phone call with the department of mental health and that made me feel worse. I slept for most of the morning just to avoid everything. I spent the afternoon with friends and some friends from school visited me. I also had to deal with some invalidating stuff about my gender and that made me more upset. It was just a bad day. I'm glad I got to see my friends though. I'm also glad that I have friends on the unit who support me.

Doc ID: 19860, distribution: 0.638791663197603 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I distracted myself for most of the day so my mood was okay. I wrote some more stuff and spent time with friends and my aunt came to visit. I let the staff read my writing and it was really scary but I think it's a step in the right direction. They've been telling me that it's helped them understand me better because I'm not always comfortable saying how I'm feeling out loud. Writing is just easier for me and it feels good to let it out. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19288, distribution: 0.6803385206493668 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I am trying to appreciate the little things and I think I have become less critical when it comes to rating my days here. The past few days were really rough for me and I honestly hit a low point. Before this weekend I would have said that today was shitty but now in comparison it was a good day. I got off of one to one supervision and I can't express how amazing it felt to be able to use the bathroom and take a shower without someone watching me the entire time. I was still restricted to one hallway but I was allowed to go to groups and staff members and patients were allowed to talk to me. Two days in complete isolation was very difficult for me and I'm so happy to be done with that. I'm hoping to gain back some more privileges tomorrow. I'm going to try really hard to make healthy choices for myself and making those choices has always been a big struggle for me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21898, distribution: 0.5590155951175775 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty bad. I got taken down to ect early which I thought would be good because I'd get it over with. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to take my premed so I got a horrible headache after and it lasted the whole day. They also increased the settings and that didn't help. I didn't end up going to any groups because I felt too crappy. Today marks the beginning of my fifth week here and I'm starting to get really sick of seeing the same twenty people every day with no way to escape or avoid certain people. The staff has been really great (most of the time) and I'm so grateful for everything they do. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19824, distribution: 0.23911145601632178 ; Day  of inpatient was bad but there were some happy moments too. The morning was pretty rough. The racist and homophobic and transphobic and anti Semitic guy was complaining about me and my friends even though all we did was walk past him. He accused us of taunting him and trying to provoke him. Then he started calling my friend ‚Äúthe bitch who looks like a heroin addict‚Äù and that was the last straw. I walked out of the room we were in and stood across from him (with staff in between) and yelled at him and called him a ‚Äúfucking bigot‚Äù and then staff got mad at me and escorted me to a different wing of the hospital. It was also Chinese New Year today so my parents visited and brought Chinese food and that was nice. I'm just angry and frustrated and the people here are really great (for the most part) but it's just hard when you're stuck around the same people for so long and there aren't many lounges or places to go. I hope tomorrow will have less drama. Maybe they'll only have to call security once as opposed to the three times they called today. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22204, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was the best one yet! I got moved up to level three, which means my dogs can visit me and I can get passes to leave the unit. The highlight of my day was seeing all three of my dogs and getting to walk them around the hospital grounds. I ate a lot of food today and I'm proud of myself for that. I struggled a little after but I forced myself to stay in open areas and used some of the coping mechanisms I've learned here. Overall, it was a really great day and I'm so grateful for the staff and my safety. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19329, distribution: 1.0 ; Days  and  of inpatient were okay. Day  wasn't very good. I had an okay day but still slept for most of the day shift. The evening was hard and I self harmed again. I've been feeling pretty shitty physically in addition to mentally because of the whole concussion situation. Day  was better. I spent time with friends for most of the day. The weather was nice so the walks were fun. I got to see my dogs. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19619, distribution: 0.4878093534286678 ; Days  and  were mixed. I forgot to write yesterday so I'm combining it with today.  was okay for most of the day but got worse later in the day. The weather was really nice so we got to go on two walks and also sit on the porch. I tried to isolate less and was somewhat successful but it still wasn't great. I've realized a pattern where I pretend to be happy and bubbly during the day when I'm with my friends or just isolate so no one sees me and then it all just hits me at night and things get bad. I'm going to try to not do that as much.  was really good. My anxiety and depression were very manageable and I got to see my dogs. I spent most of the day out of my room and spending time with friends. We wrote little notes for the staff to thank them for everything and I think they really liked it so that made me happy. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19960, distribution: 0.4431547732546672 ; Admit day and day  of inpatient were not great but they started to get better. Admit day was pretty awful and there wasn't much to do. I spent most of the day in the clinical evaluation center and I didn't really talk to anyone. I mostly stayed in my room. Day  was okay. I struggled with self harming and stayed in my room for the first half. I didn't do great with eating either. I started to meet more people toward the end of the day and that's been really nice. I like everyone and it's making my time here easier. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19873, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was bad for most of the day but it got better in the evening. I slept for a long time and spent a lot of time in bed. Again. I ended up writing a little bit and that helped me process some things. My friends and I ordered food for dinner and that was fun. I'm dreading the weekend because they're always super boring. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19503, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I didn't do much this morning. I went to all of the groups in the afternoon and I liked most of them. I had a fun time just doodling and drawing things for staff. I didn't feel great today but I was able to distract myself for most of the day. The night got really hard for me but my nurse helped me a lot so that's good. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22286, distribution: 0.1604990092710319 ; Day  of inpatient started out pretty bad but it got better as the day went on. I had a meeting with my parents, my social worker, and my psychiatrist and it was really stressful and didn't go well. I wanted to self harm after but I talked to staff instead and they helped me. I made a new friend today and I'm becoming better at advocating for myself and talking to the staff when I need to. As always, I'm grateful for the friends I have here and the amazing staff. I honestly couldn't do it without them. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22069, distribution: 0.5757133205223192 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I had ect in the morning and felt pretty groggy after. I also had a bad headache that lasted the whole day and my throat was really sore. I napped for a bit and tried to go to some groups but I was kinda out of it. My mood was pretty good after ect and other than the physical pain it's been a pretty good day. I say this a lot but I'm so grateful for the amazing staff and the other patients I've met here. I couldn't have asked for a better or more supportive group of people. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19677, distribution: 0.1846305425151225 ; Question: I've never been inpatient before... what's it like where you are?  Answer: I've only been in two different places so I don't really have much to compare but I'll try my best. I was admitted involuntarily to an inpatient hospital near where I go to school (in a different state). That hospital didn't have any groups or activities during the day and we weren't allowed in our rooms unless we were sleeping. They also didn't have psychiatrists or therapists. Basically there was one large room where all the patients sat together and watched tv all day. That hospital was pretty bad. The one I'm in now is supposedly the best psychiatric hospital in the US. I've been to this inpatient unit three times now and it's very nice compared to the other one. Our day is very structured and we have different activities we can go to (but we're not forced to). We have several groups each day like CBT, DBT, ACT, art therapy, walks, music, and more. We are also assigned a psychiatrist and a social worker to coordinate everything while we're there and also aftercare planning. Let me know if you have any other questions! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19921, distribution: 0.37132341606210517 ; Day  of inpatient started out really bad but got better at night. I got woken up by my treatment team and I was super groggy for awhile. A lot of shit went down today with other patients and some of it was triggering so my anxiety was bad. My depression was also really bad today and I spent most of the afternoon/evening in my room. I eventually felt a little better and hung out with my friends. We listened to music and played cards and ordered ice cream and it was fun. It's my friend's last night and I'm happy for her but it's hard to see all my friends go home while I'm still here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19915, distribution: 0.42350480978790894 ; Day  of inpatient was weird. I woke up early and felt really energized and I was super productive. I felt good for most of the day but there was always the thought at the back of my head that the good feeling wasn't going to last and that I would eventually crash and burn. I managed to make it through most of the day feeling okay but it hit me hard at night. I felt the worst that I've felt since I've been here and it was really hard. I was barely moving or communicating with the staff and it was overall not a good situation. I agreed to take a PRN after a lot of encouragement and I feel a little better now. I'm mostly just tired. They wouldn't let me go to my room because they didn't think I was safe enough so they kept me in open areas. The meds they gave me are kicking in and I am super tired. Hopefully I'll feel more stable and regulated tomorrow. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19940, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I got moved up to level  so I was finally allowed to go on walks. I spent a lot of time with friends today and that was nice but it kind of all hit me at night and I just ended up being exhausted and feeling crappy. I'm just having a lot of really negative thoughts and I can't make them stop. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19897, distribution: 0.5046838076034188 ; Day  of inpatient was weird. It started out really bad because I didn't sleep well last night. I was supposed to wake up early and stay out of my room today but that didn't happen. The day sort of got better but it also felt like I was dreaming the entire time. My friends visited and it was nice but I few like I wasn't really present for it at all. My mood wasn't great today but it wasn't too bad. I mostly felt numb and empty and I don't know if that's better or worse than the usual depressed mood. Oh well. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19559, distribution: 0.8698165079325755 ; Day  of inpatient was kind of weird but not necessarily in a bad way. I didn't sleep well so I was up early. We didn't have anything scheduled in the morning so I did my laundry, cleaned my room, changed my sheets, and hung up pictures and posters. It was a very productive morning but I was also really anxious. I had a doctor's appointment outside of the hospital so I got to go on pass for that. It was weird being off the unit and around so many people. I've been really anxious lately and I don't know why. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19786, distribution: 0.2718050853154904 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. I was in a really good mood this morning bc my friend shipped me my chest binder and it felt really good to wear it. I met with my treatment team and they said that I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Also my insurance company denied tms treatment but the doctor said he would do it for free. A lot of my friends (patients) left today and I'm happy for them but I'll miss them. It's also hard to see so many people come here after me and leave before me. I spent a lot of the day crying bc so many people were leaving. It was my favorite staff member's last shift tonight and that was super hard for me. She was the first staff member I met and the first one I trusted. It's bittersweet bc I know that she's moving on to a better job but I'm going to miss her so much. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19891, distribution: 0.44047288398735385 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. The morning and afternoon weren't great. I slept in late and didn't go to many of the groups. I stayed in my room for a lot of the day and I had really bad anxiety for most of it. One of the other patients was yelling at the staff and kicking things and men yelling is a trigger for me so that was difficult. Things got a lot better at night. I spent time with my friends and with staff and it was just really fun and a nice distraction. It's weird how normal things feel here. Sometimes I forget that I'm in a psych hospital. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19494, distribution: 0.857349174181409 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty shitty. I was really tired so I slept for most of the morning. I had a meeting with one of the tms doctors and it didn't go well. I tried to go to some groups in the afternoon but I didn't end up going to that many. My night was hard. I'm so tired of being here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19867, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was ok. I was really anxious but I managed to stay out of my room for most of the day. I did some more writing and it was helpful. I don't feel great because I'm still super anxious but it was an ok day for depression. I'm just getting tired of being here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19686, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was good. I slept better last night so I felt more rested today. My goal was to keep myself busy and out of my room and I was able to do that. I went to almost all of the groups and spent time with friends all day. My parents wanted to visit so I let them and it didn't go well. The rest of the day was good though so I'm trying to focus on that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19591, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient started out really shitty but got a lot better. I woke up late and went back to bed immediately after meeting with the weekend doctor and taking care of ADLs. My dogs were going to visit today but I got dropped a level bc of self harm and other stuff so they couldn't come. That made me upset so I stayed in bed for the whole day shift and barely talked to anyone. I had a visitor and that was nice. My day started to get better after that. I spent the rest of the day playing games with friends and that was fun. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19909, distribution: 0.5001510591412289 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty bad. I woke up a lot later than usual because my anxiety medication made me really tired. I wasn't able to go on any of the walks today because the staff didn't think I was safe to go. They made me stay in open areas the whole day and I was so bored. My aunt and my parents visited and it didn't go well. It was fine with my aunt but my parents said that I would have to pay for residential treatment. I was already having a bad depression day and that just made me feel worse. I already feel like a burden to them and that just made me feel bad. I was able to spend some time with friends and that made me feel better.

Doc ID: 11843, distribution: 0.5582958594932934 ; It is quite rare for all five of us to sit down together and enjoy good food (all vegan because Emily and I were in charge üòâ) and so that is why it really important to just simply enjoy living in the moment. I've never actually appreciated the importance of doing so until now, and wow, it sure does make a HUGE difference.

Today is a day for being gentle to myself and taking it easy. My legs are tired just going up and down stairs (which I do a lot of). The baby and I spent the morning at a soft play centre which is one of my favourite low key things to do because it involves little physical effort from me and the effort it does involve is mostly crawling. I ate  eggs at breakfast instead of my usual two and I'm eating a big bowl of lunch right now. Plus it's Friday so the wine is in the fridge just waiting for it to be a reasonable hour to have a glass. Relaxing is the order for the rest of the day, plus I need to find a recipe for a fabulous seafood starter for a triple birthday meal at friends tomorrow evening.

At the moment my days are centred around marathon training, as you guys know, and so recovery is super important. I'm finding that taking out my new bike is therefore the best way to get out of my head, de-stress and simply move my body without tiring my legs out too much!! üòÖ
-
I also don't own a car at the moment and I don't plan on buying one any time soon, so I love how it gives me the freedom to get myself to places more easily (a full charge in four hours does km, which is such a big range!!), avoid traffic (big win üòâ) and not cost the earth üåø

I'll have to find a name for my bike I think, but definitely go show some love over @momentumbikinguk and check-out what they do üëåüèª They make such cool E-bikes, and you're more than welcome to join me on fun countryside adventure if you decide to get one üòâ

Doc ID: 16398, distribution: 1.0 ; Resting  Today is a rest day on my half marathon training programme. See me resting! No brain, I will not go out and do just a little run. I do not want to get injured. I committed to doing this in a healthy way and I will do my best to stick to that. Also a little part of my brain is still crying about not doing RED January. I was really tempted but I knew I couldn't do that and the half marathon training and stay mentally healthy. Ironic since it's for mental health, but running every day for a month would actually be likely to send me spiralling into a relapse. And that, brain, is why we are not doing it. (I keep having to have this pep talk with myself repeatedly.) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15167, distribution: 1.0 ; I'm going swimming this evening for the first time in almost  months! I'm curious as to how it will feel. Usually when I even miss a week or two, I can feel the difference in the way I move through the water. Surely  months is going to make a big difference. My fitness is still pretty good from all the running I've done, but how my arms will feel is another matter. Also, the pool has limitations on the number of swimmers allowed in and I may not be able to thrash up and down in my usual way. I'm not sure if there's rules on overtaking or not. Basically I hope the fast lane is empty so that I can have it all to myself! We're going earlier in the evening than usual because the gym is closing earlier at the moment, but I don't know how many people will have given up their gym membership over lockdown. I'm not really desperate to go but I'm on a lifetime price freeze for my monthly membership, so I don't want to stop because I'll never get this good a price ever again. Maybe it'll feel better once I get back into the swing of it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7409, distribution: 0.2761248702833179 ; the last time i worked out in our home gym was when i was , after weight restoring and being on absolute exercise restriction for  straight months.
.
.
when i finally reintroduced movement, i had no idea how to do so with grace. i would wake up at  AM to put in a two hour circuit, forcing myself through reps on an empty stomach, wishing i was anywhere but here.
.
.
then i would shower, climb back into bed, and wake around noon for a second workout in this same gym. a long distance run. i hated every second.
.
.
i haven't worked out down here since. today, in the midst of the quarantine chaos, i laced up my sneakers and headed down the stairs. i tied my hair in a ponytail and stared at myself in the mirror. i swore for myself i'd bring happiness and light to this once-toxic space. to this forgotten war zone, where i waged battle against myself every day, twice a day, for years.
.
.
i didn't follow a guide or a streamed workout. i simply turned up my music and had FUN. i lifted things and put them down. i jumped around. i stopped to dance. i took  minutes to be in my own company and to move with love, for myself, an expression of gratitude for all the growth i've undergone.
.
.
today i healed. today i loved. this epidemic, this chaos, this quarantine. it's devastating and flipping all of our lives upside down. but for me, today, it was a small blessing in disguise. it forced me to confront the lingering corners of a dark past, and flash a light into them.
.
.
for the next few days all heal at our own pace be kind. be gentle. be patient.

Doc ID: 2641, distribution: 1.0 ; CARDIO üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è VS üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è WEIGHTS???

I weigh the exact same amount in both photos but my body looks different. That's because the ratio between fat & muscle has changed üí™üèº

On the left: I did only HIIT & cardio-based training! On the right: I do weightlifting & resistance training!

I still do a mix of both to this day, I'm not saying one is good and the other is bad! The great thing about exercise is that there's not just one type of movement you should do. Move your body in ANY way you enjoy! üòª But as a female, I used to be scared to lift weights because I thought I'd get bulky & 'manly'... It really doesn't work that way!

üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Don't be afraid of lifting weights & strength training! Toning up is the act of gaining muscle. This is what gives your body definition. You will not get bulky overnight, gaining muscle takes time!! But this also depends on your genetic makeup. For some, gaining muscle comes more naturally. 

üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Walking is my FAV form of cardio. It's a passive & low-impact way to get your body moving, plus it's amazing for maintaining your overall health. That's why I always start my day with a light walk!

üçΩ To gain muscle, you have to be eating ENOUGH & this usually means you have to eat in a SLIGHT calorie surplus. This gives your body that little bit of extra energy it needs to build muscle.

‚è∞ Give it time. I didn't notice my body changing very much as each day passed, but now that I look back I can definitely see the difference! Remember the paper towel analogy I posted last week!! üòâ

ü•™ Eat enough protein & carbs, they aren't bad! I prioritised my protein intake to ensure I was getting enough. I also didn't avoid carbs at all throughout my entire health & fitness journey. They're the body's preferred energy source! Enjoy them! 

üò¥ Rest & recover! This is where the magic happens. Your body is constantly working hard for you, so giving it that time to actually recover is vital! üõå

Doc ID: 2527, distribution: 1.0 ; With New Years comes the pressure to set New Years resolutions, which used to be the time of year I'd restart a new strict gym / food regime & set myself unrealistic body expectations, but not this year! ü•≥üëá | ad

Idk about you, but I had the Monday blues today: lack of motivation, bloated after all the Christmas/NYE feasting & was honestly just feeling pretty sluggish & bleh.

But when I got to the gym today ‚Äî first session of the year ‚Äî I greeted a lovely man with a disability at the door & he completely refreshed my perspective & mindset. 

First of all, his aura was so positive, he was genuinely happy to be there & because of his disability, he crawled from machine to machine throughout his workout, even though his tremors made it increasingly more difficult, even though it seemed like his limbs worked against him, even though some people sadly stared as he grunted with every movement, he still pushed himself & got his body moving. 

It reminded me what a true blessing it is to be able to move my body. It never deserves punishment, only embracing.

I wanted to thank him for showing me his strength & perseverance, for inspiring me, encouraging me & reminding me of what's truly important. 

I appreciate these legs, for they take me wherever I need to go ü¶µ 

I appreciate my arms, because they hold my fav food, my fav people and all of my fav things üí™ 

I appreciate my tummy, because it homes some of my vital organs, provides warmth to my body & is soft to hug!! ü§ó

I appreciate my stretch marks for proving to me how strong my body is, that it grows, stretches & heals for me.

I appreciate this weird little flesh sack that society tells me should look a certain way even though it literally does so much for me & that in itself is beautiful as heck.

Anyway, just some food for thought going into this week! Maybe it'll inspire you to be thankful for your bod too üòá

I had a vague route planned to stay local to my house but it turned out to be not quite long enough so the last few miles were made up of random running on side streets (all appropriately socially distanced, of course). I think I'd definitely be slightly faster in an actual race with spectators and a defined route - and also if I wasn't so sleep deprived and if I'd been more careful about adequate pre-race nutrition I'm proud of my running achievements over the last three months. I never thought I could run the distances and the speeds I've run. I don't know if I'll ever be able to run a half marathon as fast again as I would have done this one. Certain factors just aligned over these three months that meant I could fully commit to training. Who knows whether that'll happen again. But let me look at the positives - I trained in a healthy way, I didn't get obsessed or let the eating disorder run away with it, I stuck to the training plan, I maintained my weight, I paid attention to my nutrition‚Ä¶ lots of wins there.

I wasn't running because I felt I had to, or because I felt I needed to compensate for anything. Just running for the pleasure of running.  Of course it doesn't feel physically fantastic all the time when I'm actually running. The route I ran is uphill for the first couple of miles and it's hard work, but then it gets easier. After about three miles I got into my stride and was just cruising along feeling good.  Six miles down and I made it home, walked d out to a babysitting job, and then came home and ate a bowlful of creamy lentils and pork (Thankyou hello fresh) The garmin did its thing and I managed to make it record my run and upload it to strava.

.
getting myself to start yoga this morning was so hard. i actually contemplated doing a workout instead of yoga. honestly getting to the gym early in the morning at this point in my life would probably be easier than diving into a yoga sequence. especially ashtanga, one that i've found to be more than bending and jumping.
.
its become more of a mental rather than a physical practice to me. when I resist it, I KNOW my subconscious is trying to stop me from being introspective. it's a telltale sign that my ego is trying to hide and go unnoticed so that I don't put it in check.
.
when i feel like i don't want to do yoga and force myself to do it anyway, feelings (such as unworthiness, feeling small, like a burden to others, feeling unaccomplished) and false beliefs about myself resurface.  these are all things that if left uncovered/undiscovered, pull me into a hole.
.
it's uncomfortable a LOT but so worth it at the end. even if nothing gets solved, even if all I do is realize ‚Äúwow i actually felt like shit because of what happened two weeks ago,‚Äù I am at least % more aware than when I reluctantly began.
.
that's why daily practice to me is so important. I tend to bury feelings and hide from self deprecating thoughts so I don't have to face them. yoga brings everything to the front. yoga (slowly, surely, gradually) brings everything together.

Where strangers became family. Where practicing postures barely scratched the surface of the true meaning of yoga. Where I fell in love with my self again and again in each breath and stretch. I told myself I wasn't allowed to be sad until I left so I can enjoy the moment but my sadness from leaving pales to the gratitude I have for this wonderful time and the excitement I have for each person I met. I am much more happy that we all got to experience this together and I can't wait to see what light you beautiful souls spread throughout your life.

I imagined I was going to do a parkrun, although I didn't run a parkrun route because the parks are so busy at the moment. So I got up and did all the pre-parkrun things I usually do and that helped me get in the mindset of going out to run k. It also made it feel less daunting because I don't really get stressed out before parkruns.  I didn't quite manage it in  minutes, but I was just over  and a half minutes. Strava tells me that is a k PB so I'll take that üôå I think the parkrun where I ran slightly faster probably was measured a bit short as it didn't register as a k on my garmin.

When I'm actually running the half marathon, I will have to think of tutoring at this same distance point and visualise the same situation and whoomf! off I will go. In the end, I made it to . miles before H caught me up in the car. He whizzed me home (I was very grateful!), and I spent an hour tutoring Circle Theorem, before shoving my (cold damp) running clothes back on and running  miles down the road to rescue the car from where I'd parked it at the start of the run. Finally made it home just in time to eat tea cooked by d. Madness, I tell you.

i always knew that i should workout from a place of love, but it honestly didn't fully click in my head until pretty recently.  for my entire life, being active was solely a way to "be better" whether that was through competing in sports, to look a certain way, or to just be ‚Äúfitter‚Äù, which PSA: do not make you better. it wasn't until a few months ago, after i had gone through many phases of complete exercise burnout and around the same time that i went "all in", that i decided to let go of ALL expectations i set for myself in the gym and on how my body looked that my mindset changed. i'm not exactly sure when the switch happened, but my love for movement and this body of mine has never been greater.
‚Äî‚Äî
some weeks, i make it to the gym  times, some weeks, i go  times.¬† EVERY week, i listen to and honor how much and what kind of movement my body wants and always give myself grace because¬†at the end of the day, working out is a celebration, a privilege, and something to be incredibly grateful for üåü

I'm reminding myself missing meals is not helpful and will only make coping with everything else going on more difficult. So I am doing ok, but it's taking effort. I'm also having to give myself grace over running. I like to get out and run a few times a week, but at the moment having a gap in my day to run and having motivation to run are not really coinciding. There's days when I'm not really moving much at all, I think a couple of days I've not even gone outside, which is very unusual for me. But it's only for two weeks and nothing awful will happen to me if I don't run much for two weeks.  Basically adoption transitions are hard and all-consuming. You're looking after a baby, and then you're looking after adults learning to look after the baby. And you're doing it from dawn till dusk day after day. We have all hit a bit of an exhaustion wall today so we are having a very low key afternoon. One more day to do and then a day off, before the final push to the end. I can't even wish for it to be over though because that will mean baby leaving us and that's just sad too. Much emotions.

_______
i noticed a similarity with social media. the more time i spent scrolling through my feed filled with certain images and videos, i found a subconscious pull to shape my own actions and goals to that. whether it was fitness, beauty, fashion, meals, hobbies, etc. the more i surrounded my mind with outside influences, the more i wanted to do the same

_______
i just am more conscious about who i follow and why. i try to not spend too much time ‚Äúwatching‚Äù and ‚Äúabsorbing‚Äù the works of others as it hampers my own creative process/development

for example, this is my body now- without trying to change or shape anything. once i stopped surrounding myself with all the ‚Äúbody‚Äù goals i used to scroll through, i found this new appreciation and acceptance where i am right now
_______
i love appreciating the works of others and sharing their creations with the world. i love raising other people up. i just don't feel the need to label anyone or anything as ‚Äúgoals‚Äù because trends and influences come and go. what stays is that quiet voice that reminds us over and over who we truly are.

Eating has been somewhat better today, although after doing PE with Joe (and d, d and d), I went for a run (my one allowed daily outing for exercise). It was the penultimate run of my half marathon training schedule, a tempo run with  minutes warm up jog then  minutes at fast pace and  minutes cool down jog. My legs were dead, I don't think Joe's PE was a good pre-run idea. For the first time ever in the entire training schedule I skipped the optional extra part of the run, so I only did  minutes fast. Then walked home for the cool down. I didn't eat enough yesterday and I exercised too energetically this morning and it came back to bite me at pm when I crashed out on the sofa. So none of that was great.  On the positive side, the weather was so sunny and warm today, I started to wonder if I should have worn suncream for my run. It's been beautiful and we've been sitting out in the garden enjoying it. I want to write about therapy - last week and this week. I'm hoping I'll have time to do that tomorrow. I am in need of a peaceful day just pottering around rather than frantically trying to do jobs and take phone calls in between the baby's schedule and trying to keep on top of everything as much as I can for the girls. In other news, we got Disney+ yesterday and everyone is very happy. I'm not really bothered about watching it (no time haha) but I'm happy that everyone else is happy. Since the gym is shut, we get a rebate of our gym membership which will more than cover the Disney+ cost so that was our justification. Plus we need things to do in these lockdown times. Of course our daily appointment with Boris at pm. He wanted to be remembered for Getting Brexit Done, and instead he'll be remembered for Getting Us Through The Coronavirus Pandemic. I don't like him and his party and policies but I do think he's doing a pretty good job overall of this. And Chris Whitty and the other guy (Prof someone) will be up for knighthoods when this is all over I'm sure.

Doc ID: 9092, distribution: 1.0 ; ^^ something I've previously said (not sure where but I remember ). and now I see how it can be problematic. i'm thinking about the way I said it and it just sounds like the only way that I can be smoothed into a nicer person is if I physically bend and fold and stretch and move gracefully. yes this is part of yoga but it is not the ONLY way to practice yoga. yoga is a ‚Äúunion‚Äù of body mind and soul that only requires your mental focus and breath. you can be doing yoga and sitting in the car, cleaning the house, or balancing on your big toe on the top of a mountain.

I don't want to only be a nicer person AFTER my asana practice. I want to be a nicer person before, throughout as well as after my practice. my aim is not to have a bad mood, stretch, and all of a sudden the problem is solved‚Äî my aim is to recognize an emotion/reaction, validate it, and move on with a relaxed heart. this is what my daily practice has taught me, although I am human and still get fired up for longer than you'd expect haha

it is kind of true that I am a ‚Äúnicer‚Äù person after the introduction of yoga in my life, but I want the physical practice to be a TOOL to help me move through obstacles in my life off the mat the same way I move through postures in the series.

Ô∏è‚É£. Think about your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: Why are you working out? What is it doing for you? How does it make you feel?  It can be easy to get caught up in the numbers (number of reps, minutes, calories), but thinking about my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù helped me track my progress in a more holistic way.

Ô∏è‚É£. Wear nice workout clothes: This might sound a little silly or materialistic, but when you wear something that makes you feel confident, it can really impact the quality of your workout.  Look good, feel good üòé

Ô∏è‚É£. Be your biggest fan: Chances are, you're your biggest critic. In the end, everything you do in your life is for you. The only person you are competing against is yourself, which means you get to set the rules and standards. Being your biggest fan isn't about bragging or being arrogant.  Rather, it is about showcasing your achievements and giving yourself a pat on the back for the wins in your life, big or small. Because if you don't do it, who will? ‚ú® üì∏: @kaylabarnes

-
 // It's a reason to go outdoors and get fresh air. Personally, the UK spring weather is usually optimal for me: not too hot, not too cold, a bit of a breeze. But whether the heat feels claustrophobic or my butt cheeks are hideously numb, it's fresh air and that's what matters most to me.
-
 // Recently, I'm running with the half marathon in mind. And that means I'm working to beat my previous time, run faster, or run a longer distance. Challenging myself with running has made it so much more exciting and rewarding.
-
 // I think everyone's probably heard of endorphins. With any form of exercise you get that positive feeling afterwards, but for me, endorphins are on an all time high after I run.
-
 // Stress relief. At my desk, there's a million-and-one things going on inside my head all at the same time. Whilst on a run, it's a chance for me to escape that chaotic bubble and just be in my own company.
-
 // Running is for anyone and everyone. For sure you have to train pretty intensely to be a pro runner like Mo Farah, but it's so easy to just put on some trainers and run. And simply run for fun. I also love running to explore and find new places, which is something I loved doing in Australia (except in Darwin . . . yeah, about that üò≠üè•).

Doc ID: 18370, distribution: 1.0 ; TW: mentions of eating disorder, anorexia, over exercising  
 
 Tips for stopping over exercising:  . If you are someone like myself who goes on walks that impulsively become runs, wear jeans/a dress/skirt so you can't run and/or get someone to go on the walk with you  . If you do yoga and you've found you've been going a bit hard at it, do a mindfulness exercise before and after your practice. This way you will be a lot more relaxed and less likely to get riled up and impulsively start doing push-ups or do crow pose too many times. . If you tend to do squats in the shower, something I had an issue with, set timers/alarms for your showers. Doing squats means you take up way more time in the shower, so by setting yourself an alarm you have less time to waste. Also if you are passionate about sustainability it could be useful reminding yourself that long showers aren't too good for the environment. . You gotta stop going to the gym. Just. Stop. Gyms are the best place to get riled up and uncomfortable and start working your body into exhaustion and you need to stay away.  . Give away/get a friend to keep any weights/fitness bands etc so you won't be triggered/tempted by them . If you live with your parents and they are supportive, I highly recommend sleeping in a room close to theirs. My dad once found me at am running back and forth in my room, and only heard me because I had been jumping very loudly beforehand. He didn't hear me before because I had a room far away from his and my mum's room. I have since moved into a closer room and it has stopped all nighttime exercise as they wake up right away . If you are in a team sport, I highly recommend you take some time off, if you haven't already been advised by your psychologist/health team. Although I understand you might love it, recovery has to be your first priority. Recovery has to come first. . If you end up exercising, have an extra snack to compensate. Something substantial like a banana smoothie, a nut/protein bar, yoghurt, avocado toast etc  
 You got this!!!

Answer: Hello Anon.Hope youre doing okay as well!!Bro im an artist i dont know medical science. All i can offer is a really dumbed down version of some thoughts that may or may not be accurate. Are you talking about muscle cramping? I think muscle cramping is connected to what we feed our bodies (and what our bodies are lacking). I would always get achey and sore and also get cramping in my legs and lower back when i was in my ed. Even now that i eat plenty and am at a higher weight i still get cramps now and then. Im probably lacking in specific nutrients or minerals or whatever my body needs. Idk! I also crack my joints and sometimes if i cant get it to pop i get extra aches. I also very little muscle definition and am weak so i get sore easily. Maybe you can relate to any of that?Do you have swelling?Does propping your legs up on a pillow help at all? Theres probably a lot of things it could be. Bad joints? Weak muscles? Maybe physical therapy to build up the strength? Idek. I dont have any answers here. Sorry dude.. If you are able to email a doctor maybe that could help youI have heard many times that when we are deep into ed for a long time and then finally come out of it into recovery, all the medical issues start to show up. :/ Sorry for the long response.

previously i thought exercise was just to be ‚Äúfit‚Äù so i can ‚Äúhave‚Äù abs. 

then i got on a yoga mat and realized how hard it is to actually hold up my own body weight in plank. and i kept on coming onto the mat and found that  seconds became , then , then  (still difficult lol) minute. 

i started to notice older people do yoga and how unconcerned they were with the way they looked‚Ä¶ they just wanted to feel good.

so now, when i set my own fitness goals, i think about longevity and sustainability:

‚ú®i want to be able to do things like tie my shoes, breathe in downward dog, and stand on my tippy toes when i'm hanging out with my future grandchildren

‚ú®i want my joints to be free of pain so we can walk around the parks, beaches, etc. together

so i keep these in mind in my own movement practices whether yoga or weight training, because time goes by fast and i will be at that age sooner than i know. 

my body will look however it is going to look, but can i keep up with a lil grand baby crawling up and down the stairs?

this is why i prioritize

mobility,
flexibility,
smooth,
& easy movements.

‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I get this a lot since I used to do a lot of weight lifting, endurance sports, and intense exercise before making yoga my preferred exercise activity. I also had this worry when I realized I wouldn't be lifting weights at the gym while i went off for my yoga teacher training in India for a month. I was more excited to do yoga and leaving in a few weeks so i tucked that thought away to deal with later.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I came home after a whole month of no "intense" exercise. Instead i had a whole month of daily yoga and walking. I got comments that I've gotten leaner, i look stronger. I felt more limber and strong-- in the way I could hold up my own body weight for long periods of time with an even, smooth breath.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
I felt more at peace with my body, too. One thing about a regular yoga practice is that it breaks my ego down and reminds me of what is most important. What self love really feels like. I wanted to prioritize my functionality and my ability to bend and move freely. I LOVE me some intensity, so I'll still play around with HIIIT and calisthenic workouts, kettlebell circuits, even get a day pass at the gym to throw around some weights. But you can bet that most days, I'm just doing yoga. Not just because it can build/maintain muscle and strength if I want it to, but because it makes me FEEL good. and when you feel good... you have this glow that automatically makes you LOOK good. No matter what size, what muscle mass %, no matter what weight.
.
A year later and i look at myself in the mirror and surprisingly, my body's kinda the same size. I have little less muscle definition, but i'm okay with that. What has changed is that I can look at myself without wanting to change anything. And I'm okay with whatever shape my body takes.

i went to Rishikesh after i graduated in  as a little gift to myself and loved it so much i went for advanced training at the same school  months after.  i didn't (and still don't) mean to become a teacher right away- i just wanted to learn about yoga a little bit deeper than i've been exposed to. i still have a lot of learning to do, but what i've learned has been slowly transforming me. 

i was just thinking about this time after a friend and i (that i met all the way across the world at my YTT) caught up and shared laughs and good bites. she and her boyfriend were in the room next to me, were both from california, vegan, and were both going into medical school afterwards. now we hang out in each other's living rooms and she talks about her real baby and i talk about my fur baby.

connections and events like that prove to me that life is more than random coincidences‚Ä¶

and if it ends up being coincidences at the end of it- at least i enjoyed it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø üíï

the school i went to was @rishikeshvinyasayogaschool, you can check out more info on their page. i made some youtube videos about it a while. back:

.
.
but recently, i've stopped leaning toward what my body looks like as a gauge of love. i still love my body, but not for what i can see as much as for what i feel. i ask myself this:
.
.
what can my body do?
.
.
it can finally hold *decent* handstands (i've been practicing for months)! my core is strong enough to hold me up, even when things get flipped upside down. .
.
it can endure a brutal but amazing training session @tonehouse each week (and gets better each time, i thinkkkk)! these classes aren't daunting anymore. they're therapeutic and empowering! .
.
it can fill out clothes for a woman and not a child. it can stand for longer than five minutes without seeing stars and triggering faint spells. it can send a hunger signal to my brain without fear of rejection. .
.
it can give to and receive others. hugs, laughs, smiles. it can see it's own reflection in a mirror and feel...acceptance. .
.
my eating disorder started as a pursuit for a tiny waist and a flat stomach. you know what?
.
.
it nearly took my life.
.
.
i was so obsessed with what my body looked like and not what it could do. when i was extremely underweight my body couldn't do anything. it could barely breathe and walk without discomfort. .
.
well, i've finally given up on such a shallow goal. when i shifted my mindset to focusing on what my body could do in good health, i fell in love with the abilities it granted me...
.
.
and they're sure as hell not worth cashing in for a body that lacks the strength, heart, passion, and LIFE that come with the body i have today.
.
.
if this is the body that brings me the greatest peace internally, then i accept it as it is. healing is a process, always in flux, but when you hit the milestones like this one...you realize it's worth every second ‚ô•Ô∏è

i thought that to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, i had to work out vigorously every single day with absolutely no rest. 

i thought that if i didn't break a sweat then a work out didn't ‚Äúcount‚Äù. 

i thought that being the girl who ‚Äúloves fitness‚Äù and is ‚Äúalways in the gym‚Äù was the highest possible praise i could receive, and i strived for it with a relentless hunger.

i thought and i thought and i thought but i never took time to stop thinking and just listen to my body. i let my obsession with exercise snowball. i was infatuated with the idea that exercise could be used to burn off food i had eaten or to earn food i wanted to eat. i saw movement as a means to make myself smaller, which i wrongly believed meant healthier.

 years later, here's what i know.

i know that to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, by my personal definition, i need to approach exercise from a place of love and grace. this means skipping workouts when i don't feel up to them, and resting deeply and often.

i know that low impact workouts and simple movement like walking all contribute to my health in a meaningful way.

i know that being the girl who loves her body for what it can do and not for what it looks like is the person i want to be every single day, because this girl is the happiest in all areas of life.

movement should be fun. it should be a celebration of life and strength. your healthiest self will not see exercise as a means to an end (punishment or a smaller body), but instead as a part of a happy life, not the entire life itself.

i promise if you're stuck in a hard place with exercise right now, that it gets better. please take care of yourself. rest when you need it. move how you want to, not how you feel pressured to. 

i hope this reaches anyone who needs the reminder xx

BUT i am not healthy % so my relationship with any kind of exercise varies a lot and it sucks. Yesterday, for example, i was in a lazy mood and didn't want to do yoga but still, i went with the intention to do my normal class of  minutes 

 and I did  minutes before i stopped myself and said: I don't want to.¬† Learning to stop myself from doing exercise just because i want to burn calories was very hard and still is. A few days ago i read a post on ig that said that one should not exercise at all during recovery until you have form a healthy relationship with it and THAT is a hard pill to swallow and it is taking me time to come to terms with it so i tried to find a middle-ground, and while it is not the best option at all and i do not condone anyone to follow my footsteps, i only do yoga when i want to for the time my body wants to‚Ä¶most of the time.¬† I think this topic of exercise is one that constantly slaps me in the face whenever i feel like my journey of recovery is done, that i am fine mentally and health wise. I am not but i will, and i know so because i want to be, so, i will continue to work with my relationship with yoga because is pretty neat and i really want it to be a plus on my life, not a form of punishment for my healthy habits that my ed voice deems bad.¬† Exercise is not about burning calories, i know that much :)

But I carry on, just rather wearily, like ploughing through treacle. I did the parkrun this morning while H had the babies and took the car to get a new tyre. The tyre took longer than expected but he did eventually manage to meet me after the parkrun and we went for a coffee in the same outdoor cafe as yesterday. Parkrun was a slow one. I knew I didn't have the energy to push myself so I just took it steady but even so my legs were running on empty. I think I am probably exerting more calories than I'm taking in, even though I'm stubbornly pushing myself to eat three meals a day and mostly succeeding. I think I should eat more but my rigid brain doesn't want to bend that way. This afternoon we have hung out at home, taking it in turns to entertain the babies and do jobs. I managed a nice period of one-handed jigsaw doing (I was bouncing baby  in the bouncy chair with the other hand) outside in the warm weather, so that was good. A little bit of (almost) me-time. H and I also took it in turns to each have a short nap on the sofa. Now it's the evening. We might get a Chinese takeaway later but H and the girls are out, and I am home with two sleeping babies, so I'm waiting for the others to get back. I'm sitting with the remaining mess of the day around me, and ignoring it while I drink a glass of white wine and try and catch up with the babies' daily diaries. I'm supposed to write in them every day but I'm pretty rubbish at remembering and always end up writing a few days at a time. I really hate to admit it, but I think two babies for three weeks may be my limit.

So I've been out of running for about  weeks now, and I'm only just starting to get back into it slowly. Don't get me wrong, it sucks not being able to do the things you love, buttttt. In the past I used to get so frustrated with an injury just because I feel the *need* to exercise.

For context, I basically came off with an injury after my k run in December last year. And tendonitis is definitely not something that heals overnight annoyingly. But this has been the first time (in my life!!) when I've truly surrendered and just given my body the time it needs to rest. And most importantly, I haven't felt at all bad about it at üëèüèª all üëèüèª

Does anyone have it? Answer: We have to wear masks whenever we're out of our rooms and groups are capped at  people. Every new admit has to be tested before arriving and we all got tested last week. We aren't allowed to have visitors.

Then we came home and got warm while eating scones d had brought home from work yesterday, with some of her homemade lemon curd.  We had beans on toast for tea and then we played Camel Up. I'm still cross stitching two Christmas cards for my parents and my sister so later on I worked on those a bit while we watched Sports Personality of the Year. Boris had better not change the Christmas rules again and put us all in tier . We really really want to get to see our family and we're being as responsible as we can about it.

We do have measures for restaurants though; you have to reserve ahead of time to come in, then leave your number and name once you arrive so you can be contacted in case there's an outbreak at the the time you were there. It's also meant to ensure that you can trace back where an outbreak came from, and immediately contact people ahead of time to self quarantine. Answer: Germany continued- we never had a full lockdown either. We immediately enforced social distancing, non essential stores closed, and meeting people was limited to two people outside, and only households were allowed to be in the house together. Now we can have meetings of groups, more than two households can meet at someone's house, non essential stores have opened, and are numbers are due to sporadic outbreaks in specific areas (restaurants, easter vacations, etc‚Ä¶)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-That sounds very well organised and under control.

Answer: I think most people in the UK are ok with wearing them. There certainly has not been much controversy. I think (choosing my words carefully) there has been a much broader range of opinion on masks in the US, some of which seems incomprehensible to us in the UK. In our family, we have been wearing them when out and about in enclosed spaces. Even though their main aim is to protect others, they also give a sense of protection to ourselves and I think that increases people's decision to wear them.

Answer: The school year in England runs from the start of September to mid July. So they've got another week and a half of holiday.UK schools have been mostly closed since March, only open for a few specific groups. The government says all UK schools will reopen in person in September and all children will be expected to attend. There's a rumour that pubs may have to close again in their place to keep the infection level down with the increased socialising that will come from schools opening. We will see what happens.

Also most of the new covid cases come from a specific part of Poland (rn everybody is tested there to prevent more spreading)  and everywhere else the situation is pretty much under control. Also we were one of the first countries to introduce the full lockdown. I'm not sure what will come out of all this in the future but let's not freak out.

Doc ID: 14643, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Wait, you have to wait  weeks? Why did I think it was ....? Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.

Baby's mum phoned in sick to the contact centre, but no one thought to ask her what her symptoms were. Contact centres could be hotbeds for viral spread, given the number of people going in and out of a small number of rooms all day every day. Plus there is VERY minimal (ie none) cleaning and sterilisation of toys etc going on between each contact session. I have fired off some emails enquiring about protocols. Schools are all still open but d's school has sent a letter saying that if they have to partially close due to teachers self-isolating or being off sick, certain year groups will be prioritised to continue going into school while other year groups will be told to stay at home.

It never occurred to me that after having the vaccine I could do any other things‚Ä¶ I don't know if that's just me being dumb.  Probably it's partly me because I know I'm quite black and white about things, and I just follow the rules, vaccine or no vaccine. So as and when UK lockdown relaxes, I'll go with that. Maybe it's partly that I'm lucky that I'm quite happy with my lockdown life and so I'm not looking for any ways out. d wants to come home from uni next weekend for d's birthday, and I really don't agree but it seems she's coming anyway.

We stayed in a lovely Airbnb apartment on the middle two floors of a classic tall Georgian house that had private parking and was within walking distance of the city centre (two of our main criteria!). We were supposed to be having  days holiday in Spain this month, but that obviously isn't going to happen so a mini-break to Bath and later this month a week in Cornwall are our replacement holidays. For my non-UK followers, the UK government has an Eat Out to Help Out scheme running in August, where they will pay half the price of food and soft drinks at participating restaurants. It makes eating out much cheaper, especially when you're a family of five - we can save ¬£ per meal.  Anyway, Bath was lovely. We walked all around the city, sat in the park outside the Royal Crescent and dreamt about living there, walked by the river, the girls did some clothes shopping, we went up to a park on a hillside outside the city and looked down at the views, d and I went for a couple of runs along the canal towpath‚Ä¶ it was just an easy chilled out few days.

Doc ID: 16008, distribution: 1.0 ; I read a lot of posts about people worrying over catching coronavirus and how to prevent it. Guys, most of us are going to catch it no matter what we do. At least % at a conservative estimate. The social distancing, self isolating etc is not to stop us catching it but just to delay it, slow the rate of new cases and flatten 'the peak' so that our various health services can cope with the numbers of seriously ill cases needing hospital care at any one point in time. For most of us who are under  and healthy, we are going to catch it, recover and then likely be immune and be able to get out there and be useful as we will no longer transmit it.  Keep washing your hands and following the advice given, but understand that none of it will guarantee to prevent you catching coronavirus sooner or later. Plus if you don't catch it this year, you'll probably get it next winter when its likely to come back.

But then I think what they did for care homes and hospital visitors etc and I fear they can.In Scotland students are not allowed to visit home, say for the weekend, because that classes as two households mixing indoors, which is not allowed.

Doc ID: 16351, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: When do you need to get your first cervical screening? Does it hurt? Answer: In the UK, it's at age . You should get a letter from your doctor inviting you to go. If you have never been sexually active, you are unlikely to need screening so check that out with your doctor before you go. This is because cervical cancer and the pre-cancerous changes that screening aims to pick up are connected with the Human Papilloma Virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. In the UK, teenage girls are routinely vaccinated against this now but you should still attend screening when you're invited. Teenage boys can pay to get the HPV vaccine privately currently, but I think they too may soon get it routinely on the NHS.No it doesn't hurt. It can just be a bit uncomfortable, but it's over really quickly. The more you can relax, the more comfortable it is - but of course that's easier said than done. I was able to chat to the nurse all the while she was doing it. I even commented that maybe I should have shaved my legs, and she made a pshaw kind of noise, like leg-shaving was so irrelevant in the world of cervical screening that she couldn't care less what state they were in. My appointment was at .am and I was walking out of the doctors surgery by .am so that's how quick it was.

Our family of five could order food and non-alcoholic drinks and instead of it costing us ¬£ it would only be ¬£. It was brilliant for us, we ate out all over the place loads more than we usually would. It was really popular, restaurants got booked out days and weeks in advance. There were downsides - some restaurants got overwhelmed and some people were rude, and now there's a feeling amongst some people that maybe it helped spread the virus.

Answer: Yes I definitely follow the news in the US and have been seeing the riots. We have had protests in the UK today, but they don't tend to escalate into rioting and looting. I think in the UK the public's relationship with the police is different to the US. In fact so much is different due to our countries' different histories and our different constitutions and day to day life experiences, that it is hard for us to fully understand each other's positions. Some issues are relatable across the culture divide though.

(Those of us who aren't key workers and therefore aren't going out to work, that is) It's kind of become second nature to the point that I even catch myself feeling anxious when I read in a book or see on TV two people going into each other's houses or meeting for a coffee. So it's strange when I read posts on tumblr of people in other countries who don't seem to have these restrictions yet. Like, they can still call round to someone's house?

Even people who've had two doses here, we aren't allowed to be hugging each other or going inside someone else's house or even into their garden. We can't leave our local area (vaguely thought to be  miles from ones own house).Maybe when the lockdown ends and the country opens up again it will feel different.

I'm not entirely sure I agree we should be, but since we are, we are getting the jab. Because now services will expect us to be willing to facilitate contact etc etc and there will be conflict if we declined the vaccine and then don't want to take risks. Personally I think teachers, police, supermarket workers, anyone who comes into contact with many many members of the public each day should be more of a priority.  But anyway, H had his vaccine, so now he can go back to sitting in his work-from-home office seeing no one all day every day.

I don't think we have the Moderna one yet but it's on its way.It's a bit of a mind boggle to me how they will make sure everyone can get the second dose of the vaccine they had the first dose of, and how much vaccine to allocate to second doses while they're still rolling out first doses.

How can afford all those trips? For some reason I always thought you were pretty well off... hope this doesn't seem judgy, that's not my intent at all!!  Take care!  Answer: I personally don't know any family who could suddenly pay out an extra ¬£ a month and not bat an eyelid about it. It takes some adjustment to get used to, some switching round of the budget, adjusting expectations and spending decisions. If anons think that the majority of families out there wouldn't be affected by that, I think they're sadly mistaken and maybe not having realistic expectations of what adult, meals out etc are all factored into the family budget. A sudden additional regular outgoing is not factored in and so rearrangements have to be made, but they can't happen on the spot. I can't cancel a holiday that's already paid for, and I can't get a refund on a meal we had last month. We afford vacations because we are careful with our money and we budget and we are privileged to have enough income that with doing these two things, we can do a lot of the things we would like to do, and we are grateful for that.

Now this was the first time eating out and travelling on trains to London in a veryyyyyyy very long time. Strange, yes. Very. In restaurants you don't have to wear a mask but it is mandatory on public transport. The social distancing rules also change like the wind, but you can meet up with others from outside your household in small groups (of up to  people I am pretty sure ü§®). And these rules apply to places not in local lockdown.

It's a bit crazy right now and I still feel extra cautious about sanitising all the time (rip dry hands), not going too near other people I'm not meeting, and checking my temperature when there's a monitor thing (these devices are pretty cool, no pun intendedüå°)!!! Having said that, my  days in London were enough for me for now.

Doc ID: 14636, distribution: 1.0 ; Because I got my vaccine kind of secretly (they gave volunteers at the vaccine hub the leftover doses at the end of the day to save throwing them away), we're not allowed to tell anyone we've had it.  Which is no big deal except all my healthcare worker friends are getting theirs and plastering the fact all over Facebook and every time I read another post like that, I feel irritated that I can't say Yay Me too!  Ultimately it doesn't make any difference and I'm so grateful to have unexpectedly been given the vaccine, I'd just like to be able to process the emotion of it with other people. Instead my fellow volunteer friend and I just message each other back and forth going I can't believe I got it! How sore is your arm? How are you feeling? Doesn't it suck we can't tell anyone!

Doc ID: 14464, distribution: 0.15157230247602807 ; Question: I live in a suburban area in the States. We eat takeout   or  times a week. We can walk our neighborhood, however anywhere else on foot or bike is dangerous due to speeding and distance. People where I live still fly Trump flags, which I find disturbing. My parents are Trump supporters and my neighbor was at the Capitol riot. I deplore Trump and can't understand why people support him. Answer: My personal experience on the walking is largely driven by a stay in a suburban area outside New York, where the children's playground was  minutes walk away from the house but there were no pavements and when we walked anyway we got a lot of funny looks (and it didn't feel very safe). Then when we got there and said we'd walked, everyone else looked at us like we said we'd flown.I think takeout in the US is maybe different to takeout in the UK. Only based on the different ways we use it. In our family and the families around us, we might have takeout a couple of times a month as a treat. Our takeout is usually either curry, Chinese, pizza or fish & chips. They're pretty calorie dense and nutritionally poor in terms of vegetables etc and eating that  times a week would not be healthy plus it would be very expensive. I get the impression in the US that it's a) cheaper and b) a more regular way of feeding oneself?

Or is the study still going on and you shouldn't get vaccinated? Answer: If we get invited for a vaccine and are planning to accept it, the study will unblind us and tell us whether we have had the covid vaccine or the control. But then we're out of the study. So they'll only do it as and when - my neighbour who's a nurse and in the trial just got called for a vaccine and she unblinded and found that she'd already had the vaccine.

Big shoutout to @veganmutti for her crazy shopping trolley organisation, and @notjustclothing for sending me one of their face masks ‚úåüèª
-
Ok so in all honesty, something that was once a very normal activity felt incredibly strange. Mum and I was also very surprised that very few people were wearing masks!? In the UK it hasn't been mandatory to wear them in shops. Wearing a mask on public transport by is essential. However ... literally the next day it was announced that from the th of July, face coverings will be compulsory. Personally, I feel safer wearing a mask to protect those around me, and myself. Not sure if you feel the same? ü§î
-
Also as I said, this mask was from @notjustclothing and they a running a campaign where % of the profits go to @masksfornhsheros! It is very comfortable, not itchy at all, reusable and comes in  colours (if looking good in a face mask is a priority for you üòâ). More importantly though, they are made from Diolen, which is very hygienic and allows you to breathe (and talk!) normally. They're also made here in the UK, so I highly highly recommend if you need/want a mask.

I feel like the news I see in the US don't really depict the lockdown. Answer: Hmm well for me it means I basically don't leave the house except for exercise, or once or twice a week to volunteer in the vaccine hub. It's work from home for H and school from home for the girls. Nobody else is allowed in the house or garden and we're not allowed to stay away overnight. I can meet up with one other person at a time outside in a public place to exercise, such as go for a walk together. We have to stay local for exercise, although there's no set rule on what is local, which means everyone interprets it differently (including the police who can and do impose fines if they consider you're not staying local). Non-essential shops are closed, but we can still shop online. We get our supermarket delivery once a week and so we generally don't have a need to go in any other shops anyway. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are closed although they are allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services so some have found ways to stay open.

No quarantine has been brought in as yet and hopefully she will be back (Friday) before the next quarantine rule change comes into effect (Saturday) so even if Portugal is added to the list, she will be home. Ironic that the number of cases in the UK now exceeds the level at which we set the quarantine for other countries. . Schools in my area have been open for four days and already five schools have entire year groups learning from home and self-isolating because of Covid positive cases.  . I was discharged from my appointment at the breast clinic this morning because my lump has gone away and they think it was all hormone related.  .

Doc ID: 15191, distribution: 0.30514144121687425 ; Question: How is the pandemic still impacting the UK? I am so frustrated in the US with how things are. Answer: Ah it's all going a bit wrong again in the UK. Numbers of positive cases are on the rise again. The government has tried to spin it as being due to the increased numbers of tests that are being done in Covid hotspots, but that excuse is wearing a bit thin and unconvincing now. Schools have just gone back and several have had to send entire year groups home to self isolate or even close again after pupils and teachers tested positive. Universities are about to start over the next few weeks, which will cause another lot of mixing of people and quite likely cause a spike in cases. So, we sit and wait to see how bad it will be. Everything is pretty much reopened now, but things may have to start closing again in order for us to be able to keep schools open and case numbers down. For now we can meet  people or two households outside or just two households inside, but summer is coming to an end and autumn starts to get a bit chilly for meeting outside unless you are being active and walking etc Local lockdowns are in place in various areas where no meeting up indoors is allowed. I think we are headed for more of those. Just watching how even in New Zealand where they managed to have no cases at all for so long but then had a resurgence, I think it shows just how hard to control this virus is.

 now here's a TW for sexual abuse/trauma reactions
 it's scary how something that happened so long ago still affects me right now. most of the time i don't even think about it, but it also seems to be all over me, does that make sense? my severe jumpiness is known to everyone, i've legitimately fallen to the ground and half under a table at work once - because one of my coworkers suddenly entered the room quite fast and it startled me. me falling or jumping away or flinching is a super regular occurence at this point. only a few trusted people are allowed to touch me, otherwise i get uncomfortable as hell, leading up to feeling paralyzed and in shock with a following panic attack in the worst case. sudden noises or people (especially men) shouting/following me/running towards me scare the shit out of me. i can't stand anyone being behind me really and i can't sit with my back towards doors/open space without going mad, i always look out for escape routes instinctively. it's a part of me at this point, yes my poor girlfriend ‚Ä¶ despite being careful and understanding and all, sometimes a single move can send me straight into a flashback, meaning i curl up into a ball and completely lose touch with reality while sometimes shaking or crying, reliving it in my head or just disassociating. in this state i absolutely cannot be touched, else i just move away from whoever touches me in blind panic and it gets worse. last time a blanket was put around my shoulders, i apparently got off from the bed head first and curled up at the wall, looking like a bunny in panic. it's not technically my fault and i am aware of that, but i feel so very bad about it still. i keep reassuring her that it is not her fault when i snap, and i'm working on communicating more clearly what i need/when i am not okay with something. she keeps telling me it's okay and i don't have to apologize, but i still feel so sorry. she's not the one who hurt me, it's not fair how she has to put up with it anyway now, kind of? because i know i'm not the only one who is struggling, i know it's hard for people to understand and rationalize it has nothing to do with them personally when i snap and panic. somebody who once accidentally triggered this response in me said ‚Äúi'll never forget this look in your eyes, you were so scared ‚Ä¶ of me!‚Äù. it's weird. yes i was scared, but not really scared of you. just. scared?

It came through as Breaking News, and we followed it live on the TV on Wednesday evening. It was truly shocking and scary. Our girls were watching it with us and commented that it was like The Hunger Games. There's lots about the US and the ‚ÄúAmerican mindset‚Äù that we don't comprehend - Donald Trump, the handling of the pandemic, reluctance to wear masks, the way everything comes back to rights in the constitution, gun laws, cars etc etc. It's such a different frame of reference that it feels like we outside the US can't even debate it with you because the starting point isn't even on the same page. I fully appreciate not all Americans think the same, but to answer your questions of what we think of you as a country, we generally think the US is pretty crazy and we're glad we don't live there. We do watch in horror though because the US is such a big player on the world stage that its decisions make a big impact.

technically it was just his test that came out positive while mine read negative but given the % accuracy of a positive test and a % chance of a false negative AND we spent every day for the last  months together, i'm gonna say ‚Äúwe‚Äù both tested positive

we both came out asymptomatic, took necessary precautions to isolate, and are feeling fine now, but my point is‚Ä¶ even the most careful people are exposed. we're lucky because we're young, healthy, and i guess aren't predisposed to being hit hard by the virus but many are not as fortunate

we got tested because it was free in our area, and i thought it would be useful to know if we were carrying even if we didn't have symptoms

the pandemic isn't over. in fact, california's numbers have not really improved since lockdown started and aren't being helped by the businesses and social areas are opening up

Compared to the UK maybe? If you don't feel like thinking/writing about it, just ignore this question haha, it's purely out of curiosity! Answer: I find it very interesting but I just have more questions and no answers. I'm really curious for example as to why Germany has such a low mortality rate compared to the UK when I believe our healthcare systems are pretty similar. Is it an actual physical reality or is it to do with different representations of the numbers/ proportions of testing etc. I'm interested to watch Sweden and see their numbers given that they held firm against a lockdown at the point where the UK changed strategy. (Although I think we'd have had an even bigger disaster in the UK if we hadn't imposed a lockdown - and why hasn't that happened in Sweden?)Are there different mutations of the virus that have reached different countries, causing some to have higher mortality rates than others?How do genetics and population demographics impact on the death rate? Given that it's quite clear that having a higher BMI is a big independent risk factor for a poor outcome, how does that impact on the HAES movement? Why does smoking seem to be a protective factor and is this why some countries with higher proportions of smokers have lower mortality rates? What is really going on in many countries around the world whose data is suspect? And so on and so on.

Doc ID: 14931, distribution: 0.0848047433497674 ; Question: just curious how other countries work.. Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news. We probably hear more about US news than we hear about many other countries, but I'm sure there's loads of US news that never makes its way onto the world headlines.On the BBC and ITV, which are our two main TV channels, there's always a news programme at pm. This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a / news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don't understand the American people a lot of the time. I know the election coverage has probably shown the worst of some groups but even outside that, in general we/they seem to have a different approach to life. Having said that, I'm sure the UK is horrifying to watch at times to others too.

Doc ID: 15934, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Obviously in the U.K. we are isolating at home but when looking at Sweden and South Korea, it's potentially not the solution to self-isolate? I'm not saying it's right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn't change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I'm not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don't know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don't know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren't yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said ‚ÄúThe only thing worse than no test is a bad test‚Äù. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren't reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let's see what today's press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14936, distribution: 0.1901693803377281 ; Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start‚Ä¶.So first we had lockdown , where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was ‚ÄúStay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives‚ÄùThen that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was ‚ÄúHands, Face, Space‚Äù ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had ‚ÄúEat Out to Help Out‚Äù, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system - with varying rules on what we could and couldn't do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown .. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It's not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can't meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it's the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There's a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don't follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined ¬£, for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan.

Doc ID: 15951, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you still believe quarantining the population is not effective because eventually everyone will catch it anyways? And earlier you said if no one catches it we are not building herd immunity? Is this true?  Answer: Hmm I think that's a bit of a twist on what I said. This is the situation as I understand it.Quarantining the population is effective because it *delays* the transmission, flattening the peak of the cases and decreasing the chance of the health services becoming overwhelmed. In the UK, we are all socially distancing and keeping  metres away from anyone not in our household. All non-essential businesses are closed. This will remain in place until the ‚Äúsurge‚Äù is over and the numbers of cases stabilise and fall to a manageable level for the health service. Then it's probable that some elements of the social distancing will be relaxed, and what is likely to happen then is that as we start to mingle again, the case numbers will gradually rise again. Then there'll be another clamp down and social distancing measures put back in place. This relax and tighten process will potentially be repeated several times over a period of months. Many of us will catch it during this time, but for lots of us we will have only very mild or no symptoms and may not even realise we've had it. If they bring in antigen testing, we will be able to test to know for sure who has had it.It's all theoretical at the moment because no one knows for sure how the virus behaves. We don't know yet if we will be immune to it once we've had it once, so it's hard to know whether we will as a population develop herd immunity but I think that's kind of the idea once most of us have had it.

Doc ID: 14955, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you think people ever lie about having symptoms to get tested in the UK? I know some people in the US who are regularly getting tested even without symptoms and find it interesting how things are in the UK. I don't personally know people regularly getting tested but have heard of people doing it. Aren't you part of a trial? Answer: Oh yes I know some people have lied about it. However if you test positive, by law you have to self isolate for  days along with your household, and I think this puts some people off getting tested. I think more people lie the other way - not getting tested when they have symptoms, than lie to get a test. Yes I'm part of a trial so I actually do get tested every week. They've all been negative so far, but I have worried about what if one came back positive (while asyptomatic) and the effect that would have on people around me and places I've been (track and trace would be after them) and the things I wouldn't be able to do. Not so much now as we are about to go into another lockdown, but over the summer we had some holidays booked and a random positive test would have meant we had to cancel.I can see the benefit for the greater good of the population for regular testing, but why would an individual without symptoms get regular tests‚Ä¶ I don't get that so much. I just find it stressful!

Doc ID: 16017, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I dont live in the UK so I dont know all the details, but from what I've seen it sounds like boris Johnson is not handling the coronavirus appropriately. Why aren't they shutting down and taking appropriate steps? It seems like he has made very insensitive comments about how some people will die and that he just doesnt care about the vulnerable population. I'm curious your thoughts Answer: Boris Johnson and his scientific advisors have made their recommendations on the basis of scientific predictions. I do understand the logic - we need around % of people to catch corona (and survive) so that we have herd immunity because this virus is likely to be a seasonal thing now. Also we need to flatten the peak of cases occurring now so that the healthcare system can cope. Plus people can only cope physically and emotionally with self isolating for finite lengths of time and may start disobeying it right at the critical time if we start too early. If we close the schools, grandparents may end up looking after the children thereby putting a vulnerable age group at more risk of catching it. Their model says schools would need to be closed for - weeks for it to be effective at preventing virus spread, which would clearly have a massive effect on the country.It's true though that people will die. I think Boris said that so we all appreciate the severity of the situation and the importance of doing our bit - handwashing, self isolating etc. Unfortunately it did come across as a bit uncaring and when we look at what the rest of the world is doing, it's hard to keep faith in the UK government that their policies are enough when many other governments clearly think differently.Partly also the UK is somewhat behind mainland Europe in the course of the pandemic. We still have relatively low numbers of covid . So their advice may change over the next few days and weeks as the situation changes.I'm following the BBC live news feed quite obsessively to keep up with the world situation.

And my friend. People I trust. I think it's more just don't broadcast it all over social media. I figure here doesn't count because it's anonymous. Actually I think maybe it's not quite such a big deal now because there's been quite a lot on the UK news today about how none of the vaccine must be thrown away and it should all go into the arms of people, so there'd be more understanding now of how we came to receive it. But probably not all the volunteers all over the country will get a chance to receive it, just because of different clinic circumstances, so I don't want anyone to think it's unfair.Do you mean different phases in the vaccine roll out? Yes there is, right now we are in phase one, which is over-s and frontline health care and social care workers. I think some of the clinically vulnerable as well? I'm not sure.

There were adverts out earlier in the year looking to recruit volunteers, that's how I found out about it, and I thought I could do my bit to try and help save the world - we don't get many chances to make a big difference like that. There's some thousands of people involved in it, in multiple countries. I've had a vaccine (and a second vaccine dose) which could be the COVID one or it could be a meningitis one (which they used as a control). I have to go back every few months for blood tests, and I have to do a COVID swab every week for the duration of the trial, which I think is a year. That's about it.

The government is emphasising (as cases rise) that just because we are allowed doesn't mean we should.  We have decided in discussion with my parents and my sister, that we will travel up and visit them for the five days. I don't think they have worried over it half as much as I have. I wish they would express a bit more concern although they have had lower cases than we have so I think maybe it doesn't seem such an immediate worry. Anyway, we are going to isolate from Friday (tomorrow in fact) so we should have four clear days before we travel. Then we'll travel without stopping on the way. That's the best we can do. Once there we will just be in our bubble and won't go anywhere or see anyone else. H and I are practically self isolating anyway, we are very diligent at following the rules. The girls have been in school but today was their last day so all that contact stops from now. Of course that is all dependant on Boris not changing the rules over the next week which I would not be surprised if he did if cases keep on rising. Holding everything lightly. But we will all be gutted if we can't go.

Doc ID: 14533, distribution: 1.0 ; I've been volunteering at the vaccine hub again this afternoon. It was crazy busy because we were doing two days worth of vaccines in one day. We got told last week a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was arriving on Tuesday and then later that a batch of Pfizer was arriving on Wednesday. The Pfizer has to be used in three days, so we had to do ALL the AstraZeneca today.  doses. We had to open a waiting room for the waiting room, because even with the best will in the world,  vaccinators cannot get ahead with those numbers. Every time one vaccinator table paused to draw up more vaccines, or to give a little extra time to someone who needed it, the queue built up.  I did a  hour shift and walked  steps. ‚ÄúNext please! Hi there‚Ä¶. come through‚Ä¶. follow me‚Ä¶. just take a seat right here‚Äù *big smile behind mask so that it spreads to my eyes and they can see it* Return to the door. Repeat. I think I might be doing it in my sleep. I'm back there again on Friday. I think today it was the + age group as well as healthcare workers. We are moving on to people not in the top four priority groups for the next few days, I think. Tomorrow I was meant be meeting a friend in the morning for a walk and another friend in the afternoon, but because our car is stuck on our road in the snow and likewise for my friend and her car, I've had to cancel the morning friend. I can't say I'm too sad. A rest will be nice.

Doc ID: 15241, distribution: 0.03570783793593088 ; Hello tumblr This week I'm coming to you from Cornwall (for my non-UK followers, this is the very south west part of England). It was supposed to be Menorca, but eh‚Ä¶ Covid disrupts the best laid plans. We left our home at am yesterday morning for the  hour drive. To Americans, I believe that's a standard day trip, but to us Brits that classes as ‚Äúa very long car journey‚Äù. The traffic is notoriously bad on the route, causing long delays, hence the early start. Alarms went off at .am, we got up, packed the car and away we went. The girls promptly all fell back asleep, and H and I took turns to drive. At .am we stopped for brunch in a fab farmhouse-type restaurant (scrambled eggs on toast for me and full English for the other four), and by am we were in St Austell, dazedly walking round Tesco buying food for the next few days. d insisted on buying a giant watermelon. It's nice to be able to shop for holiday food without it being a huge eating disorder trauma, which it has been for me on so many family holidays. The only foods I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù us to buy were eggs and yoghurt, everything else I went with the flow of the communal decision making. I didn't even buy salad leaves, I looked at them and felt grateful that I don't even need to spin off down a spiral of feeling the obsession to have them. Shopping is so much easier without an eating disorder shouting in my head! After much hilarity trying to fit four full shopping bags into our already full car (you probably had to be there, but we just stood there by the car with the giant watermelon in our arms wondering where it could go - eventually we strapped it into the seating part of the baby's pram), we headed on to the Eden project (pictured above). We were really a bit too tired to enjoy it properly but it filled the afternoon until we could get into our holiday cottage nearby. Then we safely arrived at our cottage, unpacked, and the evening passed in a haze of snoozing on the sofas and then bedtime. Food today:  scrambled eggs on toast, porridge oats bar, half a tub of chilli bean soup, many slices of french baguette with spread (I was really hungry and ate and ate the bread),  chunky ginger biscuits,  pieces of chunky hazelnut dark chocolate. I think I underate today but my hunger cues were all confused from the early start and then being too tired later in the day to feel hungry or care.

Yes it may be quiet out there - but that's because the rest of us are following the spirit of the guidelines. If we all did what you're doing, it wouldn't be quiet! I know someone in the government said that it was ok to drive for exercise as long as the drive was shorter than the walk - but if you can exercise from your front door instead then DO SO. If you do not *need* to get in your car, then don't. Don't put yourself on the road, at risk of a car breakdown, a sprained ankle on that beautiful distant hill you're climbing up, or any other mishap that might require other people putting themselves at risk to come to your assistance. The exercise allowance is to help us stay physically and mentally healthy. It's not an excuse to go traipsing around the countryside to see some beautiful scenery. We are in lockdown because this is a global pandemic and many many people are dying. Let's get our priorities straight. No wonder the government won't tell us about the strategy to exit lockdown. We can't even cope with a very simple two word instruction ‚ÄúStay Home‚Äù.

Then I volunteered to help out with the mass testing in d's school, which would have come to something if all the schools hadn't then been ‚Äúshut‚Äù (I know they're far from being shut). Then a friend mentioned she was helping out marshalling at her church which has become a vaccine hub, and I said to let me know if they need more volunteers‚Ä¶ and so finally tomorrow morning I can go and play a part in the vaccination effort. I'm excited to have a ‚Äújob‚Äù to get up and go to (.am though? Haven't been up that early for a long time). I hope I can help ease the way for everyone coming for their vaccines in whatever role I get allocated to, and be a tiny part of getting the UK out of this pandemic.

Before this, I had one of the early kindles, before they had touchscreens, but it's battery eventually gave up. I like this one because it has a backlit screen, and the touchscreen is useful sometimes. However I liked clicking button on the original kindle to turn the page rather than touching the screen on the new one, I keep turning the page the wrong way or turning it unintentionally.But on the whole I love kindles and the way you can buy a book and be reading it almost immediately. Plus you can go on a holiday and take several books with you all in one little kindle (although I do always take a paperback as well because you never know when your kindle battery is going to misbehave).

desperate to get out the words that lay at the center of your soul
in a world that demands your silence
I want you to yell at the top of your lungs
letting loose the storm that swirls inside of you
you were not meant to deny the pull of lifelifelife pulsing through your veins
you were not meant to exist on a steady diet of ‚ÄúI'm sorry‚Äù
apologizing for the very air you breathe
you were meant to stand proudly
walking as though you command the room
speaking as though your words drip diamonds

we need you
we need your voice, your mind, your raging, passionate heart

Doc ID: 7383, distribution: 1.0 ; i've gone through a lot of changes in the past  years. while many aspects of my life are in flux, one factor always remains constant: my love for reading. i fell in love with reading as a child. as a young teen, when my eating disorder took over my life and everything was darkness, i turned to books as a source of light. each novel was a quivering flame in a sea of suffering. i discovered that words gave me hope. the stories i read took me out of my own life, the one where i was in constant pain, and brought me somewhere beyond. to this day, falling in love with a beautifully written story is one of the greatest feelings in the world.
.
.
the past few weeks have been marked by unpredictability, by fear, by instability. i've turned to books during this time to once again bring me somewhere beyond. to help me cope. and quite frankly, to keep me busy. pictured above is my quarantine stack, aka the books i've read between march th (when i left school) and today. for my thoughts on each one, you can check out the 'reads' highlight on my profile. each one was fantastic. the nightingale and untamed are my favorites from this stack! . .
.
some details about my personal reading habits: yes, i buy my books new during this time. i'm eager to read, and ordering online is the way i'm choosing to nurture this practice right now. expensive? a bit, but this is an investment in myself. i pass my books along to friends and family when i'm done, so i know they'll be used and well-loved beyond my initial purchase. i also prefer tangible books over e-books as this allows me to find time off-screen and give my eyes a rest (i spend *plenty* of time online, so im all for reducing screen time)! i make sure to always have a highlighter with my when i read to note passages that simply took my breath away. i go back and read these later. they fill me up. words heal.
.

i spend hours reading. sometimes i spend whole days reading. this is the number one way i'm practicing self-care during the chaos of the current moment. i could not encourage this practice more. drop suggestions below for my next round of reads please! ü•∞

from the dark days of destruction.

with each influx of breath.
a moment of silence please,

grave battle
that night when I prayed to the universe almighty
that the rise and fall of that chest would end
when I swallowed those pills
and closed my eyes to the world
oh,

pain-soaked, world-weary heart,

My friends, the time has come for book challenge numero dos!!! You should know the drill by now, comment down below your top book recommendations and I'll be ordering myself a new set of reading materials to start off the year. Oh and a little blurb would be even better if you want to really tempt me üòÜ
-
As you guys know, I've found myself reading, and actually enjoying it, quite late on in life we could say. I was a total bookworm at primary school, but fell out of it in my teenage years proclaiming that ‚ÄúI didn't have the time‚Äù or ‚ÄúI couldn't stay focused‚Äù. Now the former may be somewhat true, because I just didn't have it as a priority back then and I truly believe that everyone has time for what they *want* and *choose* to do. And let's face it, we all have different priorities. But last year, I introduced it back into my life and have been totally hooked on the books since lockdown one-point-o (hehe and we're here now in lockdown three-point-o but I shall quickly digress) üôÉ
-
And as for being distracted, I was literally like Holly stop kidding yourself and stop making false assumptions. Just pick up the book and read it üôÑüòÇ

Anyway, so here you are with total freedom again. I'm definitely going to be leaning towards more adult fiction this time, but feel free to give me as many recommendations as you wish ü§ó

Doc ID: 7283, distribution: 1.0 ; it's no secret that i read‚Ä¶a lot. if i didn't grow up an athlete i'd definitely say reading is my favorite sport. these past few months of stillness have been a blessing for my reading practice. i'm growing as both a reader and a writer! that being said, i wanted to share some of my book recs based on the type of reader you consider yourself to be in the current moment.

if you're just getting started: A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman is a great jumping off point if you haven't hit the pages in some time. it's relatively short with an easy-to-follow plotline. this is a very feel-good story! the author writes with simplicity yet so illustriously. 
**honorable mention: Turtles All the Way Down by John Green

if you need a thrilling plot: The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. you won't put this down. it's twisted and intriguing, with a remarkable plot twist at the end. this story follows two different character perspectives, so it requires more attention than a single-character plotline, but there isn't too much complexity to the craft here, which makes it less intimidating to read!
**honorable mention: The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah

if you're craft-crazy: All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. if you read and write often, the craft here will leave you breathless. there are so many intricate details that weave together in this piece that will bring you to a standstill. i read this months ago, and can still recite lines that left me speechless.
**honorable mention: City of Thieves and The th Hour both by David Benioff

if you're up for a challenge: The Secret History by Donna Tartt. this read is around  pages, but don't let it intimidate you. tartt is sophisticated and captivating, with characters development being a strong feature. this book calls for a highly attentive reader; there are plenty of subtle details that you may miss if you're not helplessly immersed in the story (which, i promise, you will be). i wish i could read both of her novels again for the first time. 
**honorable mention: The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt

Doc ID: 2903, distribution: 1.0 ; If you can't tell, I'm sitting by the pool - which was where I spent almost every day while writing this book, because I really wanted my readers to FEEL what my characters were feeling. I would jump in the pool and take everything in: how my skin was bitten by ice as I first touched the water, to how my hair would sway softly with the waves and so on. The same goes with all of the scenes I wrote. For example, if my main character was running through a forest, I too would go for a walk through the closest forest and take in all the senses: sound, smell, touch, taste and sight. So I really hope that when Pembrim comes out, you can truly feel like you're inside this adventure and their world. On another note!

Doc ID: 15064, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you find it useful when anons call you out on stuff? Have you ever read something and realised they were right? Or does it just feel like an attack? Just wondering - I think some people try to call you out to help and some just to make themselves feel better, but was just wondering if it had ever been something constructive for you?? Answer: Sometimes there's something useful in there or some niggle of truth in what they say when they're calling me out, so yes it can be constructive in that way. Sometimes I can see why they're saying what they're saying. Often I feel that they don't fully understand the aspect of my life they're commenting on, which is understandable because I can only convey so much in a text post on tumblr. Then I catch myself and think that when I was deep in my eating disorder, I dismissed everything that everyone was saying - that's classic eating disorder behaviour. So then I check myself and look for the truth in what's being said.Some anons just seem out to make themselves feel better by firing off a rant, and even when that feels it's sent as an attack, I don't tend to take it personally. I appreciate it probably touched a nerve in them for them to decide to send me a message.I can only think of once or twice when anons have been really malicious and basically just trolls out to cause mischief with their messages. I don't publish those ones, I just hit that delete button.

Sometimes I choose to write more and sometimes I don't.If you send me a question on anon, there is no need to be scared of the reply because nobody will know it came from you. You can even use it as an exercise in developing resilience. I don't mean that patronisingly because I have done it myself and become much more able to deal with anon negativity you message me about something and feel that I am jumping down your throat in response because you accidentally wrote the wrong thing or I took it in a different way to what you meant, you can message me again with a clarification and we can resolve it.You can message me off-anon and I will reply with the respect that someone who is brave enough to make themselves known deserves. In the meantime, anyone who hides behind a grey face to message me, has to accept that they will get the answer they get.

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12127, distribution: 1.0 ; I WROTE A NEW SONG (in case you were wondering) Co-written with incredible Carrie Welling.  This is not how I wanted to share it - I wanted to drive to Nashville and get a quality recording. But it doesn't look like that's in the cards in the near future, so you're getting it early. I was told many years ago (half-jokingly) that, in the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda, I would ‚Äúwrite my way out‚Äù of my struggles. I couldn't stop creating, even then. So I am writing my way out. This song is about battling my body, and is written for every one of my humans who has sat beside me in treatment centers and therapy groups and crying in hallways. I hope it resonates. (Yes, it's recorded in a car and with a sad, probably out-of-tune ukulele because we make do with what we have.)

Doc ID: 9110, distribution: 1.0 ; a little under a year ago, I was in this same place in this SAME outfit.

I had a whole life reflection written out but I decided to keep it short. a lot has changed since then. but also not that much. i'm still figuring things out and learning the ins and outs of me. i'm not fixed on an end goal as much anymore because there are so many things i'm pursuing that to ‚Äúwait‚Äù for each thing to happen would be pure torture.  the magic of the song not at the end of it, but is subtly weaved into the melodies, harmonies, beats, bars, verses, and bridges. I want to sing along.

Doc ID: 12134, distribution: 1.0 ; I am so (so) very excited to share with you the song I've been working on! It's one of the first songs I've written that really sounds like my own voice. I could never listen to songs about hope when I was at rock bottom. They felt bright and glittery and cheap. So I wrote a song that I could actually relate to, and I hope you find some resonance in there too. I've never quite been convinced by rainbows and sunshine words, so here's to what some friends have lovingly termed, ‚Äútenacious goddamn hope,‚Äù the kind that meets you in the trenches. Here it is: My Kind of Hope, co-written and sung with Carrie Welling.
