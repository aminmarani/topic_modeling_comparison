I am hoping some of you may receive your @narnastore orders today, so please do send us your pictures if you do for SHOUTOUTS 🍌😆
There may be extra videos this week so stay tuned on YouTube, the first of which will be about how I memorise a tonne of information for exams 📚 Do you want it today or tomorrow? 
Yesterday I basically filmed a uni haul when I was doing some packing, so that will be coming soon too 🎓
Speaking of uni, this is my last week at home 😢
And finally . . . I've had to say hello to UCAS again 😬 uh oh . . . 
Anyway, I hope you guys are all happy smiling 😆 Tell me what you've been up to this week down below 👇🏻

Hey guys!!! So the next what I eat in a day video will probably be a longer one on YouTube, explaining how and why I've changed my diet over the past few months, but here's another reel in the meantime ✨
-
: I always eat something first thing in the morning so today I had a couple of these clementines. This was filmed on an active recovery day so I wasn't running, but I still eat just as much as when I am working out! Rest is equally important 🙌🏻
-
: My official breakfast was a purple 'Smoatie Bowl' as you guys helped me name (smoothie x oat bowl). It's SO good my friends: creamy, peanut buttery and ah chef's kiss. The recipe is down a bit on my feed 💜
-
: Lunch was a very very easy bowl of sweet potatoes, one huge and perfectly ripe avocado, salad and sesame seeds.
-
: I always have something sweet after my lunch, so I had more fruit and I'm still trying to perfect this chocolate mug cake recipe 😉 A bit later on I then had some vegan chocolate buttons 🍫
-
: Dinner was again another very easy meal. Brown rice that I meal prep, baked beans (I just eat them cold they're so good to me haha), veggies and pickles - essential ✌🏻
-
: And my final meal of the day was another oat bowl with a pear, frozen blueberries, cacao nibs and soy milk 🌙

Remember to listen to your body and eat what you want ok my friends! @myvegan discount code is HOLLY as usual 🌿 Big love ☺️

It seems like you're very attached to staying in the hospital and keeping track of how many days you've been there? Are you proud that you've been there that long? It seems like it.  Answer: I'm sorry that it seems like I don't want to get better. That is not my intention. I do want to get better but I'm not sure how or if I can. I honestly feel pretty hopeless. I've been doing the work and trying all of these different treatments but none of them seem to be working. I would love to be anywhere else right now and I am not attached to staying here. I am not proud that I have been here this long and it honestly bums me out when I think about it. I keep track of the days so that they come up in chronological order when I go back to look at them. I use the daily posts as a journal because I have memory issues due to severe mental illness, side effects from electroconvulsive therapy, and traumatic brain injuries.

.
.
when i finally reintroduced movement, i had no idea how to do so with grace. i would wake up at  AM to put in a two hour circuit, forcing myself through reps on an empty stomach, wishing i was anywhere but here.
.
.
then i would shower, climb back into bed, and wake around noon for a second workout in this same gym. a long distance run. i hated every second.
.
.
i haven't worked out down here since. today, in the midst of the quarantine chaos, i laced up my sneakers and headed down the stairs. i tied my hair in a ponytail and stared at myself in the mirror. i swore for myself i'd bring happiness and light to this once-toxic space. to this forgotten war zone, where i waged battle against myself every day, twice a day, for years.
.
.
i didn't follow a guide or a streamed workout. i simply turned up my music and had FUN. i lifted things and put them down. i jumped around. i stopped to dance. i took  minutes to be in my own company and to move with love, for myself, an expression of gratitude for all the growth i've undergone.
.
.
today i healed. today i loved. this epidemic, this chaos, this quarantine. it's devastating and flipping all of our lives upside down. but for me, today, it was a small blessing in disguise. it forced me to confront the lingering corners of a dark past, and flash a light into them.
.

Please don't let anything stop you from wearing the outfit you wanna wear & living your life the way you truly want to!! 💪

I haven't posted one of these reels for a while!! So I thought it was time to come back with a friendly reminder 🌻

When you eat food, it doesn't just disappear, it has to settle in your tummy & go through the process of digesting & absorbing all the nutrients from the food first… So it's no wonder you'll experience some bloating in your abdominal area after eating!! Plus, it's normal to have fat on your belly. Please don't be so hard on yourself!!

Do I regret all the yummy food, social drinks with friends, the laughs, the dancing, the deep conversations & being fully present while I'm out at dinner… all because it means I have a bloated belly throughout the night? Of course not. I'd much prefer that then one day look back at all the years I'd turned down invitations or been miserable while I was out. I owe nobody a super toned, firm, flat tummy. People are too busy enjoying their lives to even care about what I look like. What you look like is the least interesting thing about you. Life is so much fuller when you allow yourself to have a full tummy & heart 😍

I also saw @lilyturtoncoaching post a vid like this recently & it hit home. Check her vid out too for a double reminder that you're not alone 🤝

.
it's been an enemy of mine for some time now. you would think working full time with a  hour round trip commute every day would make hitting the pillow extremely easy. i wish! even if i'm terribly exhausted, falling and staying asleep are struggles for me. im constantly looking for new ways to enhance my abilities to fall asleep as well as the quality of my sleep. 
so when i came across an article that my friends over at @thethirty put together on a sleep trick, i was intriguing. and desperate. .
have you heard of the // trick? i hadn't until i read about it. the article explains it best, but essentially this is a breathing trick that forces your heart rate down. doing so allows your body to prepare for sleep. you take  seconds to inhale a deep, deep breath. then you hold that breath for  slow seconds. finally you release the breath slowly, using  full counts. the first time i tried this, on around  or  seconds of the exhale, i literally felt my muscles loosen. the fist i was unaware i was holding under my pillow actually released itself. i felt like i melted into my sheets. .
and hours later...i woke up.
i had fallen asleep within minutes. and i didn't wake up countless times during the night. i realize this sounds absurd. magical even. .
but simply forcing my body to prepare for rest was all i needed to do to cross the bridge into sleep. i'll be completely honest and say this works  times out of . there are still nights where i'm restless and lose plenty of sleep. but i wanted to share this trick with you all because it has helped me immensely! .
i also find a five minute deep stretch before bed to help me get into a state that's prepared for sleep. on days where i cant tackle my racing mind i rub lavender oil on my chest and wrists and have found success with that as well!
.
what are your bedtime tips and tricks for falling asleep? i'd love to hear them! .

i have been a little less active here the past couple months, and a big part of that is because i've been busy. busy figuring out what i want to do career-wise. busy working. busy feeling lost. busy coping with hard emotions. busy resting. busy living.

that being said, i miss telling you what's happening in my life and want to share with you the big life moves happening over the next couple months!!

- i am leaving my current employer at the end of this week.
- i am packing up my apartment.
- i am starting a new job (virtually for the first couple months).
- i am spending as much time with close friends and family as i can.
- and possibly the most exciting change…i am going to be moving in with blake in philadelphia and living in a new city for the first time in my life!

change feels hard and scary, but staying stuck in a situation that doesn't feel right anymore is harder and scarier.

i don't really know how these next steps will look or feel for me, and that feels pretty nerve-wracking and terrifying. but, i'm also excited to be moving onto a new chapter in my life soon!

for those of you making changes in your life and doing hard things, i see you, i'm with you, and i'm proud of you! 🤍

Doc ID: 2432, distribution: 0.6005454141257073 ; This caption is about to get kinda morbid, but stay with me here...

Imagine you're on your deathbed. You're  years old (💪🏼), you look down at your hands, they're wrinkly and frail, your skin is paper thin, you're unable to move your body like you used to, you need physical support from your loved ones just to do the normal everyday things you've always done (make food, shower, clean & poop). Now ask yourself:
-Do I *really* regret eating cake on my birthdays?
-Do I regret never going to the beach because I was ashamed of the dimples on my legs?
-What do I wish I started doing sooner?
-What things did I take for granted that I wish I could've appreciated more at the time?

I can almost guarantee you wouldn't regret eating cake with loved ones, but you would probably regret avoiding the beach and letting your insecurities restrict you from living your life the way you want to. Maybe you'd wish you appreciated your young and healthy body more, or played a sport without the fear of people “judging your lack of fitness” or had the confidence to ask that person out on a date, no matter what it is that you wished you did differently, I have some GOOD NEWS... You're not on your deathbed. You're capable of doing anything you put your mind to! You're in the perfect position to start LIVING and stop hiding. And if you're not happy with your current lifestyle or mindset around your body image, YOU are the only person in control of making those positive changes for yourself. 

You're a wonderful person with a wonderful heart who deserves to live a fulfilling, happy life that isn't controlled by restrictive diets or the distorted view you have towards yourself. I just hope this will inspire you to see that. Please stop putting your life on hold until you look a certain way. Please stop punishing yourself for what you did or ate over the weekend as every Monday comes around. Please live for the now & be kinder to yourself 💛

Happy Real Me Monday! Have the most wonderful week ya big cutie butts (with cute lil leg dimples) !!! 🫶

These are some of the classic self-sabotage thoughts I had up until this year. At the beginning of  I started asking myself, “Will it matter when I'm older?” and it really helped me to stop overanalysing the small stuff and missing out on things that would bring me JOY.

When you're , will you really be wishing you never ate that block of chocolate? Or will you be more upset that you turned down a night with your friends because you were on a diet? 

Life will pass us by... So wear that bikini to the beach, upload that photo, go on that date, start your journey to health, spend a whole day watching movies, take a risk, skip leg day if you're not feeling up to it... Life is precious & can be challenging enough without the extra pressure we constantly put on ourselves. 

Please, do yourself a favour, next time you stop yourself from doing something you'd find enjoyment from, ask yourself “When I'm older, will it matter?” 👵🏼

⁣
six months ago, i discharged from residential treatment for the last time⁣
and i remember packing my snacks that day and vowing to make that my last discharge date. i realized that discharging does not end the work i was doing, the work had just begun.⁣
⁣
and i celebrate this because it represents a huge mindset shift for me and i never thought i would make it this long out of treatment, but here I am. before my oct  discharge, i discharged from residential treatment in July and had to be readmitted to a high level of care two weeks later. making it this long is something I would not trade for the world, and i could not be any more proud of myself.⁣
⁣
this shows i can do anything i set my mind to. i am so grateful for this chance to live life and grateful to everyone who helped me get there. like for real i am so grateful to be alive.⁣

I don't want to be another voice shaming them for struggles. I want them to know I'm not going anywhere.  Shame doesn't shift maladaptive ways of coping; compassion, though? It changes a freakin' lot.

i'm claire, and i'm depressed. a lot of you probably know that i've struggled with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders because i've typically always been pretty open about my mental health journey and recovery on this platform. but lately, i haven't talked about what i'm going through as much on here, and that's because sharing that i'm struggling with my mental well-being in ways i thought i was over is hard.

especially as someone who's always preached self-worth, self-love, self-kindness, and self-acceptance, it's hard to admit that a lot of days, i feel like a worthless mess. it's hard to admit that i haven't been keeping myself accountable with meds/doctor appointments. it's hard to admit that eating has been my primary coping mechanism the past few months. it's hard to admit that sometimes, i let my mind beat myself up.

but, here's the thing. healing isn't a one and done type of thing. our lives aren't stagnant. new challenges, new situations, and new circumstances are all things that might bring up old feelings or coping mechanisms, and that's okay. struggling with your mental health isn't something to be ashamed of, and being vulnerable about it is a strength, not a weakness. i read something that said that this time you're not starting over from scratch- you're starting over from experience, and i felt that.

to anyone who feels like they're stuck in their journey, starting over with their healing, struggling with their mental health, or fighting a battle that other people don't know about or just don't understand, i see you, i'm with you, and i support you.

Sandwiches are one of the simplest and most basic foods, yet we all know and love them.  Even in the world of loaded up toast, smoothies with  ingredients, and extravagant breakfast bowls, sitting down and eating a good sandwich is still one of life's simplest and greatest pleasures.  It can be so easy for me to get caught up in always trying to be “better” and have more accomplishments because it sometimes seems like everyone around me is doing extraordinary things.  I forget to stop to appreciate the simple things about myself that make me who I am. One of my current goals is to be more like a sandwich and embrace the things about myself that I might view as too plain or simple because often times it's the ordinary and simple things about you that make you so extraordinary.  Stop focusing on what you aren't, and start embracing what you are because you are already enough ❤️ // sandwich #deats ➡️  slices of toasted @traderjoes flax seed bread with half a sliced apple, melty provolone cheese, a chicken,kale, & brie patty, and a chopped stalk of celery

Doc ID: 2517, distribution: 0.45910776420123034 ; Same workout, but different results… This is what changed 👇

I grew up fearing food, restricting it — then inadvertently overindulging, not understanding how the food I ate affected my body & constantly feeling guilty after eating. So I just wanted to leave this here in case you're feeling the same way. This is the difference your food intake can make…

On the left, I was working out at the gym BUT I wasn't giving my body enough fuel to build or even maintain my muscle mass, I felt weaker & hungrier.

On the right, I'm still resistance training the same amount of days per week BUT eating more, feeling stronger, I have more energy & give my body sufficient energy to build / maintain my muscle mass.

Without eating enough, your body can barely carry out its basic functions; breathing, brain function, pumping blood, digestion, etc… Let alone give you the energy to exercise, socialise, focus, laugh & enjoy life… Which are all things your body has the energy to do when you give it enough food to THRIVE on.

This isn't about one body type being better than the other, it's about the lifestyle FEELING better — having more food flexibility, not ignoring hunger cues, feeling stronger, enjoying life more. This is here to show you the difference fuelling your body properly can make 🥲

It isn't the enemy, it's ENERGY. 

It also goes to show that copying someone else's routine doesn't mean you'll have the same results as them! So many different factors are at play:

🍝 diet - the type of food you eat + the amount of food you eat
🧬 genetic makeup - some bodies are naturally leaner, some build muscle mass easier, some have longer torsos, wider hips, etc
🕺🏼 exercise - the intensity, frequency & type of exercise you do
💤 sleep / stress / etc — this varies for all of us. Even if we ate & exercised the same, we'd all look different. 

Moral of the story is… Your body can't run on an empty tank. Instead of focusing on how your body & life looks, think about how it FEELS 💗

 // First of all, wow. I actually managed to achieve it. pm ish. And for  days. Round of applause ladies and gentlemen. To me, pm sounded SO so early, especially considering that I'd been going to bed consistently at midnight before I tried doing this.
-
 // Once I got into it, it was a lot easier than I thought. Routines are powerful, and once you find that routine, everything becomes significantly easier. I'd have to be showering at pm, eating soon after and brushing my teeth at  minutes to the hour.
-
 // Getting up at am was EASY! So easy in fact. When I did my first am challenge I was going to be at pm ish, so getting enough quality sleep made a huge difference. Whilst it did also take my body a couple of days to realise that we were shutting off so early for the day, I eventually found my inner sleeping beauty.
-
 // Meal prep really helped, and eating dinner outside was super peaceful. But haha stop right there: the UK summer is still pretty cold and breezy. Not ideal.
-
 // The not so good. I kind of felt as if my day was shorter? Even though it wasn't, technically . . . It just felt that way 🤔
-
Anyway, so going forwards. Will I keep my new pm bedtime? Well, the answer is probably no. I think somewhere between  and :pm would be ideal, but haha lol that hasn't really worked so far oops 🌚

 Prepare yourself to: 
 • LOSE YOUR SEX DRIVE! - wow can you believe that one day you might not even wanna have sex? You're going to be OUT of it all the time. Making out with someone is just not a big thing. The next big thing isn't an orgasm but hitting your goal weight. 
 • BE COLD ALL THE TIME! - even if you haven't experienced large drops of body fat or weight. When your body produces too little thyroid hormone, it can make you feel cold no matter the temperature. Also, you might notice strange little hairs everywhere. Thats called LANUGO - your body is trying to keep you warm. 
 • BRUISE EASILY! - Its enough just to pinch your thigh and congrats, your legs are officially purple. Caused by low blood sugar and lack of vitamin B in your system. 
 • BE THIRSTY EVEN THO YOU JUST DRANK! - aw man, it must be so fun to constantly shock your body like this. You can go through  bottles of water and still have dry mouth. Unexplained but could be a sign of diabetes. Drink liquid magnesium, it makes a huge difference! (cal) 
 • STANDING UP AND PASSING OUT! - you get used to it but its always a nice shocker. I'm pretty sure we all look insane when we stand up and then grab the nearest thing to hold onto. This is called orthostatic hypotension and occurs when a person's blood pressure falls when suddenly standing up from a lying or sitting down position. 
 • HAVING BAD MEMORY! - mixing up words and their meanings, forgetting small things like dates and years. Do you really need a medical name for this or do you realize its caused by not feeding your brain the proper foods? 
 ANOREXIA IS NOT PRETTY. IT IS NOT A FASHION TREND! 
BE PRO-RECOVERY. GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

——
STOP shrinking yourself into some arbitrary box when you are meant to be so much more 📦
STOP caring so much about what other people think because you're never going to be everybody's cup of tea 🍵
STOP living a life that is small when you could be living a life that is big and vibrant 🌈
STOP comparing yourself to others and past versions of you 🙅🏻‍♀️
STOP worrying about the future when right now are the good old days 💭
STOP getting in your own way because life is short and precious, and you deserve to be living your life to its fullest🌟
——
today is a day filled with opportunity to keep moving forward, so even if it feels hard, i urge you to open yourself up, notice the world around you, feel things deeply, have courage, let go, and TRUST that there is more for you 🤍

Going back to Cambridge the other weekend was so amazing as I got to see a lot of the dance fam, although it did feel slightly strange being in the city bubble and not feeling stressed?! Even though I loved my time there, I've come to realise that all good things do come to an end and you sometimes have to move on in life. If I did get accepted to do Graduate Medicine, as I applied for last year, I genuinely think I would have burnt out. Rejection has meant that I've truly reconsidered my options, and as you guys probably know, I am really excited about the possibility of studying for a master's abroad 🌎📚

Therefore after my time out, student life will most certainly continue. The student discount card will also hopefully still come into use 😏 Who knows how long I'll have a @wearetotum card for, but regardless, I'm a huge fan of what TOTUM does for students and have done since  👏🏻 Thank you for making my student life just a tad bit cheaper, and the cards can now even get you access into clubs (… or let you buy paracetamol) instead of using your standard driving license or passport as proof of ID!

Doc ID: 2496, distribution: 0.6632500656427768 ; Happy Real Me Monday! A few years ago, every Monday marked the beginning of a new endeavour to have my “dream body”… But I just wanted to remind you:

🌟 Just because it's Monday doesn't mean you need to start a new fad diet or punish yourself for what you ate or did over the weekend.

🌟 It's not a dream body if it's a nightmare to maintain!! 

🌟 AND the “dream bodies” you see online & compare yourself to probably don't always look like that anyway (take these photos as an example!!)

My dream body now is whichever body I'm in when I'm living my happiest, most balanced life!! 

Giving up diet culture & accepting your body does not mean you're “letting” yourself or your health go. I believe it's actually one of the healthiest things you can do! All bodies — at any size — can engage in health-promoting behaviours that can improve health: reducing stress, joyful movement, intuitive eating, balanced nutrition, therapy/communication, sleeping more, prioritising your inner peace & so on.

Here's a quote I read recently that made me feel all warm & fuzzy towards my own body and reminded me WHY I choose to make healthy choices out of love for my body instead of hate.

You are not too “fat” or too “skinny”.
You are not too “old” or too “wrinkly”.
Your nose isn't too big & your 🍑 isn't too small.
This body has carried you around your whole life.
It's picked you up when you've fallen down.
Fought through colds and flus, broken bones and broken hearts.
Even when you put it down, it just keeps going.
Keeps on working to the best it can.
Through the good & bad, your heart continues to beat.
It'll take you through to the very end.
What a beautiful, clever thing.
And what a beautiful, brilliant person you are.
- by Makaia Carr

You will bloom if you take the time to water yourself 💛

 i'm kind of terrified, kind of unstable, but it's not even about food. it's like, hey, i'm working on getting better, trying hard and i have for so many years now. what the fuck is going on? my whole past seems so surreal. are my parents … really my parents? they seem just like strangers, on the other hand it still makes me feel strongly to interact with them - just different feelings every time. sometimes i get panic attacks, sometimes i turn into a full on zombie and won't show any expressions or talk, sometimes i get so angry and it is far from any normal kind of rage that i have ever felt, sometimes i feel fragile and very sad, and sometimes, rarely, i even feel hopeful and i am okay with seeing my mother the group homes, psych wards, moving out when i was , it really did something to me. sure, i was one of the lucky ones, getting out in time and ending up in a therapy group home, being offered many opportunities and getting chances. unfortunately though, these places always come with tons of triggers and unstable people, and a group home can never really be family-like, it does not even come close. these different groups, new caregivers, people moving in and out constantly, people freaking out frequently  also, the  emergency/short-term group homes i went through before, all while i was still , some things have happened there that i still fail to understand. back then, i somehow survived it, clinging to my writing, food restriction and some sort of numb acceptance. but … it probably cannot end well to keep up to  young girls, ages -, in a house like that. no phones, no money, not allowed to go outside - to protect those who were there anonymously. nobody there who wasn't taken from home for a reason, nobody who wasn't in some way traumatized or had mental issues, and if you didn't look out for yourself, nobody did. this place … it turned many of the older ones into monsters. selfish and aggressive and angry, leaving out their frustration and fear on each other, but also on those who just went numb and quiet. i suffered, writing being my saviour, but most of the time these memories are repressed. when i read my writing from back then now, it makes me shiver. nothing was safe, people even stole used underwear, and you never had space for yourself, we did not even have a garden, and it was not uncommon to have new roommates every day. it was like being imprisoned, but to protect us, i guess. people coming and leaving every day, nothing unusual. yet i would always have chosen to stay, if my other option had been to go back to my parents, yes, if i had been given a choice afterwards, the therapy based group home i was referred to, mainly because of the suicide attempts (all while i was still ) and selfharm … oh, in comparison, a dream. i had sworn to myself i would do anything within my power to never be forced into a psych ward again, i worked on my issues and actually managed to avoid that step - there were relapses with selfharm, especially hitting myself was something that flared up over and over again, i had started it in the emergency group home, being out of opportunities, and i also still had these suicidal thoughts, terrible mood swings, increasingly often panic attacks, depressive episodes, boundary issues and of course my food problems, but despite some very bad moments, i always was able to avoid being taken to the psych ward. breakdowns still come frequently to this day, including everything, but i am able to handle it a lot better, reaching out before it is too late, riding out the waves, keeping everything in a safe way without longterm harm to my body or mind. something else i have learned is to … not deal with everything at once. sometimes i'm tired and i don't want to take a shower, you know? i still do, although on my bad days i sit in the shower, but that's fine - i still do take the shower. which i know is not possible for everyone, sure, nobody feel offended or bad please, it's just not one of my biggest struggles. i do things bit by bit if possible, to avoid being too overwhelmed. usually, it's pretty good no idea what my point is in writing this? well, everything that happened in my life, it feels very far away and surreal at this point. i suppose i will never be able to fully let it go - for example how very jumpy i am, it is something everyone around me is aware of, because it cannot be hidden, my reaction comes instantly and is out of my control. will it ever go away? or is the way my father treated me forever going to haunt me like this? who knows … i'm better than i used to be, for sure. i can cope with things better, i'm legally an adult and i do not depend on my parents, i live by myself, i managed to still finish school with a , gpa and have all the opportunities, am right now doing my dream job. hell, it could be a lot worse, right? also, how i was diagnosed and labelled - it's not what i base my worth on and i do not see it as a constant, but to this day it makes me feel strange to think that … yes, during the general diagnosis they also tested my IQ, which was done in primary school as well due to me being overly bored and hating school, both times resulting in me being declared “gifted”. well, i guess i have a good memory, i can read pretty fast and understand things easily, but do we need this label? those who know about it, like every caregiver in the group homes for example because they read all the papers, have always treated me a bit differently. it's like people have higher expectations, which sometimes may sure be justified, but in general it is so offputting. the human brain and “intelligence” are way too complex to be described by a simple number, and me, it is true that i get bored easily and often have to wait for others to understand things, but that's about it. i'm human, please just treat me as that but there is this problem, how easy it is to let go of people, how hard to let them in. how i turn on people, suddenly feeling no emotions toward them anymore. i do have friends and i am social, but it always feels like i am just pretending? pleasing people, craving closeness, but not actually feeling it and being scared of commitment? i have learned how to behave, how others behave, i know how to act in certain situations, but it does not come from my heart?  i am weird today, sorry to everyone who actually read this far. despite a lot of guilt and a need to procrastinate, i'm going to prepare and eat dinner now. my weight cannot slip further

Doc ID: 9148, distribution: 0.16533824145704334 ; here's a story about my love for fruit toasts:
.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
my dad used to make me breakfast every morning when i was a kid. he always had some culinary art or experiment to serve me (usually an omelet made up of leftovers-- it was like his own Chopped challenge). when i say every morning, i mean e v e r y m o r n i n g before he dropped me off at school. that is, until i was introduced to the toast + nut butter + fruit combination. as soon as my brother showed me the ropes on how to toast bread until warm and crisp, spread a smooth layer of sticky thick peanut butter on the bread and then top it with banana slices, i could NOT get enough. sorry dad... but at least you were able to rest a little bit more in the morning .
i used to think i was super fancy but then food photography came to instagram and the gastronomic versions of toast or breakfast emerged. despite that, i'm not hard to please. somehow my level of fancy is pretty much most people's low end. but fancy isn't really my goal. it's the combination of the warm, crisp but soft bread, with the salty savory nut butter and the almost tart, mostly sweet fruit accent on top that grounds me. it takes me back to the days i would get ready for school early enough to beat my dad to the kitchen and make us some toast so that we could enjoy this wonderful combination together.
.
(ps- i really looked up "food jags" in my nutrition text book to make sure it isn't disordered behavior because i swear i'll eat other food but this is just so good + easy to me that it's my first choice lately every day haha)

Doc ID: 9748, distribution: 0.5958075484608221 ; on social media, we have the power to choose who we follow and interact with, and that's really neat! for a long time, i felt like i needed to unfollow anyone who didn't share the exact same values and opinions as me because i was worried about feeling triggered.  now, i realize that there can be a lot of value in following a diverse array of accounts and hearing other people's perspectives whether or not they are similar to mine.  hearing someone else's different opinion doesn't mean i change mine, but it helps me learn about the complexities on certain issues, keeps me humble, and reminds me that everyone's human.

HOWEVER, there's a huge difference between someone having a different opinion from you and someone making you feel bad for having the opinion that you do. it is % okay (and expected) to disagree with someone else's opinions or for someone else to disagree with you. no one is better or worse for that. what isn't okay is making people with different perspectives feel less than because of it, and if someone you are following on social media makes you doubt your own worth, tries to instill their beliefs in you, is causing distress, or simply isn't serving you in any way, it isn't worth it, and you have the power to set the boundary you need.

as humans, we are complex, diverse, and multi-dimensional people, and our opinions, which are formed by our own individual experiences, reflect that. despite our differences, we are all doing best in this world, and that is going to look different person to person.

reminders:
. social media is what you make of it.
. choose kindness.

From personal experience, my number one piece of advice is to just stay calm!!! Trust me, it canNOT get lost inside you and relaxing your muscles will just make it so much easier. Tip number two is to squat right down, like righttt down . . . which works because of the way it tilts your vaginal canal, and again you just need to trust me on that (but please try it yourself so you're convinced) 😉

Honestly, I FEEL FAB in the photos on the left... you can clearly see that I feel confident, but guess what? I feel equally as fab in the photos on the right too! ☺️

The truth is, I NEVER would have posted the photos on the right to social media a year ago... The only version of me y'all would've seen was the version on the left, the % of me, the posed me, the version of myself that not even I see unless I'm sucking in, tensing hard & posing my body in certain ways to make the 'right' places stand out. But as some of you know, last year was my year of finding my confidence & accepting all versions of me. 

& I by no means have any issues with someone posting their best photo & feelin' themselves! I'll be there in the comment section shouting “YES QUEEN 👑 LOOK AT YOU! 🔥” but at the same time, for me I think it's super important to also post the ordinary, unposed, realistic shots as well. Why shouldn't we feel just as empowered & loving towards ourselves in our more comfortable, in-between moments? 

Anyway, those are my Real Me Monday thoughts for this week. Hope y'all remember how INCREDIBLE you are & strut straight into this week like the smokin' hot supermodel you are with an 'I can do anything' attitude 😍

Feel free to leave a lil '👑🔥' emoji in the comment section if you're going to do your best to LOVE YOSELF this week & I'll cheer you on hehe ✨

Also, I'll be posting some healthy recipes, workouts, a timeline of photos from my kg weight loss journey & more to my IG feed throughout the week so stay posted! 🤩

Much love,

One of the best things about solo travel and doing things alone is that you can choose *exactly* what you want to do, when you do it and how you do it. Finding freedom and joy in your own company is one of the most incredible things, and I want you guys to find that too!
-
Whilst I have always been quite a lone wolf we could say, it's only been recently when I've truly started to enjoy doing things simply by myself . . . and for nobody else but myself. I would have never spontaneously booked a short trip away to Scotland in the past or taken myself on a date. Having fun only seemed to stem from being with others.
-
But that is farrrr far from the truth, and this week I really want you guys to do something simply for yourself. Bake yourself your favourite cake (because it doesn't have to be your birthday!!!), go to the cinema alone or finally book those flights for a solo backpacking adventure you've been secretly planning!!

It feels like I cant even exist in the world without constantly being reminded of everything i hate about the way i look Answer: I think a TON of us secretly feel that same way… I know I do! Its that ed mindset, really really REALLY tough to get past it. To be honest i avoid making friends with any girls skinnier than me. I know having someone like that in my life would only trigger my ed and im trying to do the opposite of that. So i just avoid it all together. Maybe one day in the future i wont be triggered by a skinny girl and i can freely interact with them. But right now my mental health just wont allow it. I totally get your pain, dude. I totally get it. I feel like a huge asshole but i dont do it out of bad intentions. I do it to avoid ruining my mental health. I know im missing out on some awesome friendships buuuuut im healing rn.

Doc ID: 12638, distribution: 0.19760368536974116 ; Things i wished i knew before starting my recovery pt.
 
 (based entirely on personal experience) 
Tw! I think there are none :)
My mood was HORRIBLE, i felt horrible. It felt worse than my ed (and that's saying a lot) I was convince I wasn't going to make it. I was lying to my therapist, I was horrible and toxic to my best friend and family because of all the manipulation and harsh words i used with them, all while having my ed voice intensify by a thousand. 

I spend around two years in quase recover, doing exercises in secret, eating “clean” (god, i hate that adjective for food) counting calories, i was looking into different types of diets to do, had a lot of control with my food, etc. Various ed related activities but with the excuse of “i am recovering, I swear! I am just keeping the things that help me”

As i said in the beginning, I was very toxic because I was angry at myself, my situation, my life, etc. (plus the common edginess that comes with being in middle school and ) (and while it explains it, it doesn't excuse it) I was just a disgusting and unkind human being with the people around me that just wanted to help. I am so grateful that they stuck with me because they didn't need to go through that at all.  

I was in such a toxic cycle: eating, feeling okay, feeling horrible, telling no one because my ed voice told me not to, exercising at night, start over. I was just very convinced that i could heal in the mental place i was in and that it would work. 

BUT, as you might imagine, i made it! I am alive and past that horribleeee cycle. It was a SLOW process. Little by little i let go of it, first by fighting with my ed voice with things like: 
“but why?! “What do i gain from it?” “I don't think that is correct” “I don't feel fine doing that” “No. You are wrong” 
 And those kind of battles never stop! Now, I am continuing my recovery by informing myself with intuitive eating and how to have a good relationship with food and following AMAZING ed recovery accounts (who are very woke) that just feed me with the good kind of positivity :) 

I am sad because it took me + years to get my life back, I can't stop thinking “if only”s but i have to remind myself that every mistake and misstep I took, made the path that lead me where I am today 

So yeah, recovery feels worse than a ed at first, but it's overpowered by the sense of euphoria i feel towards life rn. And yes, you will make it through, because you are strong as heck.

So that they can protect you a bit?” “No… I don't think so. I wouldn't want them to be in the firing line.” “Because you don't think they could handle it?” “I just… I couldn't stand it. I would rather take it myself” “Yes, because you have always been the protector. And what does that say about the nature of what went on? When you can't bear anyone else to experience it…?” T looked at me meaningfully and I shuffled and fidgeted a bit.  I said that I thought lots of Christmas will be really nice, and I feel a bit guilty about enjoying the nice bits. Like how can I be there enjoying things, all the time alongside all the difficult stuff we have been talking about? T reminded me, “Remember we had all the good things about your relationship with your mum boxed up and kept safe?”  “Oh yes…. I forgot about that…. I just…. I feel like I need you to be there with me.” I know we are coming to the end of the session and I'm about to be on my own for three weeks. “Would it help if you knew you could message me if you needed to?” I nodded. T said “So, you can do that. You can message me if you need to. I can't promise I'll reply straight away but when I get chance I will.”  It really was just about the end of the session then. T turned the conversation to lighter things and I suddenly came up with a rush of things to tell her. I told her about a situation with d where I'd used something I learnt in therapy, and T said how well I was doing. Then we said our goodbyes and I wished T a Happy Christmas.

I don't know about you, but my 🧠 said “YES” straight away.

Of course I want to feel all of those things. I want to feel my best & look after my body, I only have one & it's my home 🏡 [@gymshark ad]

While there's no magic pill that will automatically give you all of those things, there IS something that you CAN control in order to feel all of these things….

✨EXERCISE✨

Not to change your body, not to punish yourself, but to nourish your body, to look after it inside & out.

THE BENEFITS: Physical activity releases feel-good chemicals in the body, it helps with mental clarity & brain health, improves your sleep, increases your energy levels, reduces the risk of disease, strengthens bones & muscles, improves your ability to do every day activities, and that's just to name a few!

We are so often sold exercise as a method to transform our bodies, but exercise shouldn't be punishment to look a certain way. 

It's an act of self love that will bring more reward internally than it ever could externally. Once I switched my approach to movement, I started to truly enjoy it & now I lead an active lifestyle with ZERO aesthetic goals. 

I challenge you to find movement that is sustainable for your lifestyle. Movement you enjoy. Whether that's walking, dancing, playing sport, pilates, lifting weights, running, cycling, stretching,  minutes per day or a couple of hours per week… Finding what works for you is key. Otherwise it won't last very long, and neither will your happiness!

I've been living a more active lifestyle for the past  years now, and while my relationship with movement has struggled along the way, I've finally realised that having a flexible, sustainable, positive relationship with exercise beats doing exercise you dread just because everyone tells you it's the “right way to exercise”. Listen to your body!!

We're not married but it's definitely on the cards in the not so far future. The thing is that he earns double what I do (k) but we pay exactly half of every outgoing each. He knows how much (how little) I earn and I just feel like although it's equal, it's unfair proportionally and I'm not sure how to broach the topic and I don't know if I should's so many different approaches, and different things work for different couples. H and I just have one joint account, all our money goes into it and all our outgoings come out of it and all the money belongs to both of us. That works great for us. But I know other couples do different things that work great for them. There's not one right answer.So yes, you should definitely definitely talk about it with your boyfriend. At some point you must have had a conversation that resulted in your current set up. But how is it going to work if one of you loses your job, or has to stop work because of illness, or you have a baby and one of you takes parental leave and isn't earning? It is totally within your right to ask your partner to have a conversation about it. What's more it's healthy and a sign of a strong relationship if you can talk about these important things and think about how you would cope with various potential events in the future. You don't have to come up with the solution in the first conversation, and it's probably best if you don't approach it with a “the current set up isn't fair” (even if you don't think it is!) But just open the conversation and start thinking about your options and make space for both of you to share how you feel about things. How have you both formed your views on money? How did each of your parents handle money? Did you have plenty of money in your childhood or was money tight? Do you have any big savings goals? How much debt do you both have, and how is it being paid off? How do you feel about credit cards? loans? a mortgage? Are you spenders or savers? Do you give to charity?Now go, talk about it!!

Doc ID: 2684, distribution: 0.4479211989436167 ; Sorry to break it to you but YOU CAN'T HATE YOUR BODY INTO A SHAPE YOU WILL LOVE... 😦

I spent most of my life abusing my body with unloving thoughts & fad diets (& I know I'm not the only one), so I feel like it's important to share some of the things that finally helped me change my mindset & lifestyle FOR GOOD! ⤵️

- you can't hate your body into a shape you will love, showing some love to the body you're in is much more effective
- exercise in ways you enjoy and because you CAN (what a blessing), not because you 'have to'!
- if your goal is weight loss, learn about calorie deficits... To lose weight you must consume less calories than you burn each day. This means you can still eat the foods you enjoy so long as you remain in a calorie deficit
- fuel your body with nutritious foods & allow yourself to enjoy a meal you crave every day. Remember, this needs to be sustainable!!! So going cold turkey & cutting out your fav foods will never work long-term. If you still enjoy a treat each day, you won't feel like you're missing out, feel guilty about it or be tempted to throw in the towel & binge
- remember that it won't happen overnight, but it WILL happen so long as you keep at it 🌟
- one 'bad' meal doesn't mean you have to have a bad day... 
- eating too little can actually slow your metabolism, stall weight loss & harm your health long-term... Please eat enough 💛
- it takes an excess of , calories ON TOP OF the calories your body burns each day for you to gain a kilo... So no, over-eating on one day won't make you gain weight! But over-eating consistently will. 
- rest is just as important for success, your body needs time to recover! It goes through a lot every day just to keep you alive 🌟
- the scales are fickle & unpredictable, the numbers will change day-to-day due to your hormones, if your muscles are inflamed, if you're dehydrated, if you've eaten a lot of sodium, etc so please don't let this determine how you feel about yourself! 

I hope this helps in some way?! Lmk if it does! No matter what your health goals are... You've got this! 🥰

I've decided this reel needs a permanent spot on my feed, so in case you missed it last time or need the reminder, here it is… 👇🏻

If you notice changes leading into your period, leave a “💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼” in the comments — bc your body is strong as heck & doing wonderful things!!!

It's easy to be harder on ourselves around that time of the month... The female body is torn apart in the media, held to an unrealistic standard & then once a month, we experience hormonal changes (AKA mood swings), bloating, cramps, skin breakouts, body swelling, increased & decreased appetite, lack of motivation + stroooong cravings. It's a healthy function of the human body but it causes ALL THE THINGS the media tells us isn't beautiful / good. So that's why it's SO important for us to remember:

️⃣ the female body is incredible!!
️⃣ be kinder to yourself when that time of the month comes around (and that's not just the week we get our period, but sometimes the symptoms can start creeping in early too, as you can see 😳)

These help me feel better around that time of the month:
✨ resting when I need to rest
✨ giving into my cravings in moderation / with a healthier alternative 
✨ spending time with someone who makes me feel at home (if you're like me, you probably get really sooky at times & need hugs haha)
✨ no picking at pimples!!!
✨ no body checking / staring in the mirror picking yourself apart! Keep it movin' sister 💃🏻 
✨ exercising, but I usually take it a lil easier than usual
✨ a morning dance jam, of course!!
✨ revisiting this video whenever you have your doubts & start wondering WHY your body / emotions are changing! 🥰

Be kind to yourself, EVERYDAY. You never know what your body is doing just to keep your body functioning & healthy! Let your body change & your weight fluctuate. You're sooooo much more than your body 💪🏼

i'm sure you know how imperative it is to your health to get adequate and quality sleep every night. BUUUUT we live in modern times and we need to be a little bit more realistic and gentle with our expectations!

Instead of making a long list of items to complete before bed time which can create unnecessary pressure and stress (the opposite of what we want), try adding one or two things before bed and slowly add on as you feel you can tolerate:

➤setting your time boundaries & commit to setting your electronics to airplane or night mode until the morning. most people use / to  hour from the "i will start getting ready" thought to actually falling asleep. find what works for you!

➤using blue light blocking glasses or applications when it gets dark to encourage the natural melatonin production. as someone who does % of work/studying from technology, this has been the most realistic for me to do instead of halting all work once the sun goes down. 

➤doing soothing activities before bed like reading, journaling, or crafting. just - minutes is enough to get you in the zone of relaxation

➤taking supplements when needed- like the Dream line from @FXchocolate with  mg melatonin and -HTP to help with relaxing into bed. each piece has g of sugar and sweetened with allulose, a natural sweetening agent that is found in jackfruit, figs, and raisins, with no bitterness or unpleasant aftertaste! i like to take it ~ hour before bed (try it % off with AMANDA) #FxChocolatePartner

➤sitting quietly and focusing on your breath for a few moments. some people like to call it meditation, but use whatever word works for you! i like to call it my "nightly grounding"

Whatever you choose to do, remember that making night routines a priority in your life is not selfish, it's self-full. you have to fill up your own cup before you fill up anyone else's ❤️

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that Mondays are renowned for being a fresh start, the day to kickstart your goals & make drastic changes… So I'm just leaving this here as a reminder that:

🌟 You can prioritise your health & still eat your fav burger
🌟 You can enjoy a weekend of eating freely with friends without punishing yourself today
🌟 You can love working out & still enjoy rest days
🌟 You can have bad body image days & still love, respect & appreciate your body
🌟 You can have cellulite, fat on your body, stretch marks while still being the fittest & healthiest you've ever been
🌟 You can have both, it's not all or nothing.

I started my health & fitness journey close to  years ago now. 
This body lifts weights  x a week 💪🏼
I eat nourishing foods 🥙
I get plenty of rest  💤
I drink plenty of water 🧉
I live a balanced lifestyle 🍩

I do this not to punish my body, but to nourish it. It makes me feel good. 

So why is it that when we picture “healthy” or “fit”, we picture the version on the left, but not the right? Why is cellulite, tummy fat, stretch marks, etc something we seek to “fix” through food, exercise & lifestyle changes? Why do we set ourselves an expectation to look a certain way & fit a very specific beauty standard when our lifestyles, our history, our genetics & our body compositions are all different? 

The truth is, “healthy” is going to look different on everyone. And yes, for most of us, that includes cellulite, rolls, lumps, bumps & marks.

That's not something that needs fixing, changing or hiding! That's just human 🌻

Doc ID: 7728, distribution: 0.6611018238493469 ; i don't remember how i began telling my story, or when. i can't recall which pieces dropped first, which corners of my heart bled out and found light beyond my chest.
.
it simply happened when i was ready.
.
eating disorders, like all  traumas, are deeply intimate. when i was sick i went to humiliating lengths to obey an illness. i was irrational, irritable, rude. for years i was embarrassed of who i once was and the struggle that shaped me. i wanted to bury my past and move on.
.
but with time comes acceptance. as i forged deeper into recovery, i found a new love for life that starkly contrasted the darkness of years past. my life grew brighter. i realized how powerful this transition was and i itched to share it. .
it felt selfish to hold this in, keep my story a secret when i could help someone find their way out. .
.
so i spoke up.
.
i knew i was ready because the heart with which i viewed my ED with underwent a shift. instead of understanding my disorder as a humiliating character flaw, i saw it for what it truly was: a tragedy out of my control and nothing more. not a choice, not my identity.
.
with acceptance i found a voice. i could easily use before/after photos to tell my story, but words are more powerful. i can use them to deeply convey  the pain and fear, the strength and resilience, every inch of the process from hurt to healed. my story is more than a physical manifestation.
.
if you have a story and want to share it:
*reach a place of stability before opening up. you may be too fragile right now. that's okay. don't rush.
*dismiss the idea that your story isn't “good enough”. that you weren't “sick enough” or didn't endure “enough”. *know that being vulnerable makes you stronger. courage isn't crafted in a place of comfort.
.
one thing i will say is that you can't let fear of judgement hold you back. there is not a rational soul out there that will blame YOU for your struggle. i used to be ashamed of my past. now? thousands of strangers know that i used to smash bowls of oatmeal on the floor to avoid eating. im not embarrassed by the pain i went through. i'm empowered by my ability to rise above it.
.
if you're ready, tell me...what's your story?

Happy Real Me Monday 😌 just leaving these here every Monday to break up your feed a lil & remind you not to let your mind bully your body 🌟

We are who we tell ourselves we are. Your inner monologue holds the power over how you view yourself. So if you tell yourself “I'm not good enough” then that's exactly how you're going to feel & view yourself — your mind will cherry-pick all of the little things you've told yourself are bad/ugly. But if you start saying, “I'm more than enough & I see that now”, you're going to give your mind a chance to see how wonderful you really are 🌈 

In the comments, use only emojis to describe your inner monologue/self talk. Here's mine: 🥰🙌🏼🤩👑☀️ 

I also managed to get Dylan, my boyfriend/photographer, in this post!! 🙈 He was mimicking my RMM photos & poses, but then we decided to add his photo anyway because it isn't just women who struggle with unrealistic standards of beauty. Abs & chiselled muscles are typically the physical traits men strive for in order to feel “manly”, fit or attractive... But the bloat is real among us all 😅👏🏻

The truth is... Dylan & I both eat well, go to the gym, get enough rest, drink enough water & do all the things that are good for a healthy mind & body. And that's all we hope for, to be healthy & happy. Getting bloated & having some fat on our bodies DOES NOT take away from that. So I hope this will encourage you to feel the same way about yours! 👑

In case you haven't told yourself today, YOU ARE WONDERFUL! I encourage everyone in the comments to leave an uplifting comment on the person who commented before you... Let's make each other's day 🦋

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

Answer: ive experienced bouts of bulimia and anorexia separetely. i developed anorexia nervosa as a  yo and then by  to  i was purely bingeing and purging and cyclicly attempting to restrict but always failing. im recovered from b&p, recovered when i was . since then ive recovered from the mindset slowly over the years, but slipped back into anorexia (not nervosa.. just clinical anorexia) when i was . im not always the best as taking care of myself even now. sometimes when im sad and really low i just wont feed myself because it makes me feel better to be empty and i get too catatonic to make food.. and i guess i could improve on that but thats about the extent of my self torture. i have a better relationship with food and my body now. i think the most important aspect of recovery is learning to reason with yourself. learning to mentally and emotionally evolve is challenging but rewarding. another important aspect is really learning your body, but in a positive light. not learning your body in the sense of “oh thats what the back of my throat feels like, thats how many cigarettes i can smoke in a day!!” but rather in the sense of “if i eat this much at this pace every day i know im going to be able to take a SHIT every morning! and if i drink this much water my skin will be clear when i wake up!!”. coming into alignment with yourself both emotionally and physically are both equally important components to recovering. my experience has been exhausting and traumatic and tedious to be perfectly frank lol but eating disorders tend to be dramatic like that

what if instead of getting told, “you won't gain weight from one day of eating”, we were told, “it's okay if you do”? how would that change the narrative? how much less guilt or worry would we feel? how many more people would that help?

just some food for thought because even though i understand the rhetoric behind “you won't gain weight from one meal/day of eating” and know that it may help some people feel better, i also know from personal experience how harmful and guilt-inducing it can be too.

as we head into this week during that weird period between christmas and new years where it feels extra hard to do anything that's not laying on the couch, here are some reminders:

- what you've eaten recently has nothing to do with what you should eat today
- a changing, fluctuating body is a functioning, hardworking, resilient, and worthy body
- no matter how you feel about your body, you can choose to treat it with care and respect
- your purpose in life is not to keep trying to lose weight until you die
- you don't need to jump on the “new year, new me” bandwagon
- fresh starts are not reserved for january st
- it's okay if all you've felt like you've done this year is survive

Looking back at my body from the start of last year (on the left) I now no longer see myself in a negative light, but I do remember trying this bikini on and hating the way I looked at the time (cried in the change-room and put the bikini back on the rack).

It makes me sad that I was so unhappy with myself for so long — but I want to be really clear, my body confidence now doesn't stem from me losing weight... Because even when I was at my smallest, I was super critical of my body. Body confidence comes from consciously practising self-love every day and choosing to prioritise the kinder thoughts over the negative ones. These are some things that helped me:

⭐️ Nourishing your body
⭐️ Eating well
⭐️ Being active
⭐️ Having food freedom
⭐️ Dressing the way you ACTUALLY want to dress
⭐️ Being kinder to yourself
⭐️ Accepting your body & appreciating all of the amazing things it can do 
⭐️ No more comparing yourself to others
⭐️ Following IG accounts that make you feel good & unfollowing the ones that don't 
⭐️ Caring less about what other people MIGHT be thinking & focusing more on filling your own mind with happy thoughts 
⭐️ Listening to your fav music & going about your day like you're the main character in your own movie (!!!) 🎥 

It feels so dang GOOD to put on a similar bikini now & have none of those negative thoughts running through my mind... It's a real life-changer! I hope you'll start actively incorporating some of the self-appreciation & acceptance practises I've shared above! You deserve to feel happy in the one and only body you'll ever have 💛

——
a lot of times, we think eating disorders and restriction, and we think weight loss, underweight and frail bodies, amenorrhea, hair loss, etc. because that's what's most often portrayed in the media.  people who experience all of those have very valid stories, but eating disorders can also look really different from that too.
——
when i first started restricting my food  years ago, i dropped a lot of really fast. i experienced a lot of those symptoms i just listed.  but, when i weight restored, it wasn't because i had chosen recovery- it was because the restriction had developed into binge eating disorder.  i was stuck in the binge and restriction cycle for years (restricting daily and binging nightly), and at my rock bottom, i had gained double the amount of weight i had initially lost, had high blood pressure, had pre-diabetic blood sugar levels, was mentally restricting the most i ever had, yet was eating ,+ calories almost daily, and was filled with self-hatred and guilt.  the worst part? no one in my life even knew what i was doing except for me.
——
now, years filled with ups and downs later, i am ~ pounds lighter than my heaviest weight (interestingly, around the same weight as before my initial restriction), not from restricting, but as a side effect of FOOD FREEDOM and ALLOWING myself to eat whatever and whenever i want. funny how that works, right?
side note: as many of you know, i am currently on a weight gain journey, but it doesn't have to do with my past with disordered eating.
——
i don't talk much about these parts of my disorder and recovery much because honestly, i worry that i'll be discredited and that my story won't be viewed as valid because my recovery involved weight loss.  but, this is my story, and i share it to remind you that eating disorders don't have a look, you are worthy of help no matter how much you eat or weigh, and your story and journey are valid even if you feel alone.

Have you experienced this? If so, leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments. 

You're constantly:
😅 checking your body 
😅 fixing up your clothes because you don't want anyone to see your “flaws”
😅 comparing yourself to people online / in magazines
😅 searching for ways to reach your “body goals” fast
😅 punishing your body & forcing exercise
😅 telling yourself you “don't need to eat”
😅 weighing yourself frequently
😅 hiding your body behind bigger clothes 
😅 filling your mind with unkind thoughts
😅 declining invitations i.e. beach days & dinner with friends
😅 unhappy & uncomfortable in your skin

Doing the same thing everyday & expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. So why do we continue to feed our negative body image more negativity? Why do the same things that cause us to suffer & be unhappy?

I promise, it doesn't have to be like that forever. “Let me be your mirror & help you see a lil bit clearer” 🥰 here's a few things I did every day to improve my body image & mental health.

🌸 switch the negative thoughts with positive ones, whenever you recognise yourself being unkind, focus on what you DO LIKE, such as your smile; it's brought happiness to so many people. Or your legs; they've taken you everywhere you've ever needed to go. Or your lips; they've told everyone you love how special they are to you
🌸 take life less seriously. In  years, is anyone going to be thinking about what you looked like? NO. They'll be thinking about how big your heart was, about how you inspired them, about that funny joke you told. So go have fun & enjoy your time in this body!!
🌸 EAT, honour your hunger. Your body needs & deserves food for energy to function 💛
🌸 look after your body, create healthy, balanced habits that will leave you feeling good from the inside out
🌸 remember that life is far too short to spend another day at war with yourself…

I hope this inspires u to focus on being kinder to yourself. Chat with u below ✨

Two hours to a normal person could be excitement getting off work or going out with friends when it can be total, utter agony to someone with an eating disorder. Two hours until you can eat an apple. Two hours until you have to go out to eat with family. Two hours of total panic. A day to a normal person usually means nothing. Work. Hobbies. Or just a day reading a good book. To someone with an eating disorder it can be counting the hours until you get that -hour fast and listing all the things to do just so you wouldn't binge. Just don't binge, you keep telling yourself over and over again. And the day seems to last forever. Three weeks to a normal person go by just like nothing. They go by fast if there's going to be a fun beach trip with friends and it'll be even fun. They barely even think about the passing time. To someone with an eating disorder, more panic, counting the days in agony. Counting how much weight you have to, absolutely have to, lose until that trip. How much weight you can lose in a week? How about a day?  completely obsessive days. You have to reach that gw in that time so you can look good in a bikini. And when it comes, you haven't reached your gw and you cry about the three weeks you just wasted,  days lost, and even if you did reach it, you wouldn't be comfortable enough to wear that bikini anyway. So you obsess about the next  days. And so on and so on. And just like that, time has become numbers too.

Answer: I think that's exactly what I wrote in my post?? That I know it's not excessive overall but it's the out of control feeling in my brain that's awful. Maybe if you've never experienced it, you can't comprehend how horrible it is, or maybe that it's even possible for your brain to go on a rampage that you can't stop. Perhaps you think that's ridiculous, of course you can just choose not to do it. That's what's awful about it, even while a bit of your brain is telling you that, the rest of your brain is away, in the shop, buying the food, eating it as fast as it can. If I tried to explain it with science, I'd say that spend a long enough time with a restrictive eating disorder and survival pathways in your brain open up that decide you will take in enough nutrition to survive no matter what. It's instinctive. And even after you've been eating regularly and adequately for a long time, occasionally the door to those pathways gets thrown open and away your brain goes into frenzied survival mode again.What I want to try and do is build some new neural pathways to get out of that survival mode because right now I don't seem to have a way to stop it other than to hang on for the ride until it's over.

i used to think that i could live a more free life by just adjusting my food rules. instead of  calories, i'd eat  calories. when that didn't work, i moved my calorie “allowance” to  then to  then to  up until i told myself, okay claire, just eat under  calories a day. that's a ton, so you can do that right?? NOPEEE.  because even though that was maybe enough calories for me, since i still had a set of rules, and was mentally restricting, i was still struggling, still binging, and still food-focused.  as @talyngracee put it the other day, you're just moving from a smaller cage to a bigger cage. you're still in a cage, and you're still being controlled.
——
while this doesn't apply to everyone, it is normal to want to eat A LOT of food when you initially let go of restriction, and that's because your body needs to learn how to trust you again. it needs to trust that you don't want to starve it, it needs to trust that you will listen to the cues it sends you, and it needs to trust that you trust it back because like in any healthy relationship, trust is earned and a two way street.
——
i think food structure helps a lot of people with their schedule, budget, understanding what food combos fuel them best, lack of hunger cues, etc., but when working towards freedom, it's important to get real with yourself about the WHY behind your choices.  with food freedom comes LIFE freedom, and that's worth fighting for.

Doc ID: 8922, distribution: 0.44217196744050374 ; is it possible to start intuitive eating without gaining weight? let's dive into it!

Intuitive Eating is a self-care eating framework, which brings together instinct, emotion, and rational thought. 

Unlike diets, it doesn't guarantee weight loss/gain 

We all have unique set points- a preset weight baseline wired to our DNA. 

Just like we all have unique foot sizes and shapes, we all have unique waist sizes and weights. 

The first step to intuitive eating is actually to reject the Diet Mentality. this step requires that any goals of weight loss be put on the back burner or eliminated right away because the motivation to lose weight can interfere with the process. imagine you are trying to reject the diet mentality but so focused on losing weight that anything which ~isn't~ a diet doesn't seem feasible for you.

focusing on weight loss also gets in the way of finally making peace with foods that you find yourself restricting and then binging later after your efforts to never eat carbs again goes to 💩

a part of Making Peace with Food for many (including myself) is weight gain, because they are finally eating what they've restricted for so long. eventually they get over the allure and realize it doesn't feel so great to eat a whole cake all the time.

in order to GET to that step and to feel like you are finally not controlled by your "cravings," however, you HAVE to let go of wanting to lose weight.

the good news is: along the way you learn how to Respect your Hunger & Fullness, Cope w/ Emotions Without Food, and incorporate movement you truly enjoy

Many actually end up effortlessly losing weight after the gain because they find they actually don't want to eat that whole chocolate cake every night and it was the “rules” that made it seem so enticing.

Some might gain weight & keep it - mostly because they were trying so hard to maintain a shape that wasn't meant for them. 

Intuitive Eating teaches that it wouldn't be fair to ourselves and our quality of life to try to fit a certain shape- just like it wouldn't be fair to try squeezing on a pair of size  shoes as a person with size  feet.

you won't have to follow anyone else's plan but your own ;)

Coming up to  years ago now and on a family holiday in Greece, I walked along the beach hiding my body under a dress and cried. I felt incredibly insecure, ashamed of what I looked like, and had not yet come to terms with how my body was changing and that it *needed* to change.
-
Since then, it's been long, slow and steady journey of self-growth and self-acceptance. I'm not going to make out that it's all been easy, because it really hasn't. I've had a lot of highs and lows, better days and worse days. But about  years into this process it's felt like I've just been climbing upwards.

A lot of you are familiar with my mental health journey, and I'd say that this was the final stage of recovery I needed to go through. In fact, the other day was the first time I'd put on a bikini in a long time, and it felt so liberating to not overthink anything and just ✨ live ✨ in my own skin.

Doc ID: 2359, distribution: 1.0 ; Eating for balance AND enjoyment because both are important, and we LOVE fuelling our bodies around here!!

For a really long time, I saw food as this thing that I constantly craved but ignored... Something that held power over me & made me feel incredibly guilty... Something that I relied on for comfort, so-much-so I'd continue to eat until my tummy felt super uncomfortable, or on the other end of the spectrum, would restrict & not allow myself to have certain foods at all.

If you've had a tricky relationship with food across the span of your life so far, you're not alone. But food isn't the enemy, it's what gives us the energy to function, plus if we allow it, it can be FUN, social & enjoyable.

Letting go of the food rules, the guilt, the expectations, the shame & finding the balance that works for ME has been so healing & life-changing. 

I really hope this encourages you to honour your hunger, listen to your cravings, fuel your body well & let go of any negative connotations you have when you think of food. It's not linear & it won't happen overnight, but it IS possible to allow food to simply be food.

Disclaimer: I don't eat the same meals every day, each day is different, but this was what I felt like on this particular day & I thought it would be fun to create a video showcasing the lightheartedness & enjoyment I now feel around eating :)

I haven't stopped thinking about her words.  I wondered that I had looked in the mirror that very morning and wanted to climb back under my covers and hide from the world (because being aware of patriarchal beauty standards as socially constructed does not make it easier to not internalize them).   I wondered at how loud the fear was: I did not feel particularly confident that day. In fact, I felt scared and unsure about the future and finances and how anything would work out.  I wondered that appearing confident at all times meant to her that the trauma responses or eating disorder urges could not possibly exist in a Confident Body.   I think as a society we have such a limited understanding of mental health.   So here are some of my truths:  #: It's not about my body. Some days I struggle with body image, but some days I do not. It's rarely what drives my eating patterns, but my body can at times be a site of contention when it comes to feeling beautiful. While it's important to talk about it, I try not to center it in my discussions of eating disorders precisely because of the assumption that one must hate themselves or feel fat to deal with an ED. Those can absolutely be symptoms for some folks, but certainly not for everyone and they are rarely the root cause of the disorder.  #: So why do I have urges to restrict? Most often it is because trauma causes me to disconnect from my body, leading to me not take care of my body as I should. When Old Voices come calling, restricting caloric intake is a way to numb out / not feel / be out of my body.   #: Self-love and struggle can both exist. I can feel perfectly confident in who I am as a human some days, but that doesn't erase the struggle of living with c-ptsd or battling a Monster in my mind that tells me to escaping into the foggy haze of starvation again will solve my problems. I can love myself all the live long day, but I still have to learn how to cope in healthy ways with a brain that is a little bit broken (I say that in the sense of a broken leg, just for my brain) from past harm.

if you don't know what i'm talking about, in september, i decided to go “all in” which has now become a popular recovery term, so let me give you a summary of what “all in” was to ME. i had recovered from my eating disorder a few months PRIOR to deciding to go “all in” (i say this b/c at the time, i felt comfortable eating all foods, didn't experience food guilt, wasn't battling my ed voice anymore, etc.), but i chose to start an “all in” journey aka eating until complete fullness and whenever i even *thought* about wanting food and accepting any and all weight gain that came along with that because even though i felt free around food, i felt really out of tune with my body.  i hardly ever felt truly satiated, thought about food often in between eating, had no sex drive, got cold easy, had irregular periods, and was always tired, so i decided to go “all in” even if that meant gaining excess weight with the goal of feeling my best.

i haven't talked about my “all in” journey in a while because tbh, i hardly think about it. i hardly think about what i eat in general anymore because food no longer takes up more mental space than it needs to.  over the course of the past  months, i gained weight and also gained so much more awareness of and confidence in myself, and i feel the best i have in years. i still eat past fullness sometimes, emotionally eat, and have days where i overthink what i want to eat, but nobody's perfect, and there's beauty in that.  i'm not “ending” my process because eating whatever i want whenever i want has just become more of a lifestyle choice that works for me.

since “all in” has become really popular in the eating disorder recovery community, i also wanted to say to those of you who are recovering that there's no right or wrong way to recover.  recovery is so individual. no matter if you're going “all in”, following a meal plan, in treatment, or taking things one step at a time, you are choosing to fight and that's what matters most. it's so important in recovery AND life to not compare your journey to anyone else's, to stay in your own lane, and to do what works and is best for YOU.

Do you think it's possible or do you see it more as remission or something you'll always live with? Do you think there's still progress for you to make or this is as good as it gets? Are you at peace with where you're at or do you find it impacts your life too much still? Sorry for the many questions! Xxx Answer: I know there's different views on this and I'm happy for others to take a different view to me. I don't think there's a point where you say Bam! That's full recovery! and then off you go into the world and never think of any eating related struggles again. However I definitely believe people can get to a point where they no longer meet the official diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. So I suppose it depends on what you class as recovery.For me, I would be daft to take my eye off the recovery ball. If I were to say I am recovered and then I get complacent about monitoring myself, it could be a slippery slope back into disordered behaviours. I'm % at peace with where I'm at. There's bits I would like to sort out, but I could live the rest of my life being ok with where things are now. I'm working on those bits in therapy right now.Personally I think there are some unrealistic ideas about recovery out there. This idea that you will be able to eat whatever you like and never think about it, the idea that if you ever find yourself saying No thankyou to extras or to dessert you need to push through that, etc etc. That's not normal eating. Normal eating does require an element of mindfulness. I'm mindful about what my children eat, are they having adequate fruit and vegetables, are they eating balanced meals, do they enjoy sweet things without going crazy over them and so on, and I apply that same mindfulness to my own eating. There's more to nutrition than just weight. We don't know what is going on inside us and we have to respect our bodies if we want them to stay healthy  into old age.Having said that, none of that means that if someone needs to weight restore they shouldn't get on and do it by whatever means works for them.

Its not a good place to be. Never build your mental health on lies. Its REALLY great that you noticed this and are aware of it. REALLY great. Because you now have the choice to take the next step toward real recovery and the next step AWAY from ed. % recovery is just living without an eating disorder. and that shit takes WORK. hard work. I want you to know youre feelings about it are normal. it happens waayy too often i promise you, youre not a loser or faking anything. Normies dont question themselves like this.

Doc ID: 14634, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // third instalment   Welcome to the third and final instalment of this weeks therapy session! I had five things on my list for this session, and so far we'd got through two of them and we had ten minutes left 🙄 I looked at the remaining three things and thought which one could I get through in the time, and then I froze up for a minute while I ran through opening lines for the options in my head. It's frustrating when I do this, because taking a minute to decide what can be said in ten minutes means that I end up with only nine minutes to say it in. Why can't I just be a talky talky external processor?! I went with my debate about my weight. I've done really well throughout  barely weighing myself and it's been much better, so from that I conclude it's mentally much healthier for me not to know my weight and that I can trust my body and I can trust myself to fairly accurately predict what my weight is doing because I know my body well now. However as soon as I think about releasing the need to know my weight, the fear and shame of being  years old again and being sent to weigh myself and being so ashamed and horrified by the number comes back to haunt me. I explained all this to T, and she reflected it back to me and missed the point a bit so I clarified and she adjusted and then she did get it. We were down to the last few minutes at this point, but she said “Maybe that's something you could ask God to help you with?” I totally understand her bringing it back to God. We are both Christians and I do believe that God can heal our minds and bodies, but when she said it, I felt a flash of frustration. I didn't say it out loud, but what I thought was “Ugh T only said that because she doesn't know what to say” followed by “I don't want God to fix it, I want you to fix it!” We were out of time, in fact over time, at that point so there wasn't any time to talk more about it. T did say maybe there's more to be said on the subject and we can continue with it next week if I want to.

Doc ID: 15860, distribution: 0.5347468429607387 ; Question: What was it that made you choose and do recovery. I'm on the fence all the time and wonder what is it that will give me that push to choose full on recovery.  Answer: I don't think there was ever a magic moment where I said right! everything is recovery from this point! When I started therapy, all I wanted to do was get control over my bingeing and purging. I wanted to be able to eat like a normal person - go out for a meal without it turning into a disaster. I didn't want to stop restricting or gain any weight though. Gradually as one aspect improved and I felt better, I was motivated to work on the next thing. I discovered how nice it was to live without all the negative impacts of restriction - to feel warm again! to not be snappy with my family! That motivated me not to fall back and to keep pressing forward.My therapist has been a big help, gently pushing me forward all the time and holding my progress when I slip back.I think what I'm saying is for some people there is a moment where they fully commit to full recovery and just go for it, and that's fantastic. I'm more of a little by little person, so taking baby steps towards recovery worked better for me. I feel like it's built me a solid foundation so that even when I slip, I have lots of ground underneath to catch me. Different things work for different people so only you know what will work for you and also you may need some trial and error to see what that is. But don't do nothing! Take the risk and try something and see how it goes. If it doesn't feel right at least on some level, try something else. Go for it x

——
the past  months for me have been ones of major growth. my mindset around food has drastically shifted, i eat whenever and whatever i want to, i haven't binge-ate since the spring, and i don't think as much about food, my body, or the two of them together. although i feel confident saying i have finally healed my relationship with food, i am always cold, i have irregular periods, my sex drive is really low, i'm not getting stronger in the gym, and i almost never feel full despite eating ~- calories a day, which are all effects of having too low of body fat.
——
so, i am going “All In”, a process that i feel inspired to do from following @stephanie_buttermore's current “All In” journey.  this is something that i started to do earlier in my recovery journey, but couldn't commit to and didn't follow through with when i developed binge eating disorder.  now that i feel like i'm in a really good spot with my relationship to food, i'm ready to get my body functioning the way a healthy body does.
——
basically, i will continue to eat whenever and whatever i want to feel good (so, mostly real whole foods, but definitely also plenty of not as nutritious foods) until complete satiety aka until i actually feel full. i've been doing this for  days now, and if that means getting double everything in my chipotle bowl, drinking a smoothie, and eating a bar to feel full at lunch (which is just one example of a meal i've eaten the past couple days), then i'm going to eat it- no judgements or inhibitions.
——
i'm initially going to gain weight. but, then it will plateau, my hunger levels will start to decrease, and with a higher metabolism, my body will naturally let go of the “extra weight” until it reaches it's natural set weight.  i'm doing this process, which may take  months,  months, a year, or even longer with the goal of allowing my body to fully trust me, find it's natural set point, and start functioning properly, so that my hormones become more regulated, i have more energy, and i'm able to live a happier and healthier life, which as you know, is always my goal 🦋

Doc ID: 12525, distribution: 1.0 ; [tw: eating disorder] I cried for the entirety of our fifty minute therapy session, crumpled tissues piling high next to me, after she asked me what it was exactly about the eating disorder that I did not want to go back to.  As I described to her in between sobs what is is to survive ten years of violence inflicted upon your own body, something inside of me seemed to break. Remembering the nights of raw throated agony as I kneeled before a toilet bowl to pay my penance for my sins / the days of primal hunger as my stomach burned and my muscles ached, there was a sense of sheer terror that I would ever return to that life of suffering. And yet it pulls at me, the Monster, always calling me backwards towards sickness, towards dying, towards pain. It roars in my head that there is something unclean running through my veins that must be dug out; that I have, merely by existing, perpetrated the greatest of all crimes, transgressed the laws of the gods, and I must spend the rest of my days on my knees repenting. I have spent a lifetime, all of my short twenty-six years on this earth, atoning for sins that I have never even committed.  Are the gods satisfied yet?                                                             ….. “Maybe,” she says slowly, weighing her words, “maybe, you have suffered enough.” I grab another tissue and hug my knees to my chest. It is deeply violent to deprive your body of the necessary calories it needs to survive, to heave and convulse before a toilet bowl altar, to run until your body is on the verge of collapse. What is it to live through trauma that is of your own making? What is it to live through such extreme violence at your own hands?  For so long I have numbed myself to the reality of what I was doing, but I felt the gravity of it all in that moment, telling her about how I used to lay in bed, counting my too-slow heartbeats to make sure I was still alive, all the while praying that I was not. Because, I tell her, to wake up and live another day meant listening to the Monster's orders, being a slave to Its sadistic whims and I couldn't bear that one more day.  I choke down more tears.  Reliving those days, those haunted days, brings up gut-wrenching pain. Yet I have begun to listen to the Monster again lately, buying into Its silver-tongued promises and rose-colored visions of safety and control. I know better, know that the life it offers is a life against my values.  But It's just one snack.  One run. One meal. One day. One week. One life. And I can feel myself falling again, spiraling into the dark place where I cannot choose for myself but can only obey / obey / obey the Monster.  This is not the life that I want. I don't want to go back to living as the dead, to walking around half-girl, half-ghost. I am terrified of being forced into living against myself again, committing violence against my body, directed by my mind.  She tells me that I have a choice in this, that I am giving away my power too easily, and I don't know that I believe her. I want to, but it doesn't feel true.                                                        ….. Just eat your food, Lindsay, I tell myself, eat your damn food.  I am sitting at a restaurant with friends, smiling and laughing and talking as though I were not starving myself to death.  The full plate of food in front of me makes my stomach growl and the hunger pangs grow stronger.  I can hear the therapist's voice in my head, Think about the life that you want. This is not what you want.  But the voice of the Monster is loud and strong, and I feel small and weak in comparison.                                                          ….. “I don't know how to want to eat,” I tell her.  “You won't want to,” she says, “You just have to go through the motions for a while before it gets easier.”  I open the door to the refrigerator, close it, and then open it again.  I do not want to eat. But I am so very tired of pain, always pain. I am so very tired of dying.  I am so very tired of the hellish existence that is my eating disorder. I get out a plate. I make no promises for tomorrow, I tell her. I'm not committing myself to recovery and rainbows and sunshine. I don't know that I am even capable of beating back the Monster for any extended length of time. The Monster's grip on me is tight. But maybe - I hesitate before continuing - maybe just for this one meal, I have suffered enough.

Doc ID: 9767, distribution: 1.0 ; my life is not even close to “perfect”, it's not very exciting, and i am definitely not happy and joyful all the time, but at the end of the day, i love it and am so grateful for it.

sometimes i forget all the pain and hardship that i've been through to get to where i am now. while i still struggle with mental health and have moments when life feels really hard, i can confidently say that my low points now are still better than my high points when i was in the depths of my eating disorder.

it can be easy to romanticize eating disorders and to think that times when you were thinner or had a sense of control, life was better. i know i've had those thoughts. truth is, life for me during my eating disorders sucked pretty hard. i was a manipulative liar, i missed out on so many experiences that i will never get to have, i couldn't develop long-lasting relationships, i was in a toxic relationship with myself, and my entire mind was consumed by thoughts around food, my body, and numbers.

when things get hard now, remember to keep choosing LIFE. going backwards isn't an option, so what are you going to with your next step forward? there is so much life out there, and you deserve to live it, like really truly live it, to its fullest. i promise the fight to break free is worth it.

Doc ID: 12465, distribution: 1.0 ; In the past, some of my logic for staying stuck in the eating disorder was, “But what if life doesn't get better afterwards? Like what if I recover / weight restore / stop using X behavior and life is still awful, but I just have no way to cope with it?” And I was surprised how many times in treatment I heard a similar sentiment from my peers. I remember a friend talking about how she was so afraid that the trauma and pain and misery would still be present if she let go of using disordered behaviors that she would rather stay in the misery she knew - a familiar, safe misery.   We had both staying in the hell for fear that there was hell on the other side.  But what if we were wrong? I know, I know, you may not fully buy that, but hear me out: What if?  Hold space for that question for a moment: What if your vision of the future right now is distorted, because the fog of the disorder is so heavy around your mind that you can't see clearly what's ahead of you? What if you recover and let go and it's not more pain? What if you can create a life that you actually want to present in, one in which you don't have to numb out constantly just to survive?  Here's what I'm not saying: life will be pain-free and sparkly-glittery-unicorns every second of every day. Life is complex and filled with all kinds of experiences, but Y'ALL. What if we were wrong about everything? What if there is actually so much goodness ahead of us?  Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't it worth fighting with every ounce of energy we have left in our tired bodies to get to the other side?  It's easier to succumb to the siren song of the disorder, a song of protection from pain and numbness to the trauma we've faced. I'm not asking you to commit to recovery or give up your self-destructive behaviors. I'm asking you to consider, even just for a second: What if you were wrong about hope?

I don't know who else to ask this and I'm sorry if this is a triggering or touchy subject.Do you have any advice on how to control overeating after a long time of restricting?I feel like Whenever i try to eat I'm either undereating or overeating and it's hard to find a balance  Answer: this isnt a triggering question at all - in fact i love this question bc there isnt any clear answer to this anywhere and finding balance is how u end up healing urself. but thank u for being conscientious lmao. yal shldnt have to worry abt triggering me i try to stay above that and honestly i dont mind triggers bc in the grand scheme of things its making you tougher and ultimately you're in control of how u react to things but ANYWYZ  are if you're thinkin rly hard this entire time, youll be able to stop yourself at one or two healthy snacks. an hour or two may pass, you might feel hungry again. EAT SOMETHING SMALL AGAIN. dont beat yourself up. if you binge, you binge. stay present. pay attention to how your body feels, not how you feel. if you feel full, wait. give your digestive system a chance to digest and adjust and keep up. its been through a lot so your signals may be all out of wack and you may feel terrible but you must perservere because theres actuallya science to pacing yourself and if you can commit to this for just a little bit youll start to notice small results and then you turn that into momentum!!if your body's signals are screwy from years and months of abuse, you must override with the power of the brain. force yourself to eat small meals often, dont let your ghrelin and leptin dictate if you know better that they are off. take the pain, be present in it, remember if for next time. if you can get thru this your body will come round eventually and youll be able to start gauging hunger more accurately.. which helps when you're working on control of portions (not over or under eating) because you dont have to think about control at this point - eventually you'll be able to relinquish that control and just listen to your body. but for now you gotta know better. i realize this might not be entirely helpful but its the best advice i got. restricting and bingeing is a cyclic hell and its very hard to break but not impossible and believing you can is a very powerful component to accomplishing this. i wish u the best of luck anon 🖤and im sorry if this tangent wasnt helpful

when blake and i spend evenings together (most nights), he sits in the kitchen when i cook myself extra meals (or cooks them for me) and walks to chipotle with me when i want a burrito bowl as a snack.  sometimes, he'll eat these extra meals or snacks with me, but a lot of times he doesn't and just gives me company. do i get bothered that i eat significantly more than him even though he's got  inches and  pounds on me? no, because i know our body's dietary needs are SO individual, and if i want food, it doesn't make sense not to go get some.
——
i remember reading something along the lines of:

feeling hungry is like the urge to pee- it's your body's signal of telling you what it needs. if you honor your body by going to the bathroom when it needs to go, why don't you honor your body and eat when it needs food?

next time you catch yourself comparing what you eat to what someone else eats, feeling like you “shouldn't” eat more, or judging yourself for eating, ask yourself “do i judge myself when I need to pee more than someone else? do i beat myself up every time i feel the urge to go? do i think it's better to push off peeing until you just can't hold it any longer?” if you answer no, why don't you apply that same logic to feeling hungry?
——
p.s. i know the comparison isn't exactly equal, and there's a lot of additional science that i'm not acknowledging here, but i found this comparison to be light-hearted, easy to comprehend, and possibly helpful in moments of doubt, so i thought i'd share :)

To be honest it's weird to say I'm an “influencer” even after almost three years of doing this. When I'm in my off-the-Internet  life and I'm asked about my in-the-net work, I suddenly feel thrown off. Like there's this person I have to conjure up to relate to what I think they know about me. Like I have to be who they expect me to be because they've seen my page before. But that gets so exhausting so fast. It's not that i am someone totally different on IG, or fake or pretending to be someone I'm not, it's just that I regularly feel like conforming to an image I've made of myself. Sometimes I feel like when ppl talk to me who don't hang out with me regularly don't really know me... but that's not their fault. It's me just trying to be something likeable to the masses. Also the fact that i get exhausted really fast from small talk might contribute to that so I'm really the only person to blame here haha. It's so easy to get stuck trying to appeal to everyone but what's the point when I am not appealing to myself? I just end up feeling weird when I discuss my page with my family members who think I'm all about recipes and food and inspiration and veganism and fitness and nutrition. Because I feel like I'm so much more than that. I just know that I'm ME and I want to share ME. My life happens to consist of some of those things, yes, but there's more and I'm determined to unapologetically, unabashedly express who I am. Maybe you guys already see that in me and maybe this is just an internal conflict I'm having. I just feel like someone can relate here.

Sorry for the essayDude I get it. Choosing recovery is literally a daily thing. And its a daily battle. And its exhausting, and scary. But it is sooo so worth it. Recovery is not instant, nor is it linear. You get good days, great days, and horrible rotten shitty days. But as long as you continue to choose recovery, you WILL get to the other side. Your brain and body have been in ED mode for how long?? One day of recovery is not going to heal that. This is going to take time, and I know thats one of the worst parts.. but patience will get you there. Your body and brain need time to untangle everything and get itself back to normal. Meanwhile you just have to let it do what its going to do and continue to eat some good ass food without worry. I know its so fucking hard to be making these choices on your own. I never went res but I would think it would make it easier as I would be forced to do it But that only helps your body, not your brain. Want recovery every day.

I had found it easy to eat a really good breakfast because I knew we would then be walking all morning and a) I needed energy to do that and b) I would be burning off what I ate. I don't know if it's unhealthy to justify it like this but it was the reality of the situation. Lunch and dinner there was always loads of vegetables and I made sure I ate some protein as well, although the amount of that available was limited but I did eat adequate amounts. I just tended to avoid the carbs, although I always had some bread. I said I hadn't found the eating difficult, I was always full after meals, and I hadn't felt like I was obsessing over food between meals or feeling unwell or any of the other things that tend to happen when I'm restricting. I told her how it got harder when we came out of the desert because maybe I had gradually built up a calorie deficit and my body was trying to catch up now more food was available. I tried to explain how awful and out of control it feels when my brain and body are working against each other, even if I kind of know what's going on, it's hard to trust either my brain or my body, and I end up having all sorts of urges. At least I could honestly say I hadn't been purging (vomiting) despite having a lot of thoughts about it. The main thing that stopped me is that I haven't done it for so long now that I would be so mad with myself if I took that massive step backwards, and I know it would start a downward spiral. It's just shameful to think about it afterwards though and think how tempting it felt. I did manage to confess rather shamefully to what I'd ended up doing (chewing and spitting) and how things were a bit rough but I figure I just need to ride it out and I will come through it and back into a settled pattern of eating soon enough [which a week later, I have] We got through all that and to a bit of a pause, and after a bit of silence T said “Do you want to keep talking about food or do you want to talk about something else?” I thought for a bit and said that I didn't think that I had anything more to say about food but I wasn't sure what else to talk about. “Because you have too many options?” T asked. “No, I just don't know what to talk about.” “Ok… so we could talk about what is happening with d… or we could talk about your letter to your mum…”

Doc ID: 9457, distribution: 1.0 ; how can you feel like your body is your home if you're viewing it as a temporary place to live?

i'm not anti-having body-related goals, and i believe in body autonomy, but i also think there are a lot of people who use trying to manipulate and change their bodies as a way to try and find self-love and self-acceptance when true self-love and self-acceptance are not things that come from being a certain size or fitting into a certain image or box.

i spent a lot of years at war with my body, constantly blaming my body, resenting my body, and trying to control my body. i viewed my body as being separate from me and something that was temporary. the truth i had to face was that whether i liked what i saw in the mirror or not, i only ever have one body, and it's the forever home to my soul. 

you can't hate yourself or your body into a person or body you love, and the only way to really feel at home and comfortable in your skin is through unconditional acceptance.

loving your body isn't about loving how it looks all the time. gentle reminder that you don't have to love how your body looks to choose to take care of it, be kind to it, nourish it, and accept it.

I exist in your worst nightmare. ⁣
⁣
Of course you may not know it. Don't worry. I know it. You know how I know? Because my eating disorder made it very clear that my body was not acceptable. And eating disorders pretty much all think a lot of things the same way. And that is that fat is bad. Large is bad. ⁣
⁣
And here I am. Fat. Super fat actually. ⁣
⁣
Oh. And I'm black. ⁣
⁣
And while you may not overtly admit that is your worst nightmare if you are white, I can guarantee it's up there. ⁣
⁣
To be black is to be hated.⁣
⁣
To be monstrous and threading. ⁣
⁣
To be loud and boisterous. ⁣
⁣
To be killed. ⁣
⁣
To be lynched. ⁣
⁣
Who would willingly sign up for a body that rains that down upon you?⁣
⁣
And who would wish being the “wrong color” and the “wrong size” in a world where being “right” is social currency?⁣
⁣
All around me I watch people exchange their thigh gaps and jiggly free arms and flat stomachs and thin fingers for the social purchases of the world. ⁣
⁣
Relationships⁣
⁣
Jobs⁣
⁣
Clothes⁣
⁣
Likes ❤️⁣
⁣
They exchange their thinness for these things and never think about it. ⁣
⁣
And yet I'm left trying to bargain with a ripped dollar. ⁣
⁣
Don't get my wrong. I am okay with my body now. It's taken a long time but I'm here. We're neutral. Some days we're more. I don't sit at my desk and daydream of Hollister jeans. But that doesn't make me unaware of what goes on in the world around me.⁣
⁣
I know your eating disorder says run far away from any life that looks like me. ⁣
⁣
But I am here to tell you that you can exist like me. You can thrive like me. You can respect yourself like me. You can eat. And you can grow. ⁣
⁣
You are so much more than your body.

It would be so easy to portray the image on the left as my everyday self & hide all of the features we've been taught to hate.

I personally spent years yo-yo dieting, self-loathing & following unhealthy fad d!ets because of the pressure I felt to look a certain way, but none of it ever worked or stuck.

And as I learned how to create a more balanced & healthy approach to my lifestyle & habits, I realised I never saw anyone who appeared to live a “fit & healthy lifestyle” still have belly fat, wobbly legs & arms, loose skin, stretch marks, back acne & so many other things I've seen on myself. 

I thought something was wrong with me.

This is why I'm here now, to show you that:
🧘🏻‍♀️ a healthy, balanced lifestyle shouldn't be restrictive or miserable
🥰 having very normal human features - like wobbly, jiggly, dimply bits - isn't something you need to “fix” or hate… it's simply part of being human, all bodies are different!
⚡️ food & body fat isn't your enemy, it's ENERGY
🥹 you are already good enough
💪 our bodies will forever fluctuate & change, so learning to respect it for what it does for you is life-changing
⚠️ no amount of external validation will make you love yourself… self acceptance comes from the inside.
🪞 the way things look on the outside may not be a reflection of how things actually are on the inside. The measures people take to live a certain lifestyle may not be realistic for you, so you cannot compare yourself!!
🫂 the body on the left isn't the way I look all the time & I hope to be just one person who shows you that you can show up as you are, because I wouldn't have been able to truly accept myself if I didn't embrace ALL of me. 

I know my posts won't resonate with everyone, but I do hope it reaches those it will help in some way! Happy Real Me Monday 🫶

Doc ID: 2534, distribution: 0.3958357551903709 ; What if instead of viewing your body as this work in progress, this thing that you wish to change, this thing you *will* love one day, but only once it's smaller, firmer, more “beautiful”…. You view your body, in the exact shape and size it is now, as the version of your body you'll have forever instead. If it were to never change & forever be the exact same, do you think you can put in the effort to TRY to appreciate it? Instead of being unkind to it?

I think for so many of us, we view our bodies as this thing that needs to be fixed. We don't really even try to accept it or be happy with it because we believe that only happens when we reach a certain physique, shape, size. But problems are still problems in a size . So, what if we start being kinder to it now? 

Idk about you, but I'm not willing to settle for a life of self-loathing & low self-esteem 🙅‍♀️

Here are some tips to create a better relationship with your body & mind that personally helped me:

🌟 What you focus on is what you give power to! Be kind to yourself 😘

🌟 If your mind isn't in a good place, try not to look in the mirror. 

🌟 If you're having a bad body image day, do something that brings you joy & show yourself some self love!

🌟 Repeat affirmations to yourself every day, until you start to think them naturally!

🌟 Throw away clothes that don't fit you. They don't serve you anymore 🤗

🌟 Throw away the scales. The number doesn't define you! 

🌟 Nourish your body well… Enjoy the food you eat. Fuel yourself with food that makes you feel good, inside & out.

🌟 Make some time to move your body, whether it's stretching, walking, dancing, bodyweight exercises, or hitting PBs at the gym. Move in whichever way makes you feel best. Your body is powerful & strong! 

🌟 Consume content online that inspires you, motivates you & leaves you feeling better, not worse. If that means finding new people to follow & others to unfollow, so be it. Your mental health comes first 💛

T has done some adoption counselling in the past and so she knows what she's talking about.  We moved on to talking about food. I'd sent T a text the day before, saying I was worried about telling her my weight because it wasn't good. And then a lot of waffle about why it might have dropped so much. Then, in an effort to show I was trying to take some responsibility for it, I sent another text with a picture of my lunch (which always looks like a HUGE bowl of food) and said that I had eaten three scrambled eggs for breakfast because I was not feeling well at all and knew I needed more. T got far too excited by the three scrambled eggs. She said how great it was that I recognised I was feeling unwell and ate more as a result. Ugh, I didn't think it was that big a deal. I have eaten three eggs for breakfast on a few previous occasions.  I sat there facing a resolutely happy T telling me how well I'm doing, while I'm just thinking about how terribly I'm doing. I want her to ask what my weight is, because I'm not trying to hide it from her. I just felt that if I texted it straight out to her, it would be open to misinterpretation as to how I felt about it. Why isn't she asking? We aren't following our usual session pattern here… I don't like it. “In the past, even a little bit last session, you have needed me to be the adult, because adult-Faith hasn't been able to take charge and look after child-Faith. But here I can see your adult getting on board and making some healthy decisions. You are recognising things aren't great and doing something about it…. maybe not doing enough about it, but it's a start.” I looked very doubtfully at her. I don't get it. I lost a load of weight but managed to eat an extra egg and this is somehow a good thing? We spent abot  minutes of the session stop-starting this conversation, sitting in silence, and then not really arguing but not really connecting either. T trying to avoid diving into the food conversation and me trying to get her to dive in there anyway. Eventually she looked at me and said “Do you want to carry on talking about this? We can talk about something else, or do you want to push through with this?” It felt like she didn't want to carry on talking about it. But I didn't have anything else particular to talk about and I didn't feel like we'd really talked about what we needed to yet. I felt like T had just tiptoed round the edge of it.

it's wild and incredible thinking about how i used to be OBSESSED about food and my body and felt the need to plan out my meals DAYS in advance and how i now unconditionally accept my body without second thought (i don't always “love” it, but i always accept it) and don't usually know what i'm eating for dinner until dinner time comes.

i remember so clearly thinking full freedom wasn't possible for me, and that being where i am now would never happen. yet, here i am after a lot of non-linear healing and can confidently say recovery IS possible and IS worth it.

here's a list of some the things i love most about no longer dieting and some reasons why you should keep going in your recovery:

- going out to eat at a restaurant and ordering what sounds good in the moment without having to look up calories or macros in advance
- having the energy and mental space to do the things that are important to me
- not having a number on the scale dictate how my mood is gonna be that day
- eating ice cream whenever i feel like it without any feelings of guilt or shame
- finding joy in exercise and moving in ways that feel good for me
- having an abundance mindset around food and not having to bring “safe” snacks with me everywhere
- being able to connect with people more
- not having my life consumed with thoughts about food and my body

if you need to hear this reminder: the rules, beliefs, and messages about food and bodies that were engrained into your brain for years aren't just going to get unlearned and replaced overnight. keep going in your healing. i promise it's worth it.

p.s. the cheese tortellini from @miabellarestaurant is the best pasta dish in cleveland. bold statement, i know, but it's really that good.

Doc ID: 23996, distribution: 0.5461751193553812 ; Question: How did you recover from your eating disorder? Did you see a therapist or go to a treatment center? Did you recover on your own? I'm struggling so hard right now. I'm trying to force myself to eat, but I keep crying after every meal and I honestly feel so disgusting. It feels like it doesn't get easier.  Answer: first of all, i'm sorry you're having such a rough time. and to be honest with you right off the bat - it only gets a little bit easier at first. you have to work really damn hard for incremental results. your struggles will just evolve into new ones as you go… that scope might not help if you're feeling overwhelmed but its the truth. everything is a challenge, but i will say that letting yourself continue to go deeper into the dark abyss is much more strenuous physically and emotionally, than recovering. recovering is more mentally strenuous because it requires you to evolve, to rewire the way you think. and that's not to say that you still wont be stuck with the physical ailments and side effects from your ed… because you will. the longer you stay sick, the harder it will be to get better.  staying sick, and getting better, are both challenges. but one leads you nowhere … and the other offers a path to redemption - even if you don't believe in it. my recovery unfolded because first, i got caught. i probably would've been dead by now if my parents hadn't discovered my collection of ziplock puke bags, that i'd been stashing in my room like a degenerate. my secret was out but i tried my best to convince my parents i could stop myself and handle it. i couldnt stop myself, lol. so they started (attempting to) monitoring everything i ate and forcing me to eat meals with them. well. i should say they. my mother (when she lived in the household) was the driving authoritarian force behind my recovery. i never did inpatient for my ed (but have def been before for other reasons lol) but i did get sent through the ringer of psychologists, psychiatrists, and dieticians. i was going to appointments like x a week. i loathed spending time at home because even when i had the opportunity to eat and eat normally, my mom was guarding food and really domineering/controlling about what i could have. & that tbh, made everything feel a lot worse. i stopped purging only because she watched me, and inspected everything. even when i hadnt purged she'd accuse me of doing so if she saw a speck on the toilet bowl. at one point i was hiding puke bags in the tile cieling of the basement in her condo that was my “room”. or i'd vomit in her shower and shove everything down the drain with my bare hands. eventually i gave up on purging because it just became too hard to do, and because i saw a dentist for the first time in  years and it WASNT lookin good for me. my ed has given me approx  cavities and a root canal… at this point i was still sick mentally and physically despite seeing a bunch of doctors who asked me the same questions that never seemed to help. its easy to lie to health professionals if you dont really want help. easy to convince them that you're doing better than you really are. so then i was still managing to binge but wasnt purging… and eventually on my own, after ditching the doctors after like a year of useless therapy… i began to learn how to control my portion size. the invasive thoughts slowly lessened.  just took a lot of self reflection & introspection. around this time i was turning , my mother and i had our final falling out and i was no longer forced to stay with her. which made bingeing easier but i naturally just stopped doing it, given that my environment had improved tenfold just by not having to be in her presence. i was just too exhausted to stuff myself anymore, i couldnt tolerate any more pain.  i still had major digestion problems and discomfort even with normal portions so after a long stab at recovery i slipped back into disordered ways and started restricting. by this point my brain was less concerned with calories and weight, and more concerned with just feeling “pure”. not feeling disgusting. not having to deal with painful digestion. i had  bouts with anorexia, i managed to rebound myself once after the first time, when i got really into vegan health foods. depression got the best of me after a while though and i slipped back into not eating. at this point i wasnt even concerned with the pain or my health or anything at all, i was just too tired to function outside of maintaining a job so that involved not feeding myself. i lasted maybe  months or so on barely any food before i collapsed at home and was bed ridden for weeks. i was at my lowest weight and my dad took notice and took it upon himself to meal prep for me. he just approached me one day and was like “have u been eating” and i was like “no i cant”. he understood bc he's been in my position before …cuz when my mother lived with us he'd hide in the basement every day, slept there too. he was barely eating. my dad was a grown man at like lbs and recovered himself. sorry this is so long ill finish up in a text post after this

Im happy you sent this. This mini rant is not directed to you personally, i promise. youre cool as hell. )man everybody really needs to stop assigning rankings and levels to eating disorders and recovery. theres no leveling system for how bad an ed is or successful recovery is. theres no percentage. thats all made up to make you feel like shit. theres no such thing as % sick or % sick or % sick. either you are sick or you are not. either you are struggling or you are not. The fact that you even entered recovery in the first place PROVES you were sick. Who the fuck cares ““what percentage”“ of sick you were. that shit isnt real. Your ed just wants you to feel like ass and pretend it was never “that bad” so you'll come back to it. its all a manipulation tactic. its bullshit. “Sorry you have % cancer, not enough for any kind of treatment, we are gonna wait until you waste away to % cancer to do anything about it” ??????????? thats not how this works. and on the topic of quasi recovery.. i see that shit everywhere. and so many people slip into it when they get the idea that they werent % sick to begin with.. so they cling to the ed, because maybe THIS TIME they WILL be % sick enough.. but they disguise it as recovery to make everyone else happy. Its not a good place to be. Never build your mental health on lies. Its REALLY great that you noticed this and are aware of it. REALLY great. Because you now have the choice to take the next step toward real recovery and the next step AWAY from ed. “% recovery” is just living without an eating disorder. and that shit takes WORK. hard work. I want you to know youre feelings about it are normal. it happens waayy too often i promise you, youre not a loser or faking anything. Normies dont question themselves like this. Normies dont even consider questioning themselves like this. All sickness needs healing no matter what degree of pain someone is in.

Doc ID: 7299, distribution: 0.6455815493791777 ; my recovery from my eating disorder was a time in my life marked by loss, release, and acceptance.

i personally struggled with restrictive eating and overexercising. every eating disorder looks different, and not all include these elements. this is my story. it's one tale of thousands.

when i committed to my truest recovery, i had to gain a significant amount of weight to restore my body's health and functioning. i swore i could accomplish this while also holding onto all of the toxic behaviors that got me to this point. i was in denial. i insisted i could have it all.

i wanted to gain weight and recover and still eat diet-esque “safe” foods. i wanted to gain weight and recover and still work out every single day. i pleaded with my parents and treatment team. i justified my choices. looking back, i can't believe i kept a straight face as i begged them to let me work out “because i just love it so much”.

you know when i finally recovered? when i healed my relationship with food and exercise. and you know when i did THAT? when i finally let go of my need for control, surrendered my obsessions, and accepted my reality. when i finally shut up and followed my meal plan. when i finally shut up and complied with a  month total exercise restriction.

this comes from a place of love, but that love is tough love. if you loved “eating healthy” and “working out” for the ACTUAL RIGHT REASONS, you'd be willing to give up your control around them if it meant finding true health and happiness. the right reasons to love these things are simple: you love to eat well and move because these acts contribute to a sense of peace and serenity within. if you're using either of these to hurt yourself, how can you love them for the right reasons? you simply can't. it's time to be real and face all the irrational lies.

there's no healing without loss, release, and acceptance. all discomfort is temporary. it simply can't be avoided. please stop fighting yourself...it's just 👏 not 👏 worth it.

It's also stretch marks, cellulite, loose skin & skin folds / rolls.

For me, when I was at my leanest, I still had the cellulite, stretch marks, etc, except I lacked these life-giving things:
💫 the flexibility I have now with food
💫 listening to my cravings
💫 dining out with friends
💫 getting ice cream on a hot day
💫 treating my body well & being physically / mentally fit but also enjoying my life without restriction!

To love
To connect
To adventure
To laugh
To learn
To evolve
(etc)

You are NOT here to simply look & be perfect, whatever that is.

So please, don't focus on what other people's bodies look like or what they may think of yours. Do focus on the things you like about yourself. Each day, say one thing that you like about yourself (it doesn't have to be anything to do with your outward appearance). Focus on your accomplishments that have to do with who you are as a person. Understand that what we see in print, on the television and on our phones have mostly been altered to perfection, not everything is at it seems. No one is “perfect” so embrace the fact that we as humans have our flaws, and love those things that make you unique. Don't wait for who you “could be” in order to love yourself. You're wonderful, right now.

So why bother. Literally. Why bother with the constant suffering if it changes nothing about how you feel. Eat. Eating fuels your brain. It fuels your cells to do their cellular job. If youre trying to survive on nothing you will feel like trash emotionally and physically. Why are you so fucking depressed??? Cuz your brain cant take the bullshit. Any brain surviving on XXX will % be a very upset brain. You cant Happy yourself out of that. You dont have the energy to do that. Fucking eat.

A healthy brain doesnt obsess over sizes and numbers. Its not that simple yes it is. Eat. Force your Ed to shut the fuck up. Cry if you need. Scream if you need. But just fucking eat. Your emotional well being, physical wellbeing, and mental health will all improve as you begin actually feeding your brain and body. Duh. Fucking duh. I absolutely see where you're coming from, and being where you're supposed to be physically works wonders on your mind - but in order to really let go of a sick body, you'll need more than just nutritional restoration. I knew I had to eat enough to keep my body alive for years, but the lack of resources for my mindset just invalidated the hell out of me and kept me sicker. You can't recover without taking care of the physical aspect first, but that can only go so far without needing mental help to cope with all of that.If I'm taking your post too literally, I apologize.
I definitely think getting therapy cannot be ignored in recovery. Absolutely people need mental help to get better. Its the physical part a lot of people tend to slack on. Just therapy isnt enough. You cant heal unless you work on both your brain and your body.

(My case at least) Answer: i feel u tho /: my last bad lapse i went about … ehh i cant remember - months barely eating and i was on the brink of dysfunction, had no idea what to eat or how, couldnt find the motivation. my dad actually offered to meal prep for me every day, just so i could get something in me. they were super small portions (“safe” if u will) and at first i wouldnt always finish everything bc my stomach was so shrunken.  itd be like a small handful of grapes, small handful of almonds, a protein bar or a piece of dark chocolate, and a small hunk of bread & pb to dip.. just small amounts of easy digestible shit i could get down without having to think about it or make any decisions about preferences. eventually i got some energy back after refeeding for a few weeks and i was able to prepare all my snack box stuff on my own and eventually i started cooking again and now i cool regular bomb ass meals and a lotof stuff is from scratch. im pretty quick n efficient and i can survive now, i dont even know how i was scraping by previous to that. you just work your way up there. whatever your body can physically do. when you're recovering from an eating disorder you're “not normal” by default so dont worry about normal portions. “normal portions” in america are often grandiose n huge n exagerrated so dont pay attn to nothin but what ur body tells you!! you have to simultaneously push yourself without pushing yourself too much. if u dont have the means or motivation to see a nutritionist (a nutritionist was relatively helpful in helping me get past bulimia) they arent necessary if ur rly focused on getting better. but then again sometimes u absolutely need somebody to intervene. its ok to ask for help. let it be known that ive basically always been forced at the end of my ropes to get help bc i break down noticeably n everyone can tell but i personally SUCK at asking for help (#hypocrate) but looking back its like… dude why waste your life and time. people r willing to help n often times they wanna help. theres a lot of good information on youtube and google about food n feelings n portions if ur not rly sure what ur tryna do. dont feel pathetic for bein afflicted mate, if you're aware of a problem you're already a step into tackling it thats how i look at it so y…ea. sorry for the longwinded response its hard for me togive str fwd answers hopefully that got some sort of gist across

Doc ID: 23413, distribution: 0.5462991692809371 ; Question: I was on a diet for a long time and nothing happened weight wise. As result, I am probably developing an eating disorder. I am still able to mostly eat what I want but also alter between binging and outright skipping meals. My psychologist suggested eating something every three hours but that just makes me feel like I'm over eating by a huge amount as I seem to be unable to control my portion size : every few hours isnt bad. That doesnt mean you have to eat a meal every few hours, you could literally have a piece of fruit or some pretzels in between meals. Sometimes i get extra hungry and eat like  meals a day. Who cares.  Just munching isnt bad. Some days i have  full meals. Some days i sleep in and just graze on snacks all day long. Like who cares. My body will handle it. Yes some medications have an effect on appetite. You can always talk with your medical team about it and see what they suggest. Sometimes i cant tell if im hungry and some times i cant tell if im full. Thats just how it be. Finding a routine can be helpful. Breakfast, snacky, lunch, snacky, dinner. Maybe another snack at night if you feel like it because why not. Eating with other people can be helpful, i tend to go werewolf when i eat alone. With pals i feel more relaxed and less likely to tie my mental and emotional state with my eating. Bro(and/or sis) never be afraid to speak up about these issues. Ask questions. Talk about concerns. To your family, your friends, your doctors, people who can be there with you in person to help. Literally no reason to face this alone. At all. Maybe consider writing your thoughts and feelings in a journal and tracking whats going on in your life and in your head when you have bad food days. Thats a good first step. You can use that as a guide to talk to a professional about whats happening. Or just to talk to a trusted family member (someone old enough to actually help you)If you feel a need to use behaviors “i want to skip meals” “i want to binge eat” etc, ask yourself .. Why?Work on fixing the “why” and then you wont have the need to use behaviors. The sooner you work on yourself the better. Take care!!!! Good luck! Reach out to others!!! Hit me up if you ever need. Edit: i thought of this after hitting send. You can try those plates that have the dividers in them to help with eyeballing portion sizes.

Doc ID: 6256, distribution: 0.6756847392335479 ; Eric Dorsa, a Recovery Ambassador Council member at @eatingrecovery, shares how he reclaimed power from his Eating Disorder:⁣
⁣
"I used to think that recovery was getting to a place in my life where I was no longer engaging in behaviors. I believed it to be the moment when I would love my body no matter what, and I would be happy and bullet proof and a self-help guru.⁣
⁣
I believed that recovery was this magical place where I would want “it” all the time and I could see past all the pain and lies and trauma and be in the truth all the time. Believe me when I say this; I so wish at many times in my life that this was true. I wish this is what recovery looked like because at times, life in recovery is so painful.⁣
⁣
It is brutally honest and asks you to be brave. It is having to do things that have never been done before. It asks you to be the only one standing on the stage in a spotlight. It asks you to name every fear out loud to a complete stranger.⁣
⁣
On the other side of this journey that is never done is your freedom, your wisdom, you. On the other side of this pain is your truth! It is your superpower.⁣
⁣
You see, I needed every minute of my journey to realize that I get to live life now. And that is the most vulnerable thing I can do. I get to be me now, all of me if I want to. And believe me, I want nothing more." - @fkdrag

tip for these— use a chopped chocolate bar as opposed to chocolate chips. i can't explain how much this elevates the eating experience but trust me, it's a game changer. hope you love these as much as we do :)

toast your banana bread.

leave it to me to bake up a fresh loaf before finding out that today is a national banana bread holiday 👀 i love where my head is at hahaha

that being said, what better day than today to save this recipe and make it for later? i've tried hundreds of gluten free banana bread recipes over the years but i always come back to this one. i've never met a texture more perfect than this one!

and of course, once it's all baked up and cooled, you need to toss a thick slice in the toaster until golden brown, then top with some butter and chocolate chunks. i really can't emphasize enough how dreamy and satisfying each bite is… wow. hope you try it out for yourself!

recipe for the loaf is below!

classic gluten-free banana bread

preheat oven to F and prepare a loaf pan.

wet ingredients:

-  large ripe bananas, mashed
- / cup olive oil 
-  eggs 
- / cup coconut syrup 
- splash of vanilla

dry ingredients:

-  cups gluten-free flour
- pinch each of sea salt, baking powder, and cinnamon 

mix the wet ingredients together until well-combined. in a separate bowl, do the same for the dry ingredients. add the dry mixture to the wet and fold until uniform. i stirred through about / cup candied pecans at the last minute :) transfer batter to the prepared loaf pan and bake for - minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. let cool completely before slicing or icing. i iced mine with  cup powdered sugar mixed with  tbsp milk until a glaze formed, then poured over the top and let set in the fridge before slicing.

once my chickpea cookie dough bars went viral i knew i had to recreate them in some way! these muffins come together so easily— literally just toss everything in a blender, pour out the batter, and wait for them to bake. they're flourless and can easily be made high protein too, if that's your thing.

and because it'll come up right away: I PROMISE you can't taste the chickpeas :')

simple yet decadent recipes are my staple, and this one might just be in my top ... but don't just take my word for it. recipe below so you can try it yourself!

-ingredient flourless chickpea cookie dough muffins 

ingredients:

-  can (. oz) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
-  eggs
- / cup creamy salted peanut butter 
- / cup maple syrup
- pinch each of sea salt and baking powder
- chocolate chips/chopped chocolate for mixing in (save for the end)

directions:

preheat oven to  and prepare a muffin tin. add all of the ingredients to a blender (except chocolate) and blend until a thick, uniform batter forms. will be very thick but this is fine! stir through the chocolate by hand and transfer dough to the brownie tin. bake for - minutes or until golden brown. i let mine cool completely in the fridge for an hour or two before enjoying. you can heat the bars up in the microwave if you'd like to eat them warm, but they're delicious cold too :)  
*note: feel free to add a scoop of vanilla protein powder if you'd like to kick up the protein a bit!

a small hack that will absolutely change your life hahaha. the only way i'm eating banana bread now on is to toast up a thick, fresh slice in the toaster for - minutes or until golden brown. while the slice is still hot, add some butter and a handful of chocolate chips and let everything melt/swirl together. 

i really can't emphasize enough how cozy and nourishing this way of eating banana bread is. as if banana bread wasn't perfect on it's own, the only thing that could possibly make it better obviously had to be melted butter and warm chocolate.

Topic 3 : 
top terms: therapy, therapist, talking, talk, felt, feel, session, over, her, shes
Doc ID: 12113, distribution: 0.0847319814688804 ; mirithebrave:  Also - screw it - while we're talking about treatment experiences, here's my review of Renfrew (the Brentwood, TN location). Prepare yourselves, it's bad. This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).  A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.  On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode. I'm sure she was great therapist and very skilled at her job, but because of my religious PTSD, my brain coded her as unsafe and I was unable to talk to her or open up.  I told them I couldn't work with her - I tried to advocate for myself because I know my brain. The psychiatric provider told me I needed to learn to work through that and that that was the actual issue, that I needed to learn to work with Christian therapists. SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT after I had just said that I grew up in a Christian cult and have PTSD from that. My issue was not the harm they caused, but being unable to work with Christian therapists… Well about  weeks into my stay, I have a breakdown because I've been off my antidepressants for weeks and no one has been monitoring my meds. I asked - no, BEGGED, to talk to someone because I was feeling desperate. The therapist on site told me that “maybe now just isn't the best time for treatment” and maybe I needed to hit rock bottom first. I walked away feeling even more desperate.  The entire time when I was struggling with trauma symptoms (dissociating a lot, having panic attacks) I was told that I was being avoidant and resistant and just wasn't motivated enough, even though I was giving it all I had.  A friend of mine, another patient, was literally sent to a room by herself when she couldn't finish a meal, even though that replicated traumatic punishments she had as a child (she told me all of this and I told her if they made her do it again I would come sit with her so she wouldn't be alone).  They don't teach coping skills either? Everything is labeled avoidance (music, writing, any “healthy” coping skills is avoidance unless you just sit and feel the emotion). That may sound innocent enough until you bring trauma into the equation, in which just “sitting with” the traumatic emotions / thoughts is not how you heal and in fact may be re-traumatizing.  I was also constantly made to feel like I was the problem. The approach was extremely punitive. One of the head dietitians, who was not on my team, threatened on my second to last day that if I didn't finish a meal, they might discharge me early. I told her I was about to discharge in two days, and she said, “Well, we might make it tomorrow instead.” I was already anxious enough, and I don't respond well to ultimatums or threats (who does?), which were really common there. All of that to say: they are NOT equipped to treat trauma, no matter what they advertise.  EDITED to add: I've written reviews on Yelp and Google, if you want to “like” them ;)  
 I found my old treatment plans from Renfrew: “client presents with an avoidance of vulnerable emotions; is quick to anger to feel a sense of power”   okay. I have PTSD; avoidance is LITERALLY one of the diagnostic criteria for that. As for anger, I wasn't being heard & was shamed at every turn for trauma responses. My anger was self-protection & survival. Any clinician worth their salt would approach that with compassion. oh, but this next part: “Client endorses trauma response to one staff member she has “coded” as unsafe.”  Yeah, see my brain did not *choose* to code this staff membee as unsafe. She was connected to things associated with my trauma. That was mocked. Anyway, fuck Renfrew.

Doc ID: 14457, distribution: 0.4436851478103919 ; Question: Hi! I was wondering if I could have your thoughts. Something weird is happening with me and my therapist - while I'm sat a few minutes in the car decompressing after I see her leave the building, running to her car and driving off. It sounds ridiculous but I find it very strange that she is able to leave so quickly and I know it's just her job but it's like she's desperate to leave and is putting on her coat as soon as I close the door. Idk there's just something a bit upsetting about it I know I'm being ridiculous!   Answer: You're not being ridiculous. I think I might feel similarly. Could you mention to your therapist about how you feel? These things often tend to bother us until we bring them into the light and talk about them. In the absence of knowing, our brains make up stories to fill in the explanations. It's really useful to find out whether these stories are true because that helps us think more flexibly about other situations too.I noticed that my therapist was sometimes on WhatsApp  or  minutes after my session ended, and it really bothered me because it felt like she couldn't wait to jump on her phone as soon as she was done with me. (In hindsight, it was probably absolutely reasonable but in the moment I was like WHAAAT why aren't you sitting still considering all the profound things I've just said!) I mentioned it in session once and she was really reassuring, and now it's just become a non issue that doesn't bother me at all. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15425, distribution: 0.6239828904112195 ; I had a really positive therapy session yesterday and T said she was really proud of me. She also said she had supervision today and now she was excited to have something really good (my progress) to share. I have mixed feelings about that. On the surface I'm happy that she can share how well I'm doing and that I know % it is down to her help that I'm in this place, so I'm really happy and pleased for her to take that to supervision. On the other hand though, did that mean that she didn't have anything good to share before this? Was she going to go to supervision and rack her brains for what to say…. “Uh yeah Faith is still having the same old same old conversations with me about eating cake” and her supervisor would be like “Come on T, you have to move her through that”  I'm probably overthinking. I hope her supervisor was happy too and told T what a good job she was doing and that all the struggles with me were worth it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16464, distribution: 0.716356680923532 ; Therapy .. // connection and enmeshment  After we had talked through the whole “did you really mean to say it was emotional abuse?” issue and T had confirmed that yes, she did believe it was that, we got onto talking about the Christmas break. My adult self knows that the next two weeks over Christmas and New Year will go super fast and I will not miss therapy particularly. I'm securely attached enough to T that I can feel the connection with her even when I don't see her, plus I have little strategies to boost that connected feeling such as I can look on WhatsApp and see when she was last online, and I can read her past messages to me, and I have the bowl she made me (which I dithered over bringing away with me but didn't in the end - I didn't want to have to explain it to anyone else who saw it and I was also worried it might get damaged in transit). T asked me how it felt going back to stay at my parents house after everything we'd just talked about. I thought about it. “I think…. uh I think I will feel a bit more separate from them. And a bit more adult”. T and I have talked recently about my mum and I being quite enmeshed. Not in the typical way I would think of enmeshed as being, but more in a way of me continually trying to align my thoughts and beliefs alongside hers. A sort of virtual enmeshment maybe. Now I'm facing the reality that there was emotional abuse going on and my mum did not stop it.  My parents are really coming off their pedestal as I realise more and more not only were they not perfect but they actually got some things very wrong. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14490, distribution: 0.18910312919354713 ; Therapy .. // slowly unfreezing  I sat frozen for some time. It probably wasn't very long but I lost any sense of time. I was not making eye contact with T but I was facing the screen enough that I could see her when she shifted position. I become very aware of my own blinking when I'm frozen like this, I guess my eyelids are the only part of me that moves. It's not going to be a very accurate account of what happened from here on because it's a bit hazy and I'm piecing it together from snatches of memory. T may or may not have asked me what I was thinking, but eventually I managed to rouse out of my frozen state enough to say “My mind is all blank”. T said “Mmm yes, you're having a freeze response, like in fight flight or freeze. Would you agree?” I nodded.  “Some part of you feels like it's not safe, what I just said?” she continued. I nodded again. Once I've moved out of the totally involuntary freeze state, it's hard to force myself to unfreeze further. Most of my brain wants to stay there, it doesn't want to make the effort to come back to the present. I have to really work to make myself focus and speak.  I don't know what got said in what order after this. T said if you keep someone dependent on you when it's not needed, then that's abuse, not comfort. I'm not sure why she said that, other than she's trying to tell me I need to be less dependent. Except I think I *am* less dependent than I have been, so I don't get it. And I'm not going to stop depending on her entirely because I'm paying her to be my therapist and I'm not going to turn down her support while it's still there. I don't want to look back when she's not my therapist any more and wish I'd made full use of her support when I had it. T mentioned that I had brought up ending therapy before, and so she knew I had thought about it. I dredged some words out of the back of my brain and muttered “I don't actually want to end therapy after all….. I'm just going to stay forever and ever.”  T said “That's very brave of you to say that. Thankyou for being brave enough to say that.” I flickered my eyes over to make eye contact and then looked away again. T said “There might be a bit of a problem with staying in therapy forever with our ages, as we both get older.” I felt like I didn't care about that. I don't have a solution to it but I don't need a solution right now. Right now I am here in therapy and that's where I'm staying.

I hope you will feel ok through her vacation week with that extra reassurance from her. Take care x

I was messaging with my sister about it, because it was difficult to speak about it to my local friends for various reasons.  After texts back and forward, my sister sent me a message that said “I think that whilst we had a very happy and settled childhood, I don't think our parents were very communicative about the 'real world'” and then a specific example. I know my sister doesn't think every moment of our childhood was happy because we have spoken before of things that occurred in our household that she knew didn't happen in her friends houses. But 'happy and settled' is still the story we tell each other. T knows it's not completely true too. I still want to believe it's true, but I know we have spoken of things in therapy that T would not class as happy. When I think of them outside of myself, I would not class them as happy either.  I spoke about how many conversations with us my mum must have avoided because they were too upsetting for her and she couldn't face them. I'm reminded of my comment from the previous week that it felt like sometimes she emotionally abandoned us.  I said I felt angry with my mum. Even when I've been struggling in some of the situations I find most difficult, when it feels like I'm falling in a black hole and I can't get grounded, even then I manage to pull it together for my children, no matter how much it costs me afterwards. So I feel angry that my mum couldn't do the same for us. These feelings are new to me. I've been very aligned to my mum all my life. I take on her feelings, thoughts and opinions. T thinks I did this partly because I needed her as my comforter against my dad's anger. I'd like to write a nice wrapping up of the session but I think what happened was we ran out of time and we just left it all where it was and took the last  minutes to unwind and ground back in the present. Now I can't emotionally connect back with it to write about it the way I usually do, so this will have to do. It has actually been really helpful to write this out because it has provided some connection back with the session.

I had things I wanted to talk about that I'd been holding all week, and I had been anticipating the sense of comfort and relief that would come from sinking in to the session and sharing them with my therapist.  We logged into Skype as usual and the connection was poor, so T immediately suggested she send me a Zoom invite. I think she's trying to change me over to Zoom, because this isn't the first time she's mentioned it. I'm sure it's fine, I'm just ridiculously resistant to change and I'm like “Noooo you live in my Skype app don't leave”. But anyway, Skype was misbehaving so we Zoomed instead and it was fine. I may even come to like it better because T has to send me the Zoom invite beforehand so it's like a call to therapy and that's quite nice. I said to T that I was super stressed because the builders next door were hammering away right behind the wall I was sitting in front of. I said I was worried it would be distracting for her or she wouldn't be able to hear me, and she said not to worry about her, she could hear me fine and if it got difficult she would put her earphones in, which makes it easier to hear voices. So far so good. I had my notebook next to me with a few notes of what I wanted to talk about this session, and I thought from the fact that T and I had also had a brief text exchange this week - where I had sent T my mum's Facebook post and a little comment, and she had replied “you are you and you are absolutely fine just as you are” - maybe she would be alert to the fact that I might need to talk about that.  Anyway, it seemed T had her own agenda.

T said she would always be honest and real with me. She said something else around that, but that's the bit I heard. Then she said let's talk about something lighter for a few minutes, how are your girls feeling about going back to school?  I wasn't ready to go up there yet though, I was still stuck on the honest and real. I stared into space for a few moments and then said “Will you always be honest and real?” I just wanted her to say, yes she would. I felt quite emotional thinking about being able to rely on what she said and not have to read between the lines. As a child, I was exceedingly good at reading between the lines and working out what was not being said but that I needed to know. T got sidetracked and started rambling about well she would try to be but might not be able to be because she's only human and etc etc. She went on for a couple of minutes, and then looked at me and asked “Is that what you meant?”  I shook my head, because it was so far from what I meant.  T smiled and said “Ahh well maybe we will have to revisit it next session because I don't think we have time now”, and I shrugged and said “Yeah…. maybe - but maybe it doesn't really matter.” I don't know whether I'll bring it up again next session or not.

Doc ID: 15566, distribution: 0.6449622131687822 ; Moving forwards in therapy  Therapy yesterday was really good. I've had a run of good sessions recently, no ruptures for ages. I wonder if it's because I've built so much trust in T now that I can tell her in session, when it happens, if something isn't right or isn't helpful, and we can alter course immediately to get back on track.  I'm able to talk more fluently in session and although we still have pauses, they're mostly not caused by my brain shutting down, they're more constructive thinking pauses. It's taken years of work to get to this point (I'm sure other therapy clients get there faster… I feel like I've been very slow, although I can also have compassion for myself and understand why that is, so I'm not blaming myself. It is what it is). I think we're doing good work together at the moment. I feel like I'm moving through stuff. Some years ago, T likened our position in therapy at that time to being on a rollercoaster, but just sitting at the top of the track, moving back and forth…. not rolling backwards but not moving forwards either. At the time, she said it's like we're sitting up there, just waiting… waiting…. to set off forwards again.  I think I felt a bit unhappy with her analogy when she said it because it felt like she was saying we were stuck, and I didn't feel like I was stuck. There was lots going on in my head, rearranging of thoughts, processing stuff, but it was probably stuff she didn't see because I was still struggling to share everything I was thinking. Eventually I can't remember exactly what happened, but there was a session where all my internal building of momentum finally reached a tipping point and we started to move forward again. I think soon after that, T said we were “hurtling along”.  I imagine that's quite normal in therapy, periods of not much progress seeming to happen, and then periods of really fast growth. It's not always an exact steady process. I feel like I'm in a time of fast growth again at the moment. Lots of little insights. Learning things in particular situations that I think I will be able to apply to broader situations in the future. Accepting my attachment to T and my feelings towards her as being ok and healthy and necessary to enable me to do the work I need to do. Learning to ask for and accept things from her.  It all feels good. We haven't spoken again about her retiring, so I think that means the date is still over a year away. I'm glad about that.

And then I struggle again at the end to get back out of the therapy space. I only really registered that it's difficult both ways last session. I think my therapist thinks I am more aware of the time than I am. I often find I glance at the clock about halfway through the session, but then I get deeper into things and I don't look at it again. At the end of last week's session, I was talking about something deep, and then paused to think and then suddenly T was saying “so how about before we end, let's talk about something lighter… how about you tell me about what you've been up to with your family in lockdown”. I was a bit taken aback by the sudden transition from therapy material to surface stuff, and I struggled to find my way out of my head back into the world again. I often feel like I'm far away and the jump back into present time is too hard. I tried to wrestle myself back up to the surface, but in the end I just said to T, “I don't like it when you do that!” She took that on board and asked me how I would rather end things. “Would you rather just keep on talking about deep things right until the last moment?”  “Noooo…. it just feels like too much of a jump though. Too sudden.” I need her to wrap up what we're talking about a bit more, even if it's just saying that we'll carry on talking about it next week but we need to start bringing things to a close now. I know I am bad at ending on time. I never take responsibility for it. If T doesn't end the session, I just keep talking. I don't like the ending, having to leave and not see her for another week. She does have to gently push me out a little bit at the end. She usually does it by talking about scheduling for my next session, and at that point I will take it as my cue to end. But until she moves into that, I figure she's still willing to sit there and be with me so I just keep going.

Doc ID: 17075, distribution: 0.47627059266405336 ; Letter to my mum   At some point after my last therapy session two weeks ago, I had the idea to write a letter to my mum. Not one that I would ever plan to send to her, but I've been talking about my past relationship with her for a few weeks in therapy now and writing her a letter seemed a way maybe of sorting my feelings out a bit. A week ago when I was away for a night on my own with the baby, I finally had the chance to write the letter. It was amazingly difficult to find a couple of hours of peace and quiet to immerse myself in the letter writing, so when I had the prospect of that whole evening to myself, I knew I had to seize the moment. I hand wrote it because I felt that it would be more natural and the words would flow more authentically that way. Typing is good for lots of things because you can go back and rephrase your sentence and edit as you go, but I wanted this letter to just flow as it came out on to the paper.  While I was writing it, I felt so so grateful to T for making me feel safe enough to risk looking back at things without the “it was all perfect” filter on. Even while I was thinking what to write, I knew I was going to share the letter with T and that she would and could be able to contain everything I wrote and whatever it stirred up. After I finished it, I shut the notebook up and I haven't really had chance to look back at it since then. However now I have therapy tomorrow and I have to decide whether to tell T about it in advance or even email it to her so she can have it printed out. I think it might be too long to get through all in one session and if she can see it written down she will be able to follow along with what I'm reading and refer back to it. In preparation for that, when H went out for a bike ride this evening, I took advantage of the peace to type it all up so it's on my iPad now if I do decide to send it. I might destroy the handwritten version very soon because I don't want it to be found and read by anyone else.

Suddenly I need to tell her I am only getting through this by holding on to the thought of her. If I pause here for too long, she will speak again and end the session, thinking I'm just struggling with ending. So I say all in a rush, “Umm so, when I was writing the letter, I was thinking I would show it to you…. and knowing you would see it with me - well that was the only thing that made it feel safe enough to write…” “Hmm, yes… Am I pushing you too hard?” I don't know where T makes that connection from. Maybe she has more overview of the whole session than me. I just know I'm freaking out because this is all a lot to hold and it makes me want to grab her and hold on tightly and ask repeatedly, will it be ok? “No but it just… it just makes me feel like I need you a lot…” I'm looking down at my fingers through this whole conversation. I have shame over feeling like this, even though I know it's ok to need T and she is ok with it. “Are you saying you might want to text me at the weekend?” (This weekend is significant because we have been talking about my relationship with my mum and doing things differently, and I'm about to go and spend the weekend with her.) I shrug. “I don't know…. I want to text you all the time…. even last night, even when I knew I was seeing you this morning…”   “Ok…well it's ok if you want to text me at the weekend. That's fine with me” I look up and give T a little smile. She's got this. I feel held and contained and all those other slightly weird therapy concepts that seem to make sense when you're in the middle of them. “I'll see you on Tuesday. Take care Faith”

Doc ID: 15058, distribution: 0.2657954430403665 ; Therapy .. // perspectives   T asked me how things were for d now she is temporarily home from university, so we chatted about that. T asked me if it brought things up for me, talking about d leaving home and going to university. I said I found myself thinking that d was so young, only just turned , to be trying to cope with university in the time of Covid. And then I caught myself thinking that by d's age, I'd been at university coping for a year and a bit - albeit not with Covid as well. T asked me what feelings it brought up. I paused. This is all a valid thing for us to talk about, but I'm not ready to move on to university years yet. I'm still processing the primary school years. This has happened before, T starts to take the conversation in a different direction to where I thought it was going to go. One time after I'd gone along with her line of questions and then got upset about using the time time to talk about that and her not picking up what we'd been talking about the previous session, she said to me “Faith this is your time, you can choose what we talk about”. It was empowering.  I learnt that I can redirect the conversation to what I want to talk about. For a people pleaser like me, who used to be too scared to state my own wants because I always felt like other peoples mattered more, this has been such an important lesson. So I said, “Could we come back to this topic later?”  T nodded, “Of course… where would you like to go?” She always gives me a positive experience of expressing my own wants and needs. I love that.  I said something about going back to what we were talking about last session. I briefly got stuck inside my head, phrasing and rephrasing what to say. “Um… so I've been thinking about what we were talking about - about primary school. It feels hard to stay with this topic though… part of me just wants to shut it down and say, ah never mind, we've talked about it enough. It was all a long time ago.”  “So part of you wants to shut it down… that sounds like there's another part that wants to talk about it?” “Yeah, part of me does want to talk about it. Like from a  year old perspective, there's bits of it that are hugely important. But from an adult perspective, those same things don't seem to really matter. I kind of go back and forth between those two perspectives.”

Doc ID: 14910, distribution: 0.2853846460758787 ; Therapy .. // frightened  After we'd said our hellos, T used one of her usual opening lines and asked me if I had a list to work through or were we just going to talk and see where the session led us? I said I had some stuff written down. We both started to talk at the same time and she stopped herself and said “I'll let you go where you were going.” I said “Last week's session… it was difficult to speak because I still find it hard to believe myself, and there's a big part of me that still thinks that really you think I'm just making a fuss about nothing and I'm being overdramatic…. it's hard to believe myself and that's why I want to hear it from you, about my childhood, because I think I might believe it more if you tell me it.” T recapped some of the things we have talked about about my childhood, and that she doesn't think I'm being overdramatic. She said my dads anger must have been very frightening, especially think about the size of an adult compared to a child, add in anger, she said no wonder it felt frightening. She said that she knows my dad still makes me cry now in my forties, and that is evidence for me, how my body reacts even now as an adult, its evidence that it was very frightened as a child. I said “I actually don't know how I survived it as a child. Like now, I can just about cope with the anxiety of a few days with my parents. But as a child I had nowhere to go, I don't know how I coped.” T said “You coped in the only way you had an option to, which was to shut it all off, all the feelings. Separate them from yourself. Now you have let your feelings back in and become aware of them and that's why you find it so much more difficult being around your dad now.”

The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 16374, distribution: 0.05503794332952203 ; Ok so update on d and the autism question. In the weeks before Christmas, I was really wondering whether we should look into getting d assessed for ASD. She is struggling with *something* at school enough that school have agreed to look into doing a managed move to another school. The something is probably friendship group related but it's hard to pin down exactly what. She takes up quite a lot of the pastoral/well-being staff's time at school. It's a large school and they don't have the time they need to attend to everyone, but in d's mind, if they can't make time for her or they aren't there at a time when they've said they will be, they're horrible people. It's very black and white for her. She hates them and says they don't care about her. She can't seem to think that there might be a hundred reasons why they got called away or weren't available at the moment. I've tried to talk that through with her but she refuses to consider the shades of grey. It was all making her quite unhappy and coming to a head and that's why I started wondering whether we should look into an ASD diagnosis. (For any new followers, there's more back story and it's been something I've been wondering about for years now and other people have mentioned occasionally. So it's not just based on these couple of events) But then I started wondering whether it would do more harm than good. Obviously I couldn't take d for an assessment without explaining to her what it was for, and she would have to agree to do the assessment, or even just to get the referral for the assessment. And I am still not sure whether it would be more harmful than helpful to suggest to her she has ASD. She knows kids at school with ASD diagnoses, and their behaviour is more classic extreme autism - very different to hers - so I think it might upset her for me to suggest it. That's why I asked about what age people think is optimal to be diagnosed in their own experience. I know that these days lots of adult women are being diagnosed, but I think it's different as an adult and when you are maybe seeking a way to understand yourself. d does not want to be different at all.  So where things are now is that it's all on hold again - until the next crisis, at least. We are waiting to hear back from the other school as to whether they are willing to create a space for d to move there. I watch d and sometimes I still think her behaviours are just normal teenage stuff. She is isolating less and joining in with the family a little more and with less complaints, which I'm happy about. I'm still trying to find the right balance between leaving her in peace but not letting her pull away too much, however things have been good between us since Christmas. Maybe it's the positive effect of therapy as well. I haven't spoken to her therapist about the ASD possibility. People who don't know her that well look at me like I'm mad when I mention it. It's only the people who've seen her a lot that start to join up some dots. Anyway, the therapist might be my next line of enquiry, if I do get concerned again.  So for now, just watching and waiting and seeing how things go.

It gives me all these opportunities to prepare her emotionally for the upheaval in ways that my parents never did for me. This evening she has been calculating her budget and talking about getting a job to and also doing some volunteering. I said they were great ideas and definitely if she has the capacity and wants to, she could go for it. But I said don't underestimate the enotional and physical energy required to settle in when you move to a new city and start a new course and meet new people and have to look after yourself for the first time. I said she might find that at first just doing that is quite enough and in that case not to put pressure on herself to do anything extra for a while. The other night I got a chance to talk to her about how she will have some days where she just feels really wobbly and like it's all too much and she doesn't want to do it. And when those days come, just know that it's really normal to feel that way and it will pass, like maybe you just have to see that day out and then go to bed and when you wake up the next morning you'll feel more positive. I think she's going to do just fine at university and will probably thrive on the independence once she gets settled in, but it can never harm to give her some tools so she knows that if she has bad days, she can get through them.

Anyway, I managed to be in front of the laptop and ready at , so that was a start. Knowing I'm paying almost £ per minute for therapy is a good motivator to haul my brain into gear and make good use of the session time. T asked me if I had a list to talk about today, and I said I just had 'faulty thought patterns' which was leftover from last weeks list. I said “I have this thing which I am struggling with, but every time I try and explain it to you, I don't seem to be able to explain it very well and it just ends up feeling a bit frustrating.” T said that maybe it's because she tries to rescue me and find solutions and what I really need is her just to hear me. I nodded. You can't find a solution to a problem unless you properly understand what the issue is to begin with. The issue is basically that I go to a coffee shop and on the way, I think I would like to have cake of some sort while I'm there…. or in previous variations on the theme, I think I would like to have a fancy drink rather than a basic americano. Then I get to the coffee shop and I stand in the queue and I suddenly think why am I having cake? (or fancy drink), think of all that excess, why not just stick to the basic meal plan, I don't need these extras. And I end up leaving with just the americano after all. I know this sounds quite minor but it spills over into other areas of life and it feels like an aspect of my life where the eating disorder is still in control and that really frustrates me. T explored it a bit with me. I said that the faulty thought patterns is that it's all-or-nothing. [redacted a bit of explicit talk of behaviours] I said I know there's diets that are like : where you stick to the plan % of the time and eat what you like the other %…. “But I just think, well why not stick to the plan % of the time?” That genuinely really puzzles me. Why would you deliberately do something at less than %? I think if I could find way to fix this thinking, then I would have cracked this whole dilemma. In the coffee shop, I end up feeling like a disappointed child who's had something promised to her and then had it taken away at the last minute. Which I don't think is a feeling from childhood, because I don't think that happened to me very often. My dad over-indulged us and my mum didn't really indulge us, but neither of them promised stuff and then didn't follow through on it. T asked me if I thought the all-or-nothing thinking came from childhood, could I remember any incidences of it? Then she retracted the question because we only had a few minutes left. Then she asked what my gut reaction to her question was, did I think yes or no. She said maybe it wasn't from childhood, maybe it was something I had constructed as an adult. Now I've had time to reflect, I don't think it's from childhood particularly. The cake in coffee shops and being unable to eat sweet snacks at home without chewing and spitting both feel like different faces of the same issue. So if I could crack it from one aspect, it would bring freedom in lots of areas. We didn't come up with any answers this week but we will keep thinking about it next week.

It's a benefit of doing therapy over Skype, being able to get cosy and settled before my session starts. T jumped right in with “So - here we are again. Where to today?” I could ask her for more small talk to ease in and I'm sure she'd go with it, but in the end I still have to start talking about the therapy things.  “Uh…so… last week you mentioned retiring… and I was wondering…. if that was a definite plan …uh…. or just a thing that will happen sometime in the future….?” T replied that she didn't have a plan to retire right now, and that she didn't have any particular timings in mind for retirement. She said if I'd asked her a year ago, she would have no plans to retire, but this year, she feels a bit different. I didn't ask her why or what made her feel different. She continued to say that what she thought she'd do eventually would be stop taking on new clients and keep working with the ones she had until they were ready to finish. “But no Faith, I'm not retiring any time soon.” I sat quietly listening to her explanations. I did my best to make eye contact and 'reach for the connection'. T finished talking and I sat thinking about what she'd said. It felt a bit confusing. Last week she'd brought up retirement and it felt like she was trying to reality-check me about having to end sooner or later. And now she's telling me that she doesn't have any times in mind to retire and even when she does, she will keep her current clients. Then T said “but you brought up last week that you had been thinking about ending therapy…”

We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow.

I find it very difficult to talk about her in therapy and be able to reflect on our relationship past and present at a period of time like this when I see her so much. However I won't see her for a while now so I can try and be more objective again. For anyone reading this, remember I have all the good things about my relationship with my mum safe in an imaginary box.  While we were away this weekend, two things struck me. First, I noticed how judgemental my mum can be. Talking about an old friend she stayed with recently, she makes statements like “Oh she just needs to….” “She should do….” and “If only she would…”, all of which imply that my mum knows the one and only way to navigate life and if everyone was just the same as her, they would be much happier. Something about this is tugging at me. I think she said similar things all through my childhood, only I didn't recognise it as being judgemental or overcritical, because I just thought my mum knew best. I didn't realise her words were opinion, because I accepted them as facts. I think the eating disorder voice in my head says similar things, states opinions as facts. “You'll be much happier if…” The second thing that happened was as we were coming home, our flight got in much earlier than expected so my mum and sister said they would catch an earlier train. I said I couldn't because my ticket was only booked for one specific train. It turned out my mum and sister had the same type of ticket, but they were planning to hop on board their (separate) trains and just blag. I said I wasn't doing that because it would make me too stressed and anxious. My mum thought I was being ridiculous and spent ages trying to tell me what I needed to do and to convince me that there would be no problem, and even if there was I would just have to get off at the next station.  I pulled a face, and in the end she threw her hands up and said “oh well, you just wait and get the next train then” in a weary frustrated kind of way. My sister said to her “You're not supposed to speak to anxious people like that! You're supposed to say 'I can see you're finding this situation very difficult.'” My mum rolled her eyes and repeated the phrase to me in a sarcastic tone of voice. The frustrating thing is, I know my mum knows how to respond to people with anxiety because she has worked with them in the past. However when it comes to me, she thinks I'm just being pathetic, and if I would just pull myself together and be sensible, I would be fine. I have been anxious all my life but I have learnt to shove it down and just get on with it because my mum has always had this sort of approach. No space or validation for my own feelings, so I never learnt how to deal with the difficult ones. This is what I'm going to talk about in therapy tomorrow.

Doc ID: 14675, distribution: 0.25858472444982455 ; Therapy .. // first session of    We talked a bit about how Christmas had been and how the New Year looks, and T told me about her grandchildren going back to university and I told her about d still being at home and d and d being on home learning now. I said how careful we'd been before Christmas and isolated and got up to see my parents, and she said “But did you isolate when you came back?” and I said No, and T pulled a disapproving face. Ugh that's still bugging me. I mean, it wasn't like we really went anywhere but the girls met a friend each for a walk outside, which didn't feel too unreasonable to me given that I'd made them stay home for so long. Anyway, that kind of ended that conversation, so we sat for a moment and then T said “So, where shall we start today?” I had written a list of things to mention and I just went with the first thing on it, which was that as we'd discussed that I would, I weighed myself while at my parents' house. We don't have scales in our house so I always get a bit obsessed with their scales when I'm there. It is always difficult to say my weight out loud to my therapist (or anyone), but I managed to tell her what it was. It was at the very bottom of the healthy range I maintained through .  I said that it was ironic that in , I weighed myself once a week and that made me focus a lot on what I was eating and exercising, and yet in  I didn't weigh myself at all between February and December, and I ended up weighing less than I did when I was focusing on it. Weird. T asked me how I was feeling in myself, did I have energy, am I warm enough etc and I said yes, generally I was feeling good. There have been a few occasions when I got light headed when I stood up too fast, and that annoys me because I am eating so I don't know why my body is complaining.  T said she thinks we need to stop focusing too much on numbers and weight and bmi and think more about how I am feeling about my body so I can learn to trust that. We discussed how my weight was what I would have predicted if I'd taken a guess based on how my body feels to me. T said “That shows you that you can trust your perception of your body.” My head still craves numbers for security, partly because of past incidents in my teenage years, but I am definitely going to work on trying to trust my perception more.

She asked me if I was ok, because she said I seemed a bit flat. I said no I'm ok. I was suddenly a bit tearful because it felt like she'd said hi so gently, as if she knew it was going to be a tough session, and the quietness in her voice caught me a bit unexpectedly.  “Do you have any things to talk about on your list today?” I shook my head “Ok so shall we talk about this story that you sent me?” I nodded and T pulled across a print out of it she had right there next to her. “How did it feel to write this?” “Uh…. well I didn't set out to write that, what it turned out to be. I sat down to try and put into words something I had been thinking about.” “Ok, what were you trying to write?” “Uh… so at the end of last session, I said [insert a slightly confused and jarbled retelling of the conversation], and I think up till then I'd felt like you were kind of neutral on what went on in my childhood. Like, maybe those things happened but they probably weren't really a big deal. But when you said what you said, I felt like you were on my side and maybe you did think some of the things that happened were wrong….” I tailed off, and T spoke up “Yes, you're right. I do think some of the things were wrong” “Oh. Um so I was thinking about that and trying to put into words something about, uh, so I see families and children who come into foster care, and they generally have similarities in the situations of the families. Like they're often struggling with money, one or both parents not working, relationship breakdown, complicated situations… and things go on at home that I think almost everyone would agree was wrong. And I was thinking I would say it's wrong for those children to be subjected to those things. But it's hard to think that maybe things - not so extreme, but still things - were going on in my family when it was not that sort of situation at all…. So I sat down to write that, but then when I started typing, I wrote that story instead.”

The first one was yesterday, and I spent the whole of that session intending to talk about this but I got derailed by something that happened at the weekend. Then I was frustrated that I had never got round to talking about the letter. T said it was likely an unconscious thing, that having written the letter and splurged all that stuff out, I then needed to avoid it for a while. Anyway, at the end of my usual weekly session I asked for a second session so that I could start to talk about the letter before I saw my mum this weekend. So we managed to schedule this one. 
 “Where shall we start? Do you want to go with the letter…. or what we were talking about yesterday? or something else completely?” [how do therapists drop so easily into therapy mode? I have a therapy mode. I speak in a slower quieter voice and I have one foot in the past and one foot in the present, but it takes me quite a few minutes to get there and I have to give myself permission to drop into it] “I want to talk about the letter.” “Mmm?” “It's hard for me to look at it again. After I wrote it… I wrote it by hand…. then I didn't let myself go back and change any of it.” “But you wanted to?” “Yes because I know bits of it aren't perfect…. they don't say exactly what I wanted them to say… but when I was writing it I just kept going as thoughts came in my mind.” “Right… but you need it to be perfect even though it's just what it is? A letter that's not for anyone else to see?” “Yeah. I just like to know I've expressed myself the best I can. And I feel like it jumps around a bit and maybe things aren't in the best order.” “Well, to me it reads very well. I think it's very coherent. You've expressed yourself clearly.” “Mmm ok. And I know it's not very balanced. Like, I didn't write about the good things about my mum. Because it was getting quite long and I know the good things are safe in the box.” “That's ok, I know there are some great things about your mum and lots of things that you love about her and I'm always holding that in the back of my mind. Those things are safe…  Ok so do you want to go through it from the beginning, or is there a specific part you want to pull out to talk about, or do you want to talk about it some other way?” “No” T laughs. “I'm not sure that was a question that can be answered with no!” “I want to start at the beginning.” (This is how I'd always imagined going through it, so I'm kind of there as to the first couple of paragraphs and what they say. That feels safe so let's start there.)

Doc ID: 16974, distribution: 0.2701551664637846 ; Question: You don't have to go into this if you don't want to, but I'm a newish follower and I was just wondering about the backstory of T's daughter having an ED and how asked me if I remembered some months before when she'd suddenly got very dictator-y over how much I was eating, and it turned out that was when her daughter was ill and one of the effects of that was that T got a bit over-focused on my food intake.It was a really difficult thing for me to know about and I wished T had not told me and I told her that. It was also hard to talk about with her because I worried that it crossed the boundary between her as a therapist and her as a mother, especially if I texted her about it out of session when she wasn't necessarily in therapist mode. We did talk about it and I told her how competitive eating disorders are and how unhelpful it was to know what she'd told me. I also asked her if her daughter was well now and she said yes she was.The session after that, T said she had taken it to supervision and her supervisor had thrown her hands up in horror and said “what did you do that for?” in reference to her telling me. So I felt quite validated by that.I really don't know any details of her daughter's eating disorder or even what type it was. Someone on tumblr pointed out to me at the time that I am probably getting a much better deal from her being my therapist, than her ed-daughter is getting from her as a mother. Because therapy is so one-way and boundaried whereas family relationships with eating disorders involved are so much more complicated. That was very helpful and I felt much better after thinking about that.

Doc ID: 16490, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // emotional abuse  Ever since my therapist used the words “emotional abuse” two sessions ago, I've been trying to get my head round the concept. I started to think that maybe she would regret using those words because she just said them in passing and now here am I fixating on them. She's probably going to wish she'd never said it. So I asked her in session yesterday if she still thought that some of what went on was emotional abuse. (Don't be fooled, it took me several minutes to get that question out) In true therapist style, she wouldn't just say yes or no. She made me work for the answer.  She asked me what my gut feeling was, and I said it was that she had just said it to make me feel better in the moment but now she regretted it. We had a discussion about that. She said she didn't say things just to make me feel better. I said again “So are you saying yes or no to my question?” Slippery therapist, next she asked me how I would feel if she said yes she still thought it, or no she got it wrong. I said if you still thought it, I would feel…. relief… and I would feel… validated.  If you thought you'd got it wrong, I would feel like, ehh I knew it wasn't that bad, I was just being over dramatic. I probably made it sound worse than it was. T quoted back to me some things I'd written in my story and she pointed out how Not Normal these things were, and how contradictory it was for me to say it wasn't 'that bad'. I was trying really really hard with the eye contact at this point. T looked at me and said “That little girl being put through that and nobody stopping it! Yes comfort afterwards, but nobody putting a halt to it while it was happening. That was a misuse of power - that's what abuse is - over many years. It was emotional abuse.”  Finally she answered my question.

Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.30806943584125496 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15251, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // 👍  T's very first words after we'd logged in this session were “So, how were the A-level results?” She caught me by surprise a bit as I had intended to start by talking about her reply to my text, and instead I found myself answering her question. She followed it up with a couple of other questions, and then she asked me how I was after last session. She isn't usually as directive as this, with question after question. If I didn't have my stuff to talk about, I would be loving it.  I ignored her last question and said “Can I talk about something else first instead?” She said “Yes of course…. I just have a note in my diary that we would talk about endings this session, so I wanted to sort of tie up the loose ends from the last week first.” I nodded because I hadn't forgotten about the dreaded 'endings' talk, but I can't talk about anything more until I've got this said. I started, “I sent you that text about d's A-level results -“ T interrupted “Did you?”. She sounded surprised. “I don't think I got it” “Yes you did! You replied!” T scrolled through her phone. “Oh yes! So I did” “Uh, so, I didn't really like the thumbs up emoji for a reply. It felt like a brush off. Like I could have text you saying I was about to jump off a bridge, and you'd still have sent me a thumbs up.” T smiled “Yes, I see your point. I'm sorry… I think I was… let me see, what day was it… Thursday… oh yes I was busy doing my course and I didn't really register what was going on with the A level results till much later on” “Yeah… I think I just wished I'd not sent the text at all. I mean, I knew we were on a break so I wasn't expecting a big conversation. I just thought you might be wondering… you know, because we'd talked about d getting her results… so I wanted to tell you.” “Yes I understand, I'm sorry. I get things wrong sometimes…. It's actually important that I do, that I'm not perfect, because that helps you learn that we can make mistakes and we can recover from them, our relationship can recover. And I can't deliberately make mistakes! So that learning has to happen as an experiential thing, it happens organically in the therapy process and that's when we can look at it and deal with it.” And that was that. The conversation felt done. I think it gets easier to cope with these ruptures and repairs each time one happens. A few years ago, it would have taken me the whole session to manage to say what I was upset about. It really would. It would have completely sent me out of my window of tolerance, my anxiety over telling T how I felt would have been paralysing. I can take comfort from seeing how I've grown, and even though it still means uncomfortable situations, I can face the discomfort and disaster does not occur.

Doc ID: 16168, distribution: 0.21303057246534873 ; Therapy .. // screenshot   ——————————————————————————————————— This is the second screenshot I sent T. It's from “The Attachment Theory Workbook” by Annie Chen. I don't own the book, I was just browsing through it on amazon. When I read this paragraph, it really resonated with me. T read it and set off talking about it head-on at mph, and then seemed to realise what she was doing and pulled herself back a bit and gave me space instead to talk about how it resonated with me. I think this was a moment when her head wasn't fully in the game to start with. I talked about how H comes at me affectionately and it makes me pull away because I am not a touchy-feely person. But then the more I pull away, the more I feels he comes at me and his need for physical touch or closeness overwhelms me. T said maybe his love language is physical touch, and I said yes I think it is. I feel bad for not liking it, and then I feel bad for not being that person who does like it. I feel like H deserves someone nicer than me. H's brother and his wife are very touchy-feely with each other, and I think that's how H would like us to be and I just can't. T talked about how she would work if she was doing couples therapy with us. What she said wasn't really news. I know the theory of how couples therapy in that context works. T said she really only has a hazy view of H, and that's because of my avoidant nature impacting how I talk about him. T asked me if had spoken to H about any of this, and I said no not really. I said we used to talk a lot, before we got married, and we did talk about emotional stuff. But then we had babies and then my eating disorder got really bad and I was very shut down. And now I'm doing well in recovery from that but it's hard to find my way back to connecting with H again. I told her about how we went for a meal a couple of weekends ago and I did tell H quite a lot of the recent stuff we've talked about in therapy, and he surprised me by how well he dealt with it. T talked about how we have built up my trust in her and my relationship so that I can talk with her about all this stuff. I said yes but I don't have that trust with H, I don't trust that he will know how to respond. And then I can't think how I would carry the conversation, and then it all feels too hard.  “I'm going to set you some homework this week, Faith. I want you to find a time to talk with H about some of this, even if you just go for a walk around the block. Maybe you could tell him some of the process, even before you get onto the content. I mean like, tell him that you get uncomfortable talking about this, or that you worry he won't know what to say.” I looked very unconvinced at her. I told her how it all felt hard work, and I wasn't sure I wanted it. I think I said it was too much hard work several times through the session. I want it, but at the same time I know it's hard and uncomfortable to push myself to get to it, and so sometimes I feel like I will just stick with how things are. Towards the end of the session, T said “I've changed my mind on the homework. We'll leave talking to H for now. Instead I want you to think about how you would like it to be different between you and H.” I agreed to that (although I haven't really done it yet). 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said “”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.” I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 15120, distribution: 0.7516412587836758 ; Therapy .. // Part one // Chat  The Skype rang for a long time before T answered it this morning. I commented on it and she said yes, some mornings she was all ready twenty minutes before our session and some mornings it was all a mad rush and this morning was a rush, but she was here now. She asked how it had been taking d to uni, and I started talking about my week - d's driving test, my birthday, taking d to uni, her flatmates etc. At the same time as I was talking, I wondered at the back of my mind why I was using my therapy time to talk about all this. I guess all that stuff was at the forefront of my mind, and it was good to say it and get it out of the way. Plus I like to update T on what's going on in my life. T made a comment about how they seem so young to be going off to uni. It felt a bit ironic given what we have been talking about. I don't know whether she'd thought about what she said or whether it was a spontaneous comment. She said again, “Yes they seem so young when they go off to start their first year - and then they're like completely different people by the end of the year.” After about  minutes of chat, we came to a natural pause and it felt like I'd run out of “padding”. I don't know whether I was subconsciously avoiding jumping into the therapy work, but there was definitely a part of me that was comfortable with this more superficial chat. T sat back and said “So, where to today? Have you thought any more about what we talked about last week?” I told her that my week had been such a whirlwind that I had barely thought at all and I couldn't even remember much from last week's session. T gave me a quick rundown of what we'd talked about (basically just all the going to uni two years early stuff). She said I'd given the account of how it all happened from a very rational place, and if the  year old child in me could speak about her feelings about it all, what would she say? or if that child part wanted to speak now, what would she say?

I understand that - but you're not there now…. you can say anything here… so go ahead and say it!” I started talking about my mum's values and how she overvalued academic achievement, so I imagine that she didn't really think too much about the emotional impact on me now or in the future. My mum had her own values, she wanted to bring us up very innocent I think. She had no interest in keeping up with the latest trends. “That was ok for her, at home, but we had to go out into school and mix with the other children, and it was hard, to feel different.” T looked like she was still trying to understand what I was saying so I tried to explain further.  “Mmm, so this will sound like the most stupid shallow thing, but it's just the first example that comes to mind… so my parents never watched soap operas… Coronation Street or Emmerdale or Eastenders, all that kind of thing, and all my friends parents did, and my friends would always be talking at school about the plot lines and the characters, and I just had no idea who they were talking about. My mum thought soap operas were a waste of time, and she thought the storylines weren't appropriate, so she wouldn't have them on the TV.”  T got that and she added, “oh yes, and your mum wouldn't let you watch certain children's programmes either, would she?”, which was something we'd talked about the week before. I said no, she wanted to keep us quite innocent and in her world and that's all very well but we had to go out into the outside world, and I don't think it ever occurred to her that made it hard for us socially. It's been something I've always been very mindful of with my own children, I've never wanted them to feel left out or different in that way. I said the equivalent now would be like banning your kids from having tiktok, snapchat, Instagram etc. That's great when you're all at home and your kids can have other activities, but then they have to go to school each day and all their friends are talking about these apps and who said or did what in them, and your kids just can't join in and then they're left out - or worse, they're the weird kids who don't have these things…  We ran out of time at this point. We were already  minutes over because the internet had played up and T had had to move rooms to get a better connection. I was very spacey having spent so much of the session back in childhood. I could have done with T helping me with a bit of grounding, I'm sure she could see I was struggling to get fully back to the present. She was scheduling for next week and I was half there and half not, she repeated herself and then told me about a week in October when she won't be here. “But I am here next Tuesday, so I'll see you then.” We said goodbye and I managed to get myself present enough to be able to click off the call.

Doc ID: 16349, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // ending talk // part two  Then T said “but you brought up last week that you had been thinking about ending therapy….” I haltingly explained my thought processes around that. Mostly thoughts that ending therapy is a necessity at some point and that I want the ending to be well managed and enough time to do it properly, not have it forced upon us by external circumstances. I said that I hadn't intended to say it last week but I felt like after T had brought it up, I felt like I had to say it because if I waited till this week to say it, it would seem like I was just saying it sort of as a defence to what T had said. T said I was making good progress, some big leaps, in therapy and if I wasn't making any progress, she would be suggesting we finish. But I am making progress. I was thinking, are you talking me out of finishing? It felt a bit like that, even though she said “I'm not saying that I think we should finish this year or that we shouldn't finish next year” I do trust that she works very ethically and she has supervision, so I don't think she would talk me into staying as a client if she didn't think it was best for me. I asked “but how do you know when you're ready to end?” T said “Hmm I think you just know” I said “Yes but when we have a foster baby, imagine if there was a family all ready to adopt them and social care said to us, when will you be ready to say goodbye, what date would you like the move to be? I would say never. I'd never be ready. It feels like that with therapy.“ I said “On the other hand, I'm never going to know if I can cope with stuff, the stuff that will inevitably happen, without therapy, until I actually try it.” T agreed with me and talked again about how when we felt like the time was right, we could cut down therapy sessions, first to every fortnight for a while, and then to once a month. So we would have time to see how I coped without therapy in those in between times and get used to managing things myself. T said “Maybe you need to hear that this is about a relationship, for both of us. That we will both grieve it when it's ended. To do long term therapy, it has to become a relationship. We have a meaningful relationship and there will be a time of grieving when it's over.” We had lots of eye contact and I felt our good connection while she was saying this. After she'd said it, we sat quietly for a few moments. “How does it feel in your body right now?” T asked. Ugh I can't answer that. I scanned my body but there was nothing in particular there. I felt sad but it all seemed to be in my head. T said she felt a tightness in her chest and throat, like you might feel when you were sad. Even with her prompting I couldn't answer her question though. Eventually I told her “That's a too-hard question”. We sat quietly again. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14442, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // is this part ? I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. “When you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.” T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. “You look like you're about to say something” T commented. “I'm deliberating whether to say it or not” I said, pulling a face. “Go on then, let's just say it”  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said “ok, sooo… it was a blip”. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14353, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // reading between the lines  When we had finally got the internet issues resolved and we had a stable zoom connection, I sat there looking at T and feeling completely derailed after all the upheaval. “I feel all over the place now” I wailed, waving my hands in the air. T said yes she did too and she asked me if I'd like her to pray. This isn't something she usually does but it felt right in this situation. She prayed and I felt calmed and soothed and like we were centred and back together in the 'room'. So then I tried to get started. I said to T “Do you remember last session that I ran out of time to say something at the end?” and when she nodded I carried on “That was about something you said the session before… when you said you would always be honest and real with me.” T said she remembered that. I said that I had felt quite emotional when she said it. We dug down a little to find out what kind of emotion it was, and eventually I said that it was relief. That if I knew she was going to be straight up with me, then I no longer had to worry about reading between the lines of what she might be saying but not saying. I spent all my childhood reading between the lines of what my parents were saying, and it's hard work to always be hypervigilant for what's actually happening - or what you imagine is actually happening. The two things play into each other, when you're hypervigilant and highly sensitive, you can create whole scenarios that may or may not be based in reality. I don't know how much of that is me reading things between the lines that weren't there and getting upset about imagined scenarios that weren't actually reality, and how much is me genuinely picking up on things that were going on below the surface. I suppose that's something I have to be ok with not knowing because there's no way of going back in time with adult eyes to find out. I said to T that I needed her to know that if she says that she will be honest and real and I don't need to read between the lines, then I won't. And so if she wants me to know something, she needs to tell it to me straight up and not expect me to figure it out from what she's said. I said “so if we have a rupture and I get all stressed about something I've thought you've implied, then I'm going to try and soothe myself by reminding myself that you didn't actually say the words that my brain is creating from what you did say. So I need you to not get frustrated with me for not picking up on what you might have meant but not said.” It took ages for me to make clear to T what I was trying to say. I nearly gave up a few times and trailed off talking. She said “Am I not really getting you right now?” and I said “no, not really”. T encouraged me to stick with it and keep trying to explain it, and she did eventually get it and summarise it beautifully in a couple of sentences. When she did that, I immediately relaxed and smiled and nodded that she'd got it bang on. T said that was fine and she would continue to try her best to be be honest and real with me and she wouldn't expect me to pick up things she hadn't actually said. She reminded me that I can always check things out in session, if she's said something and I wonder if she's implying something else. I will try and do that, although often I don't process what she's said till after the session. I too quickly get caught up in session with “oh she must be meaning this” and then I tend to close it down with shame because my brain always translates it that she's trying to tell me I'm not good enough in some way. So that's something to watch out for in future sessions and also to try and spot when it happens to me in conversations with other people outside of therapy. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16181, distribution: 0.38035510776634807 ; Are you still there T?  If you remember, T asked if we could move this week's therapy session earlier in the day as she had to go away unexpectedly. I don't know where she was going or why, I never want to know that stuff. I figure it's probably not a fun reason she's having to go away though. I cannot bear it when my mum is upset or hurting… it feels really overwhelming to me. Read into that something from my childhood dynamics and you'd probably be right. It's the same with T. I can't deal with knowing any difficult things going on in her life, I can't lean on her as a safe dependable strong figure if I'm feeling all this pain I imagine she's in. So I have to shut myself off from any of her potential pain by avoiding knowing any of her personal life. It's been hard thinking that's she's “gone away” and is busy with her stuff. Little-Faith struggled with the idea that she “wasn't allowed” to contact T because T had enough to deal with and we shouldn't bother her. Not that I needed to contact her, but of course when something is off limits, we often suddenly have an intense longing for it. Today I felt like I needed to know if T was still “gone away” in the hazy unknown place, or if she was back nice and solid in her house. T has always been encouraging of me to text her when I need to feel our connection. She says it only takes a few seconds to reply to a text. I know early on in the relationship it was one of the ways we built up my trust in her, was to let me reach out to her when I needed to and see that she would be welcoming of it and not rejecting or punishing. I haven't needed to do it for ages but today I could feel little-Faith inside me feeling a bit abandoned, like T had dropped her and run off. So I decided it would be ok with ourself to message T and see if she was home. T replied and said she wasn't home yet but she was still 'here' even if she wasn't at home. I double checked and she replied again “yep, really still here”. Little-Faith felt hugely comforted and reassured by this, like now she can relax and know that T is still holding us even if she is away somewhere. I sent T an “ok 😊 thankyou” and she sent me back “👍😊”. Emojis are so useful. On a side note, I think T must have cancelled her clients today if she's not home, unless she didn't have any scheduled in. I hope she's back by next week.

Doc ID: 14593, distribution: 0.31222365834628835 ; Therapy .. // ending therapy thoughts  We had  minutes left after we'd spoken about the girls and their health kick and I asked T if we could talk about something else. I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  “Oh yes, I remember” T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . “I genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?” That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the “time to end therapy” is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said “uh I don't have much time left”. T said “Does it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?” and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16265, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // Ending talk // part three  “I've read some people's accounts of ending therapy, and what it seems like is therapy is like a box - a good box! - where everything is available and you can talk about pretty much anything. But then you leave therapy and the box closes and you can't get back in.” “Like a turnstile? Where you can only go one way through it?” “Yes. And then maybe the therapist says you can email updates afterwards or whatever, and you do but then you just get a generic sort of email reply. And you can't talk about it because you're not in therapy anymore. You can't talk about what it's like being outside the box because you can't get back inside to do the talking.” “Mmm yes. So maybe it would be better to have a clean break?” Omg I'm panicking a bit now, I don't know what she's storing up for future from these things I say. We had  minutes left and T said did I want to talk about anything else? I said I had been thinking about my childhood… the things we were talking about at the end of last year… and how all the stuff we talked about wasn't new things that I hadn't remembered before. But I used to say my childhood was perfect because I figured that's how it looked from the outside. And if it all looked shiny and perfect, it must be so. And if I didn't fit into that story properly, it must be because there was something wrong with me. And now we've done all this work on that and all the stuff we talked about, and now I realise that it doesn't matter what it looked like from the outside. For me, how it felt for me and what my experience was, that's what's important for me. I tried to explain this to my friend the other day. It's the first time I'd ever tried to put it into words to say out loud. It came out in such a jumble, that even though my friend knows about a lot of my stuff, I'm not sure she entirely got what I was saying. But I decided that was ok because it's all very new ideas still and I'm trying to get it straight in my head and like a baby learning to talk, sometimes strings of words come out that haven't been properly processed, but the act of trying to say them helps to organise them for the next time. I did a much better job verbalising it to T (I guess partly because she knows what I am trying to say and has her therapy head on so she can reflect back to me and help me get it coherent) T encouraged me with how much progress I've made since I started seeing her. It makes me smile because I was a terrible therapy client to start with. I wouldn't look at her, I only spoke to her in one word answers while looking the opposite way out of the window with my hand hiding my face. I froze up all the time, couldn't deal with silences, couldn't think about how I was feeling….. I think she had to work really really hard to build up the relationship and enough trust that I could start to feel safe. She did it though. And I worked hard too. T asked me about people seeing how much progress I've made. That's really hard because so much of it is internalised. I was really good at keeping a front up a lot of the time, having learnt from childhood how to hide all my feelings. So nobody really knew the extent of how bad things were inside. T went through loads of people, H, my sister, my best friend, other friends…. I was like, hmm I don't know. She said, but you're so much more confident now. That's true - now my outside matches my inside. Whereas before I could act confident but inside I was a ball of stress and the cost of appearing confident would be that I would use a whole heap of unhealthy coping strategies to keep my feelings squashed down. We got to the end of the session and looked at each other. T said, I feel like I want to tell you that I'm really proud of you. I said Thankyou.

Doc ID: 15714, distribution: 0.6875263443185431 ; Therapy .. // trying to stay present with the bombshell  After we'd said hello, T didn't say anything more, just sat and waited expectantly. That's unusual, she usually opens the conversation with a general question asking about how things have been. I don't know whether she plans beforehand how she's going to start, did she intentionally decide she wasn't going to give me a lead-in today? With hindsight, I wonder if she was waiting to gauge my mood before deciding whether to drop her bombshell on me or not. Or maybe she was waiting to see if I would bring the subject of her website up, since (also with hindsight) she felt that was something unspoken about between us that I might have thoughts about (I didn't!) Last week I had a real “everything is awful” session, so this week I told her I'd had a better week and I was feeling more cheerful. We talked about a couple of things that had been better, and that was a nice start to the session. I had some other things to talk about - I thought we could go through that list I posted on here last week about ways therapy can help disordered eating, and see how much progress I'd made - but before T gave me a chance to bring that up, she sat back and looked at me and said she had something to say. That's when she told me she has decided not to take on any new clients, even when lockdown is over, and that she will continue working with her current long term clients but she will set a date to retire. It will be about a year away from whenever she decides, so that we have time to work through anything that comes up. I could feel myself going into shutdown mode as she said it. It's like I retreat inside my body, so although I'm there looking out through my eye holes, my body just becomes a frozen shell that I'm hiding inside. My face sets in a neutral expression showing no emotion. I can't speak. Hiding inside, I'm safe, disconnected from what's coming at me. It's a strategy from childhood, although that makes it sounds like something thought out and planned, whereas in reality it's an instinctive survival mechanism. I could feel myself going there and I fought against it. I want this time to be different. T is a safe person to show my emotions to and I have experienced this over and over again. I want to stay connected and be authentic and let her see that I'm sad at this news. Not present my emotionless frozen face to her. I wobbled on the verge of shutdown, my body already falling down the same pathways but my brain scrambling to try and stay present. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15234, distribution: 0.6777111650874288 ; Therapy .. // endings  T brought the conversation back round to endings, as she had made a note in her diary previously for us to talk about it this week. We aren't talking about the practical details of imminent termination but I think T is working on a drip drip approach with the topic. She said she is going to bring it up once a month. I am finding that I am gradually managing to stay more present in conversations about ending therapy. Previously I would shut down completely at the mention of it, then there was a session just into the start of lockdown when T said she was now planning to retire in the next couple of years, and I felt myself going to that shutdown place and I fought against it and managed to stay mostly present. Since then we've talked about it twice more I think. My window of tolerance for staying with the topic is enlarging gradually. T always reminds me that she is not leaving yet, and that we will have a steady phase out of sessions over many months, not just a sudden end date. (Of course this is dependent on nothing unexpected occurring in her life or mine that forces us to stop therapy early. I am a little bit scared of that happening. It's one of the few positives to ending therapy that I can see, being in control of the end rather than having it suddenly pushed on us.) She asked me how the two week break had gone. I looked down and fidgeted a bit and then said “It was like part of me is like the baby when I go out of the room, she cries because she thinks I've gone forever. And then another part of me is like me in the other room, calling back through to the baby that I'm still here… So there's part of me that's wailing and crying and feeling abandoned because you're not here, and then there's another part that's saying it's ok, T is coming back, she hasn't disappeared, she hasn't left you…” T waited a moment to check I'd finished speaking, and then she said “That's really good, Faith! It shows you're learning to parent yourself now. That was something you couldn't do before.” I responded that it was one thing to do it now, when I knew she was coming back, but what will I do after we have ended therapy? There won't be that reassurance then. T said that maybe we can continue to do three monthly check-ins after we've officially ended. I don't know if she was saying that off the top of her head, I hope she has thought it through if so, because it feels a big thing to me. I would love to keep the connection and be able to check in every so often. I can see a parallel here with the way we say goodbye to our foster babies, and it makes me sad - but I'll keep that for another post.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.3006025279734075 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.6359747193192459 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

If you've been following the ups and downs of our relationship, you'll know how much that means. I can't remember if I wrote about it, but a couple of weeks ago things came to a head and I had a big and emotional chat with her one evening after she'd been particularly dismissive of us all over the evening meal. I can see she has been truly trying a bit harder since then. It reinforces my belief that she doesn't understand how other people feel until it is spelt out to her really clearly. And that holding the boundaries even while she pushes and pushes against them is actually giving her a sense of security. I also have hope now that she will grow through this phase and come to like us all again. Because now it's been made clear to her how she makes us feel, she is trying to improve that. Only in little ways but I see it. And the others see it too. Maybe the issue before was just that she didn't realise or think how we were being affected by her actions.  This afternoon she has baked a complicated five layer cake filled with buttercream and strawberries. It has been a complex dance for me of helping her make a success of it and being around and alongside her, while also ensuring that I give her enough space and privacy to get on with it. It was the classic push-pull…. “mum ok you can go away now… oh but mum how do you do this?” often repeated several times, catching me each time I was nearly out of the kitchen. She was so proud of her finished cake and when the others got in from the cinema we had a big reveal and everyone had a slice. d tolerated about  minutes with us, eating cake and telling her how wonderful it was, and then she retreated back up to her bedroom. It was a special afternoon and will keep me going for some time even if she goes back to hating us all for days on end now, I have hope that we will get through this 💕

Doc ID: 16898, distribution: 0.12576740299850026 ; Therapy .. // part one  I will try and write about this session but I can't remember it hugely clearly so I don't know how it's going to go. We started by talking about this week's weight, which was the same as last week's. T asked me how I felt about it, and I said the ed was disappointed I hadn't lost weight but after I'd got over that, I was relieved because it meant we wouldn't have to spend the whole of this session arguing over food and eating. T smiled at that and I did too and it was a little moment of connection. We talked again about what had happened two sessions ago and T repeated her apology. I said it felt like she'd left me and I was on my own while she was headed off somewhere else and it was scary. She said that her part in what had happened was her responsibility and she hadn't been on good form that day. Then I tried to explain something more about it to her, and she got all muddled up and reflected it back to me all wrong. I put my hands up to my head in a moment of frustration and then rested my head on my hand and hid behind my hair while I took a few deep breaths.  I started talking again all in a rush and my frustration was evident, but gradually it calmed down as T realised what I'd been talking about to start with and I felt like she was understanding me better. I had a moment of feeling like we were getting our relationship back on track, but then she unfortunately chose to say “I feel like things have shifted since the start of the session. At the start of the session it felt like you didn't want to talk. But now I've talked about taking responsibility, it feels like things have shifted a bit? You feel a bit warmer to me?” Ugh it was too soon for that. Yes, I was starting to feel a bit warmer towards her, but she doesn't get to assume everything's getting back to normal yet. Immediately I felt irritated again and froze her out again. I didn't feel she'd worked hard enough to repair things and now it seemed she was trying to short cut it and be like “oh maybe everything's ok now?” and it most definitely wasn't. In fact it went several steps backwards at the moment she said this. She definitely picked the wrong moment to make her comment. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16141, distribution: 0.2509746385137204 ; Therapy .. // can I change my attachment style?   We settled into the session. The light was shining in through T's window and making it hard for me to see her so she closed a blind and checked back if I could see her better. Sometimes she's in her therapy office when we Skype and sometimes she's in another room in her house, so one of the first things I do when we connect is check out what's in the background and figure out where she is.  We talked about the task T set me last week, which was to think about what I would like to be different in my relationship with H. We've been talking about my avoidant attachment style and I asked T how I can change it. Yes I've learnt a secure attachment in therapy with my therapist, but I want to know how I can take that outside the therapy into my relationship with my husband.  I do want a secure attachment with H, but at the same time I think about the hard work it could take to get there and the uncomfortable feelings, and I am unsure if I want to push through that enough. I said to T, “Sometimes I want it, and sometimes I just want to want it” T accepted that, she reflected it back to me and we talked about it a bit. Then she came back to my list and asked me what was on it. I said the first thing was that I want to not feel like there's something wrong with me. Wrong because I hate some things so much that I think normal people would like. I talked about compliments and some sorts of affectionate touch. T got a bit sidelined into thinking it was about body image, which I don't  really think it is. I don't think I have particularly bad body image. Of course I have bits on my body that I think could be better, but on the whole, I'm happy with how it looks.  As the screenshot from last week said, being close to H feels stressful for me. It's the effect of my avoidant attachment style. Without batting an eyelid, T brought up the subject of sex. We talked about that a bit. It's somewhere we've never really gone before so it was quite weird. New ground. She was very matter of fact about it so I took my cue from her and used it to keep myself regulated while we were talking. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14376, distribution: 0.09217245396616626 ; Therapy .. // building connections with d  We mostly talked about how things with d have been. It was all good really, because T knows how much I have struggled in my connection with her over the years. I think d's attachment to me may have been damaged when she was a baby because my eating disorder was at its worst and I wasn't as emotionally available for her as I could have been. I've been trying to make up for that time ever since I learnt more about attachment and could start to make sense of what was going on between us. This last year feels like it has been really healing for us. I found some small actions that d allowed me to do for her, and that started building more connection between us and seemed to let her start to take some nurture in. It's been tentative certainly on my part for months, wanting to push things but just the right amount, never quite sure exactly how much connection d will tolerate before she pushes me away. But now things feels so much better. Maybe it's been lockdown and having her at home and “in the nest” with me and that blast of more intensive nurturing. Maybe it's partly her age, growing through the age of , which in my three times of experience is not the nicest age. It was really good to talk about all this with T. It's all been going on in the background for the last year and longer and to reflect on it with T was helpful. I talked about how I had to override my mums voice in my head so many times, when I was trying to do small things to build connection with d. My mums voice that says “she can do that for herself!” and I imagine my mum shaking her head and thinking I am babying d. So I have had to learn to go against that, and although I know my mum can't see what I'm doing, I still felt guilty and wrong when I do so. I said to T that sometimes I feel a bit naughty doing something I know my mum would roll her eyes at, and T punched the air and said YESSSSS We talked a little bit about reading between the lines and how my parents could act like they were giving me a choice about something, while it not really being a choice because I also knew what they wanted me to choose. Kind of like “oh yes, you can do xyz if you like - but you'll have to do it for yourself/ pay for it yourself/ sort it out yourself” while knowing full well that any of those things would be beyond me in that situation. As a sensitive child, I could completely read that situation that meant that actually they didn't want me to do those things, and because I wanted to please them and avoid conflict, I would then go with the choice that I knew they wanted me to choose. A sort of emotional blackmail by my parents. I wanted to tie this in with T telling me the week before that she would always be honest and real with me, and how much that meant. The relief that she would just be upfront with me and I didn't have to read between the lines and try and figure out about what she might be actually be saying. But that's what we ran out of time to talk about so I will try and bring it up in tomorrow's session. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17232, distribution: 0.29009207422022687 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me “Do you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?”. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be “No”, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15195, distribution: 0.19860919233949284 ; Therapy .. // Are you on my side?  I had just spoken with T about wondering whether my parents worried about me going off to university at a young age. I felt that T's response to that was quite invalidating. I can't remember now exactly what she said but something about not assigning blame and that my parents loved me. It seems like we have done all this work in therapy getting to an acceptance that my parents weren't perfect, yet now every time I allow myself to express a little spark of anger or even dissatisfaction or sadness over them and their actions, T jumps in and tries to smooth it all over. That just throws me right back to my old thought patterns that clearly my parents were great and it's me that's somehow wrong, that the critical part of me that's rolling her eyes and saying 'ffs Faith you make such a big deal out of nothing' is right. “It always feels like you're defending them” I said to T, in a resigned tone of voice. “Oh no, no I'm not defending them. I'm definitely not defending some of their decisions. I'm definitely not defending them pushing you ahead two years at school.” I shrugged at her. Her intentions and words don't seem to match up. She said “Maybe we need to talk some more next session about my views of their actions and their relationship with you” I nodded, and said a bit defeatedly “It feels like you're on their side” “I'm on your side, Faith. I'm definitely on your side.” We were nearly out of time and it felt like she was back-pedalling and trying to end on a reassuring note rather than a rupture. “I'm sorry if it feels like I'm not on your side. I really am. I think that's another thing that would be good to talk about next week… how does that feel?” I heard her saying that she was on my side. I'm glad she said it so many times because it did help it sink in and gave me something to hold on to. I still feel a bit let down by her though in the way that I brought some feelings to therapy and she shut them down without exploring what was going on for me. She seems so worried that she will damage my relationship with my parents that she won't hold space for me to say negative things about them. That makes it really hard for me to try and recalibrate my views of them, from them being perfect to a more realistic view that they did their best but they didn't get everything right.  “I know this is a really horrible place to end” - T emphasised the 'horrible' - “but we really are out of time now.” We had already gone ten minutes over to make up for the poor internet connection, which she'd offered earlier in the session, so I know that by the time we finished she did probably have to dash off to her next client or whatever. I just nodded in acceptance and we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. I noticed immediately afterwards that I hadn't said “thankyou” like I usually do at the end of a session. I guess I was still feeling her lack of attunement. There's a lot to process in next week's session.

This week has so far reminded me that laughter truly is the. best. medicine. Honestly, I laughed until I cried on the evening of my dude's birthday when we did our little family non-pub pub quiz. Without a doubt, the highlight of my lockdown so far. Cats are apparently really 'lucky' when they fall, Elton John's first hit single was 'Baby' and the Great Fire of London was in  (if you've seen the vlog, you know) 😂

I also laughed this entire morning editing the Q&A Em and I filmed, also on her birthday. Coming @  today (farts and laughter all included) 😉

So here's my reminded to all of you guys reading to have a laugh and almost wet yourself. On the daily. I am generally a very uptight person, and often find it hard to let loose shall we say. But wow, we're high not only on green smoothies right now, but a lot of serotonin and endorphins too. And it feels good 😏🙈

Anyway, as promised, I wanted to share on here some of my top P O D C A S T recommendations! Over the past few months I learnt so much just by regularly tuning in to a podcast, everything from feminism to the benefits of eating garlic. I'll listen whilst waking, running or even when I'm spinning on my bike, and it's really taught me to learn and absorb information just by simply listening.
-
These are in no particular order, but here are the five that I listen to most often:
-
 // @adultingpod by @oenone which I mention all the time . . . but it is probably my favourite. I'd never learned a lot about feminism before, and Oenone has taught me so 👏🏻 much 👏🏻
-
 // The @deliciouslyella podcast was a recent discovery but I could listen to Ella on repeat over and over again. One of my favourite episodes was their one with Joseph Poore about veganism and climate change.
-
 // @howtofailpod by @elizabday I looooooove. The last one I listened to was with Tara Westover because I was so inspired by her memoir “Educated”.
-
 // No Such Thing as a Fish. I don't know what to say about this one other than the fact that it's hilarious. I never seem to remember any of the crazy facts they come up with, but the concept of the podcast is so unique.
-
 // And finally Give Me Strength by @aliceliveing 💪🏻
-
I've listened to a few episodes of @thegirlsbathroom and Today in Focus by the @guardian. I can also recommend About Race by @renieddolodge, Go With The Fall (by Flo herself who reached out to me), Ankita's podcast in Oz @universitypodcast (I was in a couple of episodes 😉), @nutrition_facts_org and @coffeebreakgerman 🇩🇪

In our small group on the tour (with @wayoutbackaus), we had this place all to ourselves for the majority of the time we spent there. Jumping off rocks into the water was also so. much. fun ... despite standing on the edge for a good  minutes deciding whether or not I had the courage to do it 😅 It wasn't even that high, but there's something about jumping into bodies of water that freaks me out a bit. Maybe because I can't see underneath?! I don't really know why, but my legs were shaking anyway. This trip is also all about facing my fears and stepping outside my comfort zone anyway, so I'm glad I did it. Oh and this will just be a mini warm up before the much bigger ones to come soon 😬

Swipe to see my classic waterfall gram shot, attempt at floating like a starfish (which I can't even do, I just sink 🤷🏻‍♀️) and how I feel about the crocodiles 🐊 ... this water was safe btw, don't worry (I wouldn't be typing this otherwise 😜) but I was still a bit wary of the waters 🤨

Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I have SAD, seasonal affective disorder, which is defined as depressive episodes that follow a seasonal pattern. But the weather does alter my mood for sure 🧬
-
SAD itself is thought to occur in roughly  million people in the UK alone, and those with this disorder typically show signs of low mood and reduced energy levels throughout the winter months.
-
Whilst research still needs to be done, seasonal mood fluctuations may be linked to the biology of serotonin: a neurotransmitter responsible for promoting happiness, pleasure and satisfaction 😊 Sunlight may, for example, regulate serotonin uptake into neurons (nerve cells) resulting in an increase in its activity in summer and a corresponding decrease in winter. Pretty cool, right 🤓
-
Research also points to the hormone melatonin, as well as vitamin D, but my advice regardless of the nitty gritty details is to get yourself outdoors!! If you're in UK right now, or you live somewhere and it's getting warmer, please please please take advantage of the sunshine 🌞👌🏻 Go outside, go and watch the sunset, or eat your breakfast under the sunshine one morning, because trust me, you'll feel a whole lot better for doing so 👏🏻

To me, romanticising your life isn't looking for the perfect moments in your life, it's about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little moments. It's about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Be intentional.
Be thoughtful.
Be there for yourself.
Get all dolled up in your favourite dress & do it just for YOU!! Which outfit was your fav? 🙈 P.s. these dresses are all from @showpo's Full Bloom collection!! My code “BREE” will give you % off! 🥳 ad

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It's necessary. It's empowering. FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

What kind of things fill your cup??? ☕️ I'd love to hear it, no matter how exciting or mundane it is!! It might give someone else some ideas for ways they can fill theirs as they scroll through💡

It's basically an indoor fairground with on-site food and drinks (lots of good vegan stuff and non-alcoholic drinks as well), and trusttttt me you guys, it's soooo so much fun wow 🙌🏻 Sara and I did take our games very seriously (and you definitely work up a sweat if you're properly going for it like we were 😅), but it's the perfect way to spend time just laughing and having a great time with your friends or family . . . thank me later✌🏻

It is very reasonably priced with tickets costing £ per person and you get a slot that lasts  hour  minutes 👌🏻 The aesthetics of the venue are also such a cool vibe 🤓

Tomorrow I'm back diving again and I am literally buzzing. I cannot wait to be one with the fish again 😅 ... no but seriously, I love it so much. And one thing I'm quickly learning is that you really have to trust your gut feelings and intuition. If you love something, do it, and if you don't ... well don't 🙃

Who knows what I'm going to do in the future, and I don't ever want to commit my life to one path anyway, but I'm really grateful for all the opportunities that are open to me at the moment. Travelling has also opened my eyes to so much more, and so many other things I never thought I'd even try, let alone fall in love with. Yeah ... I specialised in cancer and immunology in final year, but it's never too late to change direction, right?

I also never liked the sea that much either. All the fish, jellyfish and goodness knows what else in the water that I could never see always freaked me out. I would completely flip each time I'd first get in (and provide very good beach entertainment too 😅). -year-old Holly was even content simply just seeing photos of the underwater world, and always said I'd never want to see it myself.
-
But ok. So here's the thing. I'm now a qualified PADI Open Water Scuba Diver, and as I said, it's total madness to me. Besides dancing, learning to dive has been the most rewarding skill to master and I even want to take it further. I genuinely cannot wait to be back swimming with the fishes ... and sharks ... and turtles ... (if you saw the vlog, you know) 😏

And yes, the Great Barrier Reef is beautiful. Waaaay way better than the photos 😉. Enjoy this little montage of Holly in her scuba gear, and again, I want to say a huuuge thank you to @divers_den for being incredible. If I ever return to Australia, I want to be back on the Ocean Quest in Cairns without a doubt, and if you guys want to learn to dive, please check out their tours. For reference, I did the -day course (a gifted experience) which includes your scuba theory, pool work,  training dives and  dives when you qualify (including a night dive) 🦈 It's also the only company in Australia offering up to  dives a day!

@punchbowlsocial is back open in the flats at east bank, and they have a great happy hour at from -pm sunday and wednesday-friday. the staff did a great job at making the space a safe environment to dine, drink, and play games with wearing masks, regularly sanitizing the game and activity areas, and ensuring social distancing. if you are comfortable with going out right now, i would definitely recommend going!

-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (😉), let's talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg 🤩 It's not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip 🏝
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our £ a night hotel room . . . £ you guys!!! 😱 It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)👌🏻
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay 👏🏻
-
🇹🇭 Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you 🙈 They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
🇹🇭 Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point 😆 . . .
-
🇹🇭 The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up 😂 It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great 😅
-
🇹🇭 I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing 🤨 There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country 😍 Please please visit 💚✨

Describe your day in emojis below! Would love to try to guess what you got up to. I hope it was a happy day 🤗✨ 

Here's a lil to-do list when it comes to planning a successful solo date:
• firstly, set yourself up for a happy day: morning skincare [@cerave_aunz ad], yummy breakfast, a bit of movement and/or a plan!! 📆
• put on a cute outfit 💃🏻 
• go somewhere that makes you happy ☀️ 
• do something FOR YOURSELF 🤝
• smile at / speak with strangers 😁
• seek the good in your day - appreciate the sky, the flowers you walk past, the smells, the sounds, the atmosphere, people laughing, working, eating. It doesn't always feel like it, but there's so much beauty out there if we seek it.
🌸 💐 🌸 

Hopefully this encourages you to plan a solo date! I get it, dating yourself sounds weird. I certainly felt weird (and super nervous) at first. Now, I feel like an independent, confident, self-sufficient woman!! 👸🏼 It's one of the best ways to get to know yourself and explore how you feel and act in certain situations, what your drawn to, what you have to offer yourself and others, what you like, what you don't like, the list goes on. I've learned that I'm able to make conversation with strangers, that I can have fun on my own, that I actually don't enjoy water parks, but I LOVE roller coasters and thrill rides. These solo dates have helped me become even more self-aware 🤝

I ALWAYS start my day with my @cerave_aunz AM skincare regime & end with my CeraVe PM skincare regime so I thought I'd share that in today's solo date too ☺️ It's lightweight, fast-absorbing, fragrance-free, paraben-free, non-irritating, gentle on skin and Developed with Dermatologists 🥰 love love love!

This week has been super busy, the usual (💁🏻‍♀️), but also very social, not the usual for me
... and I'm loving it! As soon as I stepped off the plane arriving back in the UK, I said to myself that I didn't want to let go of the person I'd found in Australia: the new habits, mindset changes and little growth in confidence. So far it's been pretty successful. In fact, even people who knew me semi-well before as well as strangers (😱) have noticed a change, which is crazy.

Doc ID: 2555, distribution: 0.18571663811218955 ; Welcome to the most INTERESTING solo date I've ever had 🥲

Today reminded me that the most important opinion of you is your own! Be you, you are enough 💛

This was another day of overcoming old fears. Growing up, I avoided the beach because I didn't feel comfortable in a bikini. So if I ever went, I wore long t-shirts or a one-piece or a sarong or high-waisted bottoms, just to hide myself. For this week's solo date, I wanted to combat that! Here's how it went 👀

I MAKE THE TIME for these solo dates because it's so important to me to step outside of my comfort zone, challenge myself, grow as a person, maintain my own independence & learn about who I am, what I love doing & how I'm feeling. It's the perfect opportunity to sit in your thoughts, reflect & come back feeling refreshed! 

Even if there were a few doubts & negative opinions being projected onto me by a male stranger in his late 's 🥲

You'll always be “inspirational” in someone's eyes, yet “uninteresting” in someone else's. “Talented” to a friend and “talentless” to another. The world's never gonna agree on a definition of who or what you are, so just focus on you & do what makes you happy 🥰

As you can see, when situations like these arise, my coping mechanism is not to get angry or sad. I get up, shake out the tension/stressful feeling, go for a walk & repeat some affirmations to myself. These are a few of the things I do to help me reframe my mindset when I start thinking negatively towards myself. But tbh, after all of that, I still felt down throughout the day & that's okay too. Not every day has to be a happy one 🌧💛

All in all, even when you're in a relationship, I think it's important to date yourself & have alone time outside of your partner, friends & family! 🙌

What are some ways you work through negative feelings to bring some joy & kindness to your mind??? Would love to hear them 🌸

Also leave a “🙌” in the comments if you're gonna take yourself on a solo date!! Highly recommend ✨

It's the end of the week and I'm like ... wow. Can we stop to breathe yet? The answer is no, but it's that sweet feeling of satisfaction you get after ticking something off your to-do list that keeps you going, am I right? Yes, it's a bit crazy sometimes with an ever expanding list of things to complete, but in all honesty, Holly thriiiiiives being busy ok. I kind of love it 💚

The arrival of my new purchase the other day was also definitely the highlight of yet another week in quarantine, and with Dad's help in building it I managed to give it a go for the first time yesterday. It's fair to say that I am PUMPED and so please with my new 'toy' (yet to be named) ... and it will be hitting the vlogs soon next week 😏

I've only recently, over the past two years or so, found the confidence to spend time alone in a cafe or restaurant out in public . . . and yes, who remembers me doing this earlier in  on Valentine's Day itself 🙈😅 I mean, that was definitely a classic Holly thing to do though lol 😉
-
But in all seriousness, one of my favourite ways to enjoy spending time alone is by taking myself out to try new food, especially on my travels 🌎 This mini-solo date was filmed in Switzerland, and the biggest shoutout to @mairuebe_luzern for having me 🥰🤌🏻 It's a fully vegan, family run business in Lucerne (or Luzern) and I'd highly recommend visiting if you're nearby!! #gifted 
-
There is something so special about enjoying your own company, and it can simply be through just reading in a park, going on a long walk and listening to a podcast or working in a new cafe . . . there are literally so so many things you can do! And what's best is that you're the only one who needs pleasing 😏

So if you're currently scared of doing something like this, or find it difficult to be alone with just yourself, then please please please make it one of your goals for , and trusttttt me, you're going to love it 🤩💚

-
Before I arrived in Australia, this was one of my biggest worries on my itinerary. And that might sound surprising, but it was because the thought of going on an unguided -day road trip with people I'd only just met really made me feel quite anxious. And because the trip hadn't been booked in advance, unlike the rest of my travels, I was just getting super stressed (Darryl, you'll know 😅).
-
When I then arrived and completed my first tour with Welcome to Travel, of course the homesickness hit with full force and I did feel really overwhelmed. It has also taken time to settle down a bit too. Hence, I felt a lot more comfortable booking a guided tour. I did the -day trip with Wildlife Tours, which takes you all along the 'greatest ocean road in the world' (can confirm, the scenery and landscapes are amazing!) and then into the Grampians. It totally exceeded my expectations and I met some incredible people: definitely people I'd now call friends 🙌🏻
-
I am trying to make sure that I include all my first impressions, thoughts, feelings, worries and anxieties in my vlog series, because I think it's really important to just show you that I am a real person. I struggle a lot in social situations, especially in novel contexts, and solo travelling in really pushing me out of my comfort zone. I am also doing a lot of things for the first time, which is craZy 😬 ... and a lot of them are honestly CRAZY things that I never, ever, thought I'd do 🙈

-
() The penguins. Hands-down, they were the highlight of Melbourne for me. I don't need to say anything else! () Seeing and feeding kangaroos for the first time 🦘() My top fun fact is that in any emergency, all the trams receive a signal to stop so that the emergency services can utilise the tram lanes and arrive in the place they need to be as quickly as possible. I think this is such a neat idea! () Sweaty runs around the parks in the morning have been so refreshing and the best way for me to de-stress and settle any feelings of anxiety or homesickness. () The fruit at the Queen Victoria market is goooooold. Oh my goodness I am so glad I came in mango season, you guys, I've literally never tasted better mangoes before in my life. () The ballerina I found in the street art was a cute little addition to our laneway tour. ) The view of the skyline from the rooftop bar never gets old and () neither do the beaches ☀️
-
Of course I'll take many more memories away from my first official tour in Australia, but these are just some of the small things that came to mind earlier today when I wrote my first diary entry. As I said on my story, I am currently working on the next couple of videos which I am super hyped about. And to be honest, I am so excited to share this whole trip with you guys, as you can probably tell! The next few weeks (… and months) are going to be non-stop crazy, but now that I'm starting to feel better in myself, I am really starting to embrace this huge adventure on the other side of the world. I just keep telling myself that it was my dream to come here … so I have to make most of it!

-
I flew home on the th of February  and wow . . . Landing back in the UK, seeing Mum and Dad again in the airport, waking Matthew up in his bed and being reunited with my dude (if you remember the vlog, you'll know 😏) are memories I'll never forget. Ahhh what a journeyyyyy (and I don't even care if that's cheesy) 🌎
-
I also don't know why it's taken me so long to post these pictures!!! I never did it at the time, but my meet-up has also got to be one of the happiest days of my whole entire life!!! I was very very close to calling it off and not doing it, because yes, in all honesty I was SO scared (🙈), but I'm so glad I didn't. And I mean Kez, your Instagram message definitely made me change my mind last-minute 😉
-
Having people that follow your life online and enjoy your content is one amazing thing in itself, but actually meeting you guys in-person, like that blows. my. mind 😩🤩 Whilst I may be an introvert at heart, I was literally able to be myself for a day with friends from the Internet that know me, vibe with me, and just simply get me. Like I'm a strange, crazy character as we know, but that's just what you get both on, and off-camera 🙃
-
From casual chats in a library to public photoshoots, sharing dips for chips (yes, we were immediately all very close when I decided to double dunk oops 😂😅) to watching me lick a plate of chocolate clean, this day will always have a very special place in my heart 💚🌿
-
I'm so sorry Instagram only lets me post  pictures, but I am going to share some more on my stories too ☺️ And the bigger picture here is that YOU guys are amazing and I never thought I'd have an incredible TEAMMMM, because yes we are a team (🙈), of followers in a small corner of the Internet I can call my own 💫

I am also hoping that I've missed the worst of the winter season here and the temperatures will only increase from now onwards, although my weather app did show snow at one point the other day and I was like ummmmmmm maybe I jinxed it 😬🤦🏻‍♀️
-
I never actually saw myself as someone who enjoyed hotter weather, sunshine and the beach lifestyle. But I can % say that I'd be in shorts over trackies any day. In Australia I just simply got used to putting suncream on every day and by the end of my trip it really didn't bother me anymore. I also think that it felt like a different kind of heat to the UK. It's part of the culture there in Australia so the country is prepared for it, whereas on that one day in the UK each year (if we're lucky) when we have a  degrees C heatwave ... everyTHING and everyONE shuts down; we all start complaining; there's no air con; all the Brits go to town on the sun bathing and we burrrrrrrrn like bacon, no word of a lie 😂 Having said all that, I do quite like my beanie at the moment ngl, and it helps to cover up my hair when it's a bit too frizzy for my liking. @narnastore I see potential there…
-
Aside from the weather, I am definitely finding my feet back home and feeling busier than ever, which I love! Back tutoring, the cat hair is everywhere, I've been catching-up with friends, pulled along by Bali and Java, and I even felt like a student again staying overnight in student accommodation by the @londonistdmc (gifted). Despite being, yes, on the more expensive side, the agency is very well recognised and reviewed by students. If you watched my story yesterday, the en-suite room I was given had everything I needed all-in-one, and Chapter King's Cross also had study areas, a gym, screening room, / reception (so you felt very safe) etc etc etc.

-
🍔 I was quick to realise that the Aussie BBQ is for sure a BiG thing! I've never had so many in my life, and if you ever do a tour in Australia, a BBQ is guaranteed. @lordofthefries was also bomb!!!
-
💆🏻‍♀️ Now does anyone notice the subtle curls in my hair in this first photo? And that's because I didn't wash my hair for the last  months of my trip. You're probably thinking “ew Holly” right now, but let me tell you, this did wonders for my hair (sadly probably all being reversed now).
-
🔥 The burn lines were not a vibe (when I forgot to lather myself in factor  sometimes oops)!
-
🌞 You know what also wasn't a vibe? When you look pale as anything at the very end of your  month trip at surf camp! Like what even happened!!! I do blame the lighting though, no further comment . . .
-
💥 Still cannot believe I bungee jumped three times, one of which was backwards?????
-
🌴 I seriously don't think I could bungee jump again (I can simulate the same feeling I had standing on the edge of the platform just by looking back at the photos!), but I'd fall from the sky any day. Despite looking high in these photos, it was EPiC!
-
🌚 The mysterious 'holes-in-bag' story from Fraser Island that's never been solved (if you know, you know 😬).
-
🏕 My first night swag camping, and actually freezing (yes, counterintuitive I know), will be something I never forget. Camping is not for me ok, but at least I tried it!

If you do ever want a mini-series to watch, #hollygoessolo will forever be my favourite series on my channel. There were over  episodes just from Australia!!! Popcorn is necessary, that's all I need to say 😉

We all know it's a daily occurrence for Holly to talk about Australia at least once, right? I also often find myself scrolling through my camera roll (which is, yes, % Australia anyway) and this helps me re-live the memory. It's such a mood oh myyyyy and I live for it. Travelling photos and my vlogs certainly make me crave another adventure, but I keep reminding myself that there will be other perfect opportunities to explore, even if it's not right now.

Speaking of the present, over this past week I've somehow managed to scribble out my whole plan for the next (academic) year and start a fresh new blank canvas. No joke, I am back at square one with what I am doing next year. Of course, I keep you all updated but right now it is quite confusing and I just need a bit of time to, well . . . re-start basically 😬

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok 😏).
-
The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes 👏🏻 please 👏🏻
-
We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push 🤨 ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.
-
Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! 😅You cannot win with British people I'm afraid.

This era is all about the hustle and grind, there's a “need” to be productive, with guilt associated with rest. Working hard is important… But just as important is the ability to allow yourself to step back & just BE 😅 | ad

Hustle without rest leads to burnout. So yes, taking care of yourself IS productive, which is why my weekly solo dates are essential in my life! 💐 

Today on my solo date I had a pamper, phone-fee, self-care day:
🌟 made myself some cozy, delicious food — it's that time of the month so ya girl's sweet tooth is stronger than ever 🙈🍫 
🌟 had a morning dance jam, of course! 🕺🏼
🌟 watched Brooklyn  on the projector screen in my cabin with more snacks 🎥 
🌟 did a light workout outside 🏋🏻‍♀️
🌟 lounged around in my new matching loungewear sets from @nurrture 😍
🌟 read a book in the bath 📖 

Do you struggle with feeling guilty when you're not being productive? Leave a “😅” below if you do. I definitely do… So you're not alone there, but I hope this lil reminder will inspire you to take some time to enjoy what life has to offer outside of “the hustle” — what are the ways you nurture your mental health & enjoy your own company? 🧘🏻‍♀️ Let me know in the comments, I might give them a try next time 🥳

P.s. all loungewear in this post is from @nurrture's new Winter/Spring collection — where all profits are donated to buy food for those in need 🥺 food parcels are delivered on a fortnightly basis & the next destination they will be supporting is Nepal, so if you'd like to treat yourself to an extremely cozy & cute set, you'll also be helping a family in need — thank you 💛 I love working with brands who have a mission to make a difference, and not only that, a brand that encourages you to be who you are & approves my silly content (including but not limited to me tooting in this post 💨) 😂 I mean….

#tb to my time on Magnetic Island, which, fun fact for you all, actually got the name because Captain James Cook thought that the island had an effect on his compass (but this isn't actually true)! It is located off the coast of Townsville and highly worth the visit for sure. I took the time to explore a lot of the the hiking trails, beaches and bay areas all on my own.
-
Out of the context of a tour and without a tour guide, I definitely feel like a proper solo traveller 😉 It gives you more freedom to do what you want and make your own plans each day, however having said that, I've honestly loved all the tours I've done so far. Since it was my first time travelling solo, I've also felt more comfortable being in a tour group, and it's definitely allowed me to build up my confidence as a young backpacker.
-
If you watched my story yesterday, there's a little chat coming up in the next episode all about how I've found travelling alone and whether I've felt safe or not. Yes, and unfortunately, there have been times when I didn't feel comfortable at all. It wasn't anything serious, and I managed to get myself out of each situation pretty easily, but sometimes you can feel a bit unsafe when travelling, especially alone. Quite ironically however, on all occasions I was actually in a public space with lots of people around!
-
So yes, I've wanted to talk about safety for a while and I finally found the time to do it the other day (in a  bed mixed hostel room actually too 😅). Things like: where do I keep my passport? What's the big bulky thing I wear on my wrist sometimes? Do I ever leave my bags unattended etc? Stay tuned for the vlog today at pm UK time and I'll speak to you then ... hopefully I won't schedule it wrongly this time 🤦🏻‍♀️✌🏻😉

📚 a day at the library 
🏃🏻‍♀️ a hike

Wellies are essential, and we pretty much wear them all year round. The mud is also inTense right now, and I definitely have proof on my stories 😂

Just out of curiosity, please comment done below if you've never worn wellies before. I am genuinely intrigued because they are literally an integral part of my life. That's not even a joke ok 😅

I felt incredibly grateful to have received such positive and insightful messages, comments and emails from you all, and I know that my job now is to try and actually deal with the problems (for once in my life).

Whilst @veganmutti sent me the cutest pictures of Bali ad Java the other day and the realities of being so far away from home suddenly came flooding back to me, there's just something so special about this place on the other side of the world that I simply love. It's the beaches, the sun, my (tiny) tan, the ocean, the wildlife … gahhhh there is literally so much that I'm going to miss.
-
It's also very likely that I'll be landing back in the UK and hit by full-on winter weather (because the seasons and climate, as we all probably know, are a bit screwed up). The temperature contrast will be pretty shocking and my tan will probably fade all too quickly. So after  months of building up a bit of a glow, it will be gone in just a few days I'm afraid, and that in itself makes me very very sad 😳😭
-
When I realised the other day that my first big solo adventure was coming to an end pretty soon, I was like this. is. it. I have to make the most of every last second I've got here, and ngl, I think I've done pretty well. Here in Byron Bay, I made a list of all my 'bucket list' activities and I've been ticking them off faster than the spread of coronavirus if I'm completely honest (a global pandemic we should not take lightly I know, but just a useful comparison, sorry I couldn't resist 🙃). And despite bad news the other day with one of my courses being cancelled, I've still managed to find a way to swim with the fish again 🐠 (all coming soon in the next vlog 😉).

Tomorrow, if all goes to plan, I'm attempting to eat out for all  meals as I've already mentioned. I'm pumped for some epic vegan food, but I do still have some decisions to make because there are waaaaaaaay way too may good eateries to try here in Byron. I'm spoilt for choice and drooling over every menu. The prices, well, I'm not a fan of, but the food is there to be enjoyed, right? 😝

Doc ID: 2552, distribution: 0.1717890609407815 ; It's hard to love yourself if you never spend time with yourself. Alone time is necessary 🌱

And by alone time, I don't mean scrolling through social media or watching a TV show, I mean making the time to be present, soak up your life & do what brings you joy.

Welcome to my th ✨SOLO DATE DIARY✨ entry 📖 

To me, romanticising your life isn't looking for the perfect moments in your life, it's about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little mundane moments. Being present in the ups & downs. It's about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I, myself, am extremely guilty of this… But I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Before dating myself, I had no idea I could be confident enough to go to an arcade on my own, dine in alone, sit by myself & get lost in a book with the hustle & bustle of life all around me.

I had no idea I could be alone without feeling lonely.

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It's necessary. It's empowering. I'm sure we've all heard the saying “you can't pour from an empty cup” & it's true. I urge you to prioritise yourself… FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

What kind of things fill your cup??? ☕️ I'd love to hear it, no matter how exciting or mundane it is!! It might give someone else some ideas for ways they can fill theirs as they scroll through💡

Instead of freaking out about it all and letting myself get all anxious and stressed, I'm just doing one thing at a time and going down my checklist ✅ It can be super easy to just think about EVERYTHING that you need to do and letting the stress of that make you feel defeated before you even begin. But, I've found that just setting small goals and only focusing my energy on one task at a time is so much more efficient both physically and mentally. “You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step” - MLK Jr. 💯

Be with someone that genuinely loves to hear about your day, a person that looks you in the eye and tells you they love you. Be with someone that when you have a bad day, or become a little stress pot= will remind you that life is good and it'll be okay. Be with someone that isn't afraid of saying "I plan on being here for you every day for the rest of your life." Be with someone that pictures a home, children, future with you in it. Be with that one person that can't help but blurt out "you're so beautiful" when they look at you. Be with someone that surprises you... Excites you. Be with someone that respects you, communicates with you & won't shy away from a big old bear hug no matter who's around. Be with someone that makes you wonder what on earth you did to deserve someone that loves you this much.

it's actually not as simple as you think. it's not just one session, and done! and you now get to live your life skiing in the Alps and checking your phone x/day, while making millions of $$$

well, for some people, it's like that.

but for most others, reconnecting with their soul's purpose doesn't make their everyday LOOK much different but it changes how they FEEL about it.

finding your purpose gives you confidence to do what you love

it turns the everyday into extraordinary

it makes this body worth healing

it makes this life worth living.

it's not a one-size-fits-all and that's what makes the journey so powerful and unique for everyone!

i really just wanted to come in here and check in with you, say hello, you got this, you're perfect the way you are. you are CAPABLE because you have gone through some difficult things in your life in the past … and yet here you are.

some moments, i feel good just doing and being me, love myself, and feel empowered doing shit on my own, and other moments, i feel sad, lonely, uneasy, and it's harder to embrace all of me.

there's less distraction from my thoughts and more opportunity for any anxious or negative thoughts to start spiraling. BUT, if there's ever a time to give yourself grace, accept yourself, and take care of yourself, it is NOW.

there's a lot going on, and all that you are feeling is valid, but now isn't the time to give up on your self-love and self-acceptance journey. keep being kind to yourself, and keep putting in the work because you are still worthy no. matter. what.

you aren't necessarily busy, but you had a really stressful and long week and you just wanted to wind down and have an early night

that whole afternoon you dread the fact that you have to put on a face, help them out, and probably go to bed way later than you wanted

your patience at work is thinner than usual, although you are usually a kind and patient person

you would have loved to help them another time AND been happy about it, but you really needed some alone time to decompress…

____

anyone else been there? 🙋🏻‍♀️ this one way we tend to allow our own energy to leak & drain from the day

next time you feel this happening,
 
➡️ try this:

- realize that you can only give to others as much as you've given yourself. know that rest isn't lazy or selfish, it's IMPERATIVE to the way you can help your people. you know you'd like to help, but helping in a half-ass way doesn't feel good either.

- remember that another person's reaction to you saying yes or no is THEIR reaction. if they don't want to understand why you can't put aside energy for them (because you really have none left), it's not your fault nor responsibility. 🤷🏻‍♀️ take care of YOU!

- let them know honestly and kindly that you aren't available for that day. you can compromise by choosing another day or letting them know you'll reach out when you feel better. or if it's not something you want to do at all (even with more energy), let them know that you won't be able to help them, but maybe someone else can.

Doc ID: 9619, distribution: 1.0 ; you know what's cooler than always being there for other people in all the ways they need? always being there for yourself first and knowing you can't be everything to everyone.

just because you have the time to do something doesn't mean you have the energy for it. even though i usually no longer hesitate with saying "no" to people, i still sometimes feel guilty about it especially if it's a situation where i *could* say "yes" because i have the time, but choose to say "no" because i feel like i don't have the physical, mental, or emotional energy for it.

a reminder for myself and anyone else who struggles with this too: preserving your energy and protecting your peace are completely valid reasons for the decisions you make.

whenever you make a commitment to one thing, you are sacrificing another thing. i'm not saying don't ever do things with or for other people because fostering relationships is also an important part of creating a fuller life and doing what's best for you, but what i am saying is before you say "yes" to anyone or anything else (this also applies to things like working out, consuming social media and news content, agreeing to another work assignment, etc.), make sure you aren't saying "no" to yourself.

Doc ID: 2427, distribution: 1.0 ; My personality really went from 👹 THEN to 🥰 NOW… Anyone else feel like they don't even know the person they used to be anymore? HAHA the growth game is strong.

Q for you: do you feel like you take aligned action towards the things that matter to you, the life you dream of & the person you want to be? Answer honestly with a 🙋🏻‍♀️ or 🙅🏻‍♀️ below!

In all honesty, I used to be a pretty negative person. I tried so hard to fit in. I fed habits that didn't serve me AT ALL. I was reactive. I wasn't myself. I played small. I doubted myself. I tried to grow up so quickly. Had a negative relationship with food & my body. Put myself down. Gave into peer pressure. Spent time with people who didn't bring out the best in me. Compared myself constantly. Got mad all the time, and felt bad all the time.

But that's all part of learning about yourself, right? You learn from your mistakes, you get a sense of what does & doesn't feel like 'you'. You start setting boundaries, attracting YOUR people, knowing your worth, doing more of what makes you feel good & start living your life on YOUR terms. You also usually outgrow really bad haircuts HAHA.

If you're not where you want to be right now, just remember that you're in the perfect position for growth. You're learning every day. And you're always evolving, so you don't have to have it all figured out right now. I feel worlds apart from the person I was even just a few years ago, and I'm sure I'll say the same thing a few years from now about my current self. But at the end of the day, I'm so grateful for every version of me, because I wouldn't be the person I am today without HER 🫶

Doc ID: 9454, distribution: 0.4563665932764049 ; last week, i unexpectedly lost one of the most important and present people in my life, my 外公.

my grandpa moved to america a couple days before i was born and was here for me as a constant source of love, strength, and joy for over  years. having lived in cleveland my whole life at this point, i feel so fortunate to have been able to spend a lot of time with family. while i feel very grateful to have gotten more time than many people do with my grandpa, there's so many activities, celebrations, milestones that just won't be the same without his presence.

the hardest part of experiencing grief the past few days has been facing a lot of feelings of guilt and regrets for all the things i could've said or could've done to show my grandpa i love him and make the most of my time with him.  i can only hope that he knew that i cared about him and appreciated all his small efforts and try my best to move forward, to remember how precious life is with every human interaction, and to give myself and others grace. i share this because grief is hard and uncomfortable to feel and to talk about, but it's also very real and something all of us experience at some point in our lives.

no matter what pain or hardships you are going through, it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to take time to feel your feelings, it's okay to do what you need to do for yourself. the rest of the world can wait.

i hope my grandpa rests easy, and his legacy lives on through many cherished memories and the strength he instilled in all the lives he touched. i love you, grandpa. you will forever be missed.

💃PHYSICAL WELL-BEING💃

Caring for your physical well-being is a crucial component of living in alignment with your purpose. 

When you are at your best physically, you have the energy and clarity to pursue your passions and make the most of each day. 

By taking care of your body, you set yourself up for success and ensure that you have the foundation you need to live a fulfilling life filled with purpose.

I work with my : clients to not only (re)discover their purpose in life, but to set up their daily routine to be able to receive and c o n t a i n their sacred mission.

They start to understand that the more clear and healthy our body is, the more aligned it is to receive the next steps to live your purpose!

I help career women up level their quality of life by gaining clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices and forward motion.

Doc ID: 8144, distribution: 1.0 ; the beginning of a new month brings a soft reminder to recenter, refocus, and readjust any discomforts from the previous one. take this time to set the tone for the next  days. make the changes that need to be made. are you happy? are you getting the most out of all areas of your life? it's important to focus on the conditions of life that solely impact you, but don't forget the gravity of relationships and their influence on your happiness as well. recent events in my life have reminded me of this. of how crucial it is to speak up and never hold back, especially with someone you love. in order to love someone fully, you need to show up for yourself first. don't close yourself off in fear of hurting someone else. so often we feel that the troubles we face are better off held in, that they'll simply dissolve if we never express them. take this as a sign to open up to someone you love even if you're afraid letting them in will send them away. what is meant to happen, will. relationships are another area of our lives that factor into our overall happiness. i always talk about putting yourself first, but i fear this advice only gets applied to situations where nobody else is involved. this isn't to say relationships require always putting yourself first (most of the time, it's actually the opposite), but it is a reminder to open up to others in order to find peace of mind. let this next month be a period of growth, and let the people you love in to share it with you.

The course that will teach you how to be better?

The certification that will solve all your problems?

The program that will guide you to all your answers?

If you are… let's pause all the looking 👀OUTWARD and bring your attention ➡️inward⬅️

If there are any outstanding tasks, chores, items on your list that you've been holding off on, that's your work.

The things you've been avoiding out of fear or discomfort?

That's your work.

All those ⬆️ above totally can bring you to the next level 

AND also calling your mom more often can elevate your life in such a nourishing way.

Sticking to an exercise program (that you probably already bought but never finished) can get you to a whole other level.

So if you've been reaching for things outside yourself to level up,

Maybe it's time to reach within. And work on your basics.

i've had minimal motivation in the kitchen...and most other things in life lately, and you know what? that's okay.

this season of life is hard. i sit in an uncomfortable high chair at my kitchen island  hours a day trying my best to do work. i hardly leave my apartment ever. i feel like i'm repeating the same days over and over. i don't interact with many people. i simultaneously have a lot to do and nothing to do. i keep pushing things off. i'm exhausted.

there's a lot for me to be grateful for, and i'm so proud of myself for everything i've been through, but sometimes life just feels hard, and that's OKAY too. we are allowed to feel real human emotions because we are human beings just doing our freaking best to make it in this crazy world.

productivity may look different these days, but that doesn't make any of us any less worthy or capable.

some affirmations for me (and maybe for you too):

i embrace myself and all the things that make me who i am.

i am on my own path. there is no being behind when the only person on this path is me.

i have enough, and i am enough.

i do not seek perfection. my mistakes are signs of growth and exploration.

i have time to become all that i am meant to be.

i am capable of doing hard things.

i am so rooted in who i am that no one and nothing can disturb my peace.

*drumroll because its such a mystery and you've never heard this one before in your life😜*

myself.

𝑰 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒅 𝒎𝒚𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒇 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌

because 𝑰 was scared to make the “wrong” choice

𝑰 was nervous about what people would think about me

𝑰 didn't want to let my parents down

𝑰 didn't want the time i spent in school/training/internship to go to waste

𝑰 wanted to make sure i was on the CORRECT path

but what 𝑰 really needed was to build trust in myself, my decisions, and my ability to catch myself when i fell.

𝑰 needed support, clarity, and guidance from my own inner compass.

once i realized i was the missing piece in all of these, it all clicked.

If you have the feeling that something needs to change, you know deep down that taking a leap will make even a short life worth living. 

So this is the time to get really honest about where you are, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 to be very compassionate with yourself, as this is not an easy spot to be in.

Doc ID: 2498, distribution: 1.0 ; Swipe through for my full interview from @studioau today + some BTS!! 🙈

To think that a few years ago I had such low self-esteem I was too scared to leave the house, get a job, get my license, or say yes to invitations.

Believing in yourself changes everything.

You can't hate yourself into a version you love. You can't negatively criticise yourself & tell yourself you're not good enough & expect yourself to become confident or happy in your being.

That has to come from a place of love. 

Truthfully, I caught myself yesterday saying “I don't think I can do this” and in saying that, I was CLAIMING that belief… I was crippling myself. I realised that thought was one I'd had many times growing up. One that held me back, limited me, stopped me from growing & going after the life I knew was possible for myself.

So instead, I started reminding myself:
“I am courageous and brave
I don't have to be 'perfect', I just have to give it a go
I can do this
I take ownership of my life
I can do scary things
My discomfort is temporary
I am more than capable
I trust myself
I've got this”
and with those thoughts, I started feeling so much lighter, calmer & more clear-headed.

Self-belief & self-trust has changed my life. It's given me the opportunity to have my dream job, to do what gives me purpose & so much passion each day. It's inspired me to put my true self out there to all of you & say YES to a live interview on National TV. 

Repeat after me: a negative thought does not service me. I welcome the good because I am worthy of it!! 💪

The world really is your oyster, when you believe it 🥲

This morning I found another online scam using my “Real Me Monday” images as fake transformation photos with false outcomes for their own personal gain 💰

Instead of allowing these external pressures impact the way we view ourselves & push us further away from respecting our bodies, let's lean into showing ourselves love instead. 

I've been thinking about love languages recently & how my love language used to be primarily words of affirmation… Yet the way I ALWAYS spoke to myself was incredibly harsh. This got me thinking…

What's your love language?

I want to encourage you to do something for yourself that services the way you give & receive love. For e.g. if the way you feel love the most is through words of affirmation, but you constantly speak to yourself negatively, it's no wonder you feel terrible about yourself. That's destructive to your mindspace & confidence. Be mindful of your self-talk. You don't deserve all of the mean things you say to yourself.

If your love language is gifts, pick yourself some flowers or get your nails done 💐 if it's quality time, take yourself on a solo date or have a long, relaxing bath 🛁 if it's acts of service, romanticise your to-do list, put on some music, make your space clean & then sit back with a book & enjoy your fresh, cozy space. If it's physical touch… you know what to do 😉 OR perhaps you can do your skincare routine or book yourself a professional massage. These are just a few ways you can show yourself love 💗 

In the wise words of Miley Cyrus:
🎶 I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
& I can hold my own hand
I can love me better than you can 🎶 

Give yourself some of the love you always give to others 💗

Happy Real Me Monday 👑 p.s. my kinis are from @remmiebyriley (not an ad)

Mmm yes, and no. 

🦋share with a friend who needs to hear this🦋

Just because you've found (or rather, rediscovered) your big WHY, doesn't mean life won't shift.

One day you'll be living your person as an office clerk.

Next, you'll be running the corporation.

Then you might end up quitting and start writing a book.

You might decide that you want to learn how to do pottery and fall in love with the way the clay falls under your hands and the way your hand moves over the clay in fluid dance.

In all of those iterations, the thing that remains constant is not the way your purpose, your dharma, your soul's calling, LOOKS.

The constant in all of this is YOU at the center of it all. Grounded, anchored, & tethered to the flavor that YOU bring to the world in everything you do.

🦋Flourish With Purpose is my -month coaching program, created to help career women  with big dreams get un-stuck, out of their own way, and into alignment with their life's purpose. limited spots available for start in April!

Doc ID: 9526, distribution: 0.4540499768847085 ; i can't even tell you how long i've spent seeking validation from others, including people I don't even know, before seeking validation from myself.

i thought there was a “correct” way to go through life because i was given guidelines by society and the people around me when the truth is, there is no “correct” way to go through a life that solely belongs to you.

you are the main character of your life, and you only live this life once. no matter how you live it, people will judge you and try to change you, but if you ignore your intuition and allow them to alter your path, you're going to end up being a distorted version of yourself living somebody else's life. your authentic self is so much more powerful than any other version of you, and finding your way back to yourself is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding journeys of your lifetime.

please love yourself more than you love the idea of other people loving you.  it's never too late to come back home. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8651, distribution: 0.2677785103123914 ; I've said it before & i'll say it again and probably more after this…

Your process IS your progress.

Whatever you work on for yourself today is ultimately part of that big goal, that dream life, that big vision.

You really have all the things you need to get started today.

We look for so much external validation to tell us that we're going in the right direction,

To tell us that we've “progressed,”

When we ALSO can internally validate ourselves.

You don't have  to wait until you land that dream job that checks every box for you, feels fulfilling, and that also makes you enough money to live life comfortably and go on  vacations a year.

(this is possible for you BTW)

Did you go on that walk today? Did you speak kindly to yourself today? Did you make the effort to go to bed earlier today?

You make your own measures, your own goals. 

once you stop striving for “progress” and start enjoying the focus on your “process,”

You'll see your life flourish.

You got this. I love you.

some days are super fast-paced, and some days are super slow. some days, i wake up feeling like a superhero, and some days, i question my ability to take on the day. some days, i feel so many positive emotions, and some days, i feel a lot of really difficult emotions. the difference between now and in the past is that now, no matter what kind of day it is, i choose to accept myself and what IS no. matter. what.

this weekend has had a lot of highs, but also some lows which is normal and okay. immensely grateful for all the things that brought me smiles this weekend AND for my journey that has allowed me to feel content even on lower “off” days like today.

i know that i'm not everyone's cup of tea, but to be honest, i don't really care anymore. i don't always love all of me, but i choose to accept and embrace myself every day. i give myself kindness ALWAYS because at the end of the day, the one person who will be there for me no matter what, is ME, and if I get to CHOOSE whether i want to be my best friend or my enemy, i'm going to choose to be my best friend because I'm the moments that i fail, get really down, or notice something i don't like about myself (it happens to the best of us), i'd much rather have the voice in my head tell me words of kindness and understanding rather than judgement and criticism.

🥾“I wish I chose a different life path.”

🖇“I wish I didn't take this job.”

ESPECIALLY if you see your friends or people that you know, or maybe people on Facebook loving the life that they chose. 

Here's a reframe to try out:  ✨There is something in that contrast that you would like for your own life. ✨

It's actually a blessing to have that feeling because it confirms there's something you actually want.

Your work is in learning how to shift your current life, into the life that you want to live. 

If you can see these comparisons as enlightening tools for you to identify what you want in your life vs. seeing them as “something I'll never have and I'm stuck with the lesser option,”

🦋I promise you, things in your life will start changing.🦋

You are in charge and can break through the barriers in your way.

real talk, yesterday, i had negative thoughts and feelings about my body and self rise up, and it felt both familiar and unfamiliar to me at the same time. i've gotten to a place where my previous EDs feel very distant and detached from who i am now, yet, i had a moment where a negative voice that i associate with my EDs crept in.  the difference now compared to when i was still recovering though is that now, i don't even give that voice the time of day. i'm able to step back and see that these negative thoughts only come when other things in my life are more chaotic or stressful, and i know that even just listening to them does only harm and zero good.
——
tbh, i debated sharing that i had these feelings come up because i want to show that fully healthy relationship with food and your body is possible! but, i also want to be real and transparent and let you know that i still have hard days because struggling and being imperfect is what makes us human! recovery doesn't mean never ever having bad body and self image days ever again because having inner turbulence is what helps us to continue to grow.  rather, recovery to me means being able to let go, step back, observe, accept, use the tools in your back pocket, and continue to transform even when everything feels out of control.

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others?

-
So I have a few different fears, and this is definitely one of them. I'd also say that this fear has only grown in recent years as I've discovered more about life, thought more about what I want to achieve and what there is to explore out there (short answer: there's a lot!!!) 🙈😳
-
Now before I say anything else, no matter where you are in your life right now, no matter what you're doing, whether you're happy or sad, comfortable or uncomfortable, moving fast or slow . . . let me remind you that you are *not* wasting life. And with fears, you cannot let them cripple you or get the better of you, because it's just not worth it.
-
Instead, what you can try and do is learn to love a fear (strange, I know 🤷🏻‍♀️😅) or use it in a positive way. So my fear of 'wasting life' helps me when I'm feeling a bit down or stuck in a rut. It's what helps me wake up in the mornings when all I want to do is sleep, it constantly pushes me to seek new challenges and drives me to want to never stop exploring 🌎

Life really is precious, something incredibly special, and it's there to be maximised! The sky shouldn't even be your limit 😉

You don't need to know how.

You don't need to know the exact steps right now.

The first step is to have some mental flexibility to say “yes i believe there are possibilities for this life i have been dreaming of”

“Yes, the resources and the support I need to get there exist somewhere in the world.”

“Yes, I think if i really applied myself to it, i could do it.”

Once you do this, 

Once you have DECIDED that you might be able to attain your desires (which are actually going to help the world),

It will start to unfold because it's meant to. 

Don't just take my word for it…. Try it for yourself and watch what happens.

And prepare yourself for that dream life to start making it's way to you.

You got this. I love you.

Doc ID: 8708, distribution: 0.26718298129857304 ; living a / life isn't just for the IG travel models or business execs who have  hour work weeks. 

an exciting, fulfilling life is available for anyone willing to do the inner work & let go of these things: ⬇️

❌not leaning into and sharing your passions

❌believing that making the “wrong” choice will ruin everything 

❌feeling unworthy of your deepest desires

❌thinking you need to do something you don't enjoy forever

❌not allowing yourself to imagine an exciting life

a life you love is not dependent on your income, your job status, your living situation, your current phase of life, etc. 

you can be living your purpose as you clock into your -

you can be living your purpose as you work on a project until  am 

you can be living your purpose as you call your bestie & tell her about your day

it's just up to you to decide not just IF you want to change, but WHEN.

———-

if you are ready to finally live a life that you're extremely satisfied and content with, let's chat!

I help women gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices and forward motion.

Doc ID: 9603, distribution: 1.0 ; reminders to stop comparing yourself to others and caring so much about what others think!

YOU WILL NEVER BE FOR EVERYONE- some people like their coffee black, some like it with cream, some like it iced, some like it hot, and some people don't like it at all. you might not be for everyone, but you can  always work on accepting yourself.

YOU DON'T SEE THE FULL PICTURE- you don't know what internal struggles other people are going through. you don't see what people are or aren't doing outside of the moments you see. on social media and in real life, you never see the full reality of other people's lives, but you see all of your own.

WISH OTHER PEOPLE THE BEST- you might not see what other people are dealing with behind the scenes, but you can still wish them happiness. if someone is celebrating an accomplishment, you can wish them happiness without beating yourself up for not accomplishing the same. if someone is showing their healthy lifestyle changes, you can wish them health and happiness without feeling like you need to make the same changes they are. “you can admire someone else's garden while still watering and admiring your own”.

PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND HOW YOU FEEL- do you find yourself comparing and feeling pressured when you're on social media? set boundaries with it and take breaks. do certain accounts make you feel worse about yourself? protect yourself, and mute, unfollow, or block accounts that aren't serving you (you can always undo this). do certain people make you feel appreciated and comfortable being your authentic self? spend more time with them.

BUILD YOURSELF UP SO YOU DON'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU- other people's opinions of you, positive or negative, are none of your business. be kind to yourself, spend time with yourself, learn to accept yourself, and treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend because at the end of the day, you're what you've got, so YOUR opinion of you matters way more than other's.

there's other people's expectations and society's standards, but we get to make the rules for our own lives! i say we live it!!!

Doc ID: 7043, distribution: 0.502909715318766 ; going through a season of change with my body 🌱

finding what feels best for me during this chapter. asking myself how i can live my fullest life, and then making it my goal to do just that. aiming for feelings of peace, stability, strength, acceptance, and freedom. pursuing spontaneous plans and eats, yeses, and memories. more more more.

at times it's uncomfortable to move away from the familiar and into the unknown. from old clothes and into new ones. from a position of control and into one of receiving. 

it's hard but not impossible. it's hard but worth it. it's hard but it's also incredible, discovering and meeting this new version of myself. 

here are the healing phrases that ground me in moments of anxiety. when i begin to question whether or not to keep pushing, i speak these words to myself, to my body:

- ⚡️thank you
- ⚡️i'm on your side
- ⚡️i appreciate you
- ⚡️i respect you
- ⚡️i care for you
- ⚡️all discomfort is temporary
- ⚡️you are capable 
- ⚡️you are strong
- ⚡️food is my friend
- ⚡️movement is my friend
- ⚡️rest is my friend

the life i lead in my body is much more valuable than the appearance of my body itself. i'm grateful for what this body allows me to do. for the experiences i live through this shape.

Doc ID: 8681, distribution: 0.27033303228377603 ; my love language is helping you win😍

ask any of my closest people - one of the many ways i show love for them is to remind them of their gifts, talents, and genius.

i've always had a hard time saying things just for fluff (my double aquarius is showing again…)

✨but when it comes to recognizing your gifts and how much change you can bring to the world once you tap into them… i am right THERE next to you.✨

i love my clients.

they are the best.

they are the ones who decided to take a chance on them and transform their lives.

they are the most brave, heart-led people i know.

and it is a big honor that i get to play a role in their growth.

i wouldn't necessarily say i'm “obsessed” (just to clarify that i am not unhealthily attached lol), but i am driven and constantly inspired by you.

a big reason why i 

✅hold myself to a high standard, 

✅want to emotionally regulate better everyday, 

✅ continue implementing new modalities that help me feel more excited about life is because…

💃my clients deserve it.

you deserve a coach who is invested in your growth just as much (or more) as you are, but only you can decide.

i am taking a few more multi-passionate, multi-talented, multi-faceted women for my limited seat program, Flourish with Purpose, which starts in April.

if you feel called, send me a DM! or tap the link in my bo to watch a  min video about my program and how we can grow together!

Doc ID: 8679, distribution: 0.26495681330646476 ; i would NEVER have imagined that i would willingly choose to: not go to med school, live with my parents (lol), and be a coach??

 year old me was ambitious, determined, hard working, and so studious, she would just tell me to shut up if i went back in time and told her what i was doing.

she had PLANS to change the world. and i love her for that.

the problem was that i  tied my identity, worthiness, and capabilities to those plans. 

and when the plans started to feel less exciting (internal compass started shifting), i felt so alone and lost.

thankfully, i found my path once again.

i learned that being “on my path” is not dependent on any one thing that i've accomplished

but more so the intention of my creations

my purpose.

so it didn't matter that my life “measures” at  didn't match the life that i planned or expected.

what mattered at the end is that i was brave enough to be true to myself.

and i know you are, too.

Doc ID: 8710, distribution: 0.2807605816813331 ; these things can realllyyyy hold you back from going for your purpose (are you doing any of them?)👇🏼

- expecting to be paid from their purpose 

- making sure everyone is happy with your life shifts

- not wanting to make a wrong choice… so you don't make any at all and perpetuate feeling stuck

- thinking that your sensitivity and empathy is a WEAKNESS, so you hide it and don't explore what it can actually do for you.

- forcing a path because it “seems” right, not because you truly FEEL in your body that it is the right move.

maybe this doesn't resonate with you right now (AMAZING!! congrats ❤️) but i know you can tag a friend who has been stuck in their current situation lately.

If you use proper tags i think the eating disorder community would like to see relatable art about ed. Just be mindful of the tags: depending on its context I would or would not put it in the recovery tagIn the end its up to you. I will always encourage sharing all forms of art, but i understand the need for privacy as well.

 Please like or reblog this if you are a personal ED recovery blog.

My stand on “pro-ana” 
 I don't know if anyone cares enough to read this, but I want to get this off my chest, as I've seen a lot of posts about this topic floating around. Please remember before cursing me out, this is just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me.  
 You are not pro-ana if  
you're posting or reblogging tips
you're posting or reblogging thinspo
you're answering asks 
 You are pro-ana if  
you wish this mental illness upon someone else
you tell people they are fat and should starve themselves 
you actively encourage other people to develop an eating disorder 
you think eating disorders are a good thing and more people should have one 
 I have never seen anyone in this community do the things I consider pro-ana on here. We know that we are sick and I bet you my green tea collection that there is nobody on here that wishes this upon anyone else.  


 Disagree. If you reblog unhealthy tips, you are sharing them with your followers. That is spreading that specific mindset and you never know who is vulnerable, or already pushing their body to its absolute limit. Asks are the same. Don't share tips, calorie limits, etc. Especially because these will be seen directly by a specific other person. Tl;dr don't be an ass and make other people's disorders worse. Intention doesn't mean SHIT in that situation, impact does. “Oh I wouldn't wish this on anyone else but hey here's a way to lose  lbs in a week just chop off your legs” 

 this just in: ana tips are literally just pro ana tips 
 “INTENTION DOESNT MEAN SHIT - IMPACT DOES”

If anon wants me to expand on a point, they can send another ask in. I don't owe anyone an essay in response to a question. Sometimes I choose to write more and sometimes I don't.If you send me a question on anon, there is no need to be scared of the reply because nobody will know it came from you. You can even use it as an exercise in developing resilience. I don't mean that patronisingly because I have done it myself and become much more able to deal with anon negativity you message me about something and feel that I am jumping down your throat in response because you accidentally wrote the wrong thing or I took it in a different way to what you meant, you can message me again with a clarification and we can resolve it.You can message me off-anon and I will reply with the respect that someone who is brave enough to make themselves known deserves. In the meantime, anyone who hides behind a grey face to message me, has to accept that they will get the answer they get.

Me seeing a person eat: yeah stuff your face fatass!  
 Okay, you know what, I see your posts, and posts like this a lot about EDs in the actuallybpd tag that border on encouraging EDs, but this is just fucked up.  
 This is beyond your eating disorder, this is you being a cruel, fatphobic person. 
 You didn't have to post this, let alone in the actuallybpd tag, a tag FULL of people who struggle with weight issues who might be triggered by this stuff. Don't tag this with things like “mental disorder” to try and act like you can blame this on your mental health. This is all on you.  
 I see fucking thinspo and meanspo posts all the time in the actuallybpd tag, a lot from YOU specifically, and I'm sick of it. If you're gonna be toxic, keep it in your own fucking spaces. 


 the actuallybpd tag is a joke in itself. what, because the people claiming “just bpd” arent authentic enough? you're *actually bpd, not like those other ppl claiming bpd. how special. half of the people on this “achktualleh” tag are probably self diagnosed, and more than half of them are under  and theres still controversy as to whether or not bpd is even an appropriate diagnosis for a teenager. this whole op is a shit show. if you're gonna be a repeat offender perpetuating fatphobic proana bullshit please just delete your account. i hope you think about this post the next time you're stuffing your face, @afraidformyselfagain lmaooo. you're so afWaiD for yourself that you're tryna drag strangers down with you? foh

Or does it just feel like an attack? Just wondering - I think some people try to call you out to help and some just to make themselves feel better, but was just wondering if it had ever been something constructive for you?? Answer: Sometimes there's something useful in there or some niggle of truth in what they say when they're calling me out, so yes it can be constructive in that way. Sometimes I can see why they're saying what they're saying. Often I feel that they don't fully understand the aspect of my life they're commenting on, which is understandable because I can only convey so much in a text post on tumblr. Then I catch myself and think that when I was deep in my eating disorder, I dismissed everything that everyone was saying - that's classic eating disorder behaviour. So then I check myself and look for the truth in what's being said.Some anons just seem out to make themselves feel better by firing off a rant, and even when that feels it's sent as an attack, I don't tend to take it personally. I appreciate it probably touched a nerve in them for them to decide to send me a message.I can only think of once or twice when anons have been really malicious and basically just trolls out to cause mischief with their messages. I don't publish those ones, I just hit that delete button.

Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same.

We are constantly arguing about how much they are struggling "adulting" and managing their money. Most of them just started living on their own, when I have been for yrs, and all make more money and have lower bills but all constantly have to get help or have like $ to their name. It's getting to the point I don't want to talk to them anymore because it's so frustrating. Help tumblr mom!  Answer: Ah that's tough anon, you are in a different life space to your friends. Living independently is a big shock and there's lots to get used to, and you do feel like you've got too much to do and no money, plus having to do all those boring routine adulting things. Living on your own for six years, you are several steps ahead of them in independence and experience. Stuff your friends are struggling with will probably have become things you can do without thinking now, and then it can be difficult to remember how much energy just basic living took up when you started out.Only you can decide whether your friendships can get through this. Can you spend time together without talking about money or adulting? You don't need to fix all their situations. Or maybe you need to try and meet new friends that fit more with the phase of life you're in. Friendships often do move around as we move through different stages of life, we drift apart from some friends and become closer to others. Some friendships survive the varying stages of life, by focusing on what they have in common or being willing to listen to each other's struggles even if we can't really appreciate the situation the other one is in.You probably can't change your friends or their struggles, so the ball is in your court. If it really feels too frustrating to keep seeing them, then you can gently pull away - maybe even only temporarily. If you do keep seeing them, then I think you just have to find a way to accept that these are their struggles right now and they're valid, just as your struggles in the place you're in are also valid. Some people feel they're the worst off, no matter how much you feel that they aren't. It's hard to talk someone out of that place so better just to love them in it if you can.

And its not all crap as you would think.
The important thing is following recovery accounts that are genuine and real that dont sneak in their thinness or have an illusion of recovery while remaining underweight. That shit is fake as hell and only damages the recovery of vulnerable viewers. You dont have to follow a triggering account just because they use the recovery tag.

When people share their personal stories and struggles (rather than just endless reblogs), I get to know them and care about how their lives go. I'm not going to share a list of blog names because I invariably miss someone out and then feel terrible, but it doesn't take much looking around, looking at who likes my posts, etc to see who I interact with.

LOL. right. it sucks bc ur trying to decide whether you should hold shit against them or not. bc on one hand theyre neglecting the friendship, but on the other hand people get busy and its not fair to hold being too busy against them. u CAN hold being an absent friend against them tho. busy or not, ppl who care make time for one another. ppl who care make an effort to listen to how you're doing.. i miss my friends sometimes too, lol. havent talked to my childhood best friend in over a year now. but its for the best. i was patient with them n they all disappointed me. people grow apart naturally, if thats whats happening, try not to let it eat u alive. it means you're evolving, even if you're the one stuck at home. im sorry u feel so isolated right now. its not a fun way to feel. the best advice i can give is to focus on refining urself for the time being. keep urself busy becoming a better person. friends come and go and we all evolve/outgrow people but the next time a friend comes along, you could be the difference in their life. you could be the friend for that person that you've been needing all this time. you can be the empathetic ear that makes the time for them, and listens when they need you to. if you can do this for other ppl, it might make u feel a lil better.. and they might return the friendship. dont expect much, tho. ppl r fickle pickles. i try n befriend coworkers n stuff bc it makes me feel better. ppl like to be listened to so if i can just like listen to my coworkers and i mean RLY listen and offer support, they LOVE that and it makes ppl love u, yano. people dont always return the favors, you might not always have someone to go to, but at least you know you're giving everyone everything you can. you can be your own friend. theres knowledge and wisdom and power in silence. you just gotta get a bit more comfortable with it. being alone isnt the worst thing in the world, especially when you have a vivid interior to keep yourself amused. im glad my blog makes u feel a little better and i hope ur able to feel peaceful n calm this week, hang in there buddy

That hospital didn't have any groups or activities during the day and we weren't allowed in our rooms unless we were sleeping. They also didn't have psychiatrists or therapists. Basically there was one large room where all the patients sat together and watched tv all day. That hospital was pretty bad. The one I'm in now is supposedly the best psychiatric hospital in the US. I've been to this inpatient unit three times now and it's very nice compared to the other one. Our day is very structured and we have different activities we can go to (but we're not forced to). We have several groups each day like CBT, DBT, ACT, art therapy, walks, music, and more. We are also assigned a psychiatrist and a social worker to coordinate everything while we're there and also aftercare planning. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Doc ID: 19559, distribution: 0.22646835105943916 ; Day  of inpatient was kind of weird but not necessarily in a bad way. I didn't sleep well so I was up early. We didn't have anything scheduled in the morning so I did my laundry, cleaned my room, changed my sheets, and hung up pictures and posters. It was a very productive morning but I was also really anxious. I had a doctor's appointment outside of the hospital so I got to go on pass for that. It was weird being off the unit and around so many people. I've been really anxious lately and I don't know why.

Doc ID: 19824, distribution: 0.3157191267457161 ; Day  of inpatient was bad but there were some happy moments too. The morning was pretty rough. The racist and homophobic and transphobic and anti Semitic guy was complaining about me and my friends even though all we did was walk past him. He accused us of taunting him and trying to provoke him. Then he started calling my friend “the bitch who looks like a heroin addict” and that was the last straw. I walked out of the room we were in and stood across from him (with staff in between) and yelled at him and called him a “fucking bigot” and then staff got mad at me and escorted me to a different wing of the hospital. It was also Chinese New Year today so my parents visited and brought Chinese food and that was nice. I'm just angry and frustrated and the people here are really great (for the most part) but it's just hard when you're stuck around the same people for so long and there aren't many lounges or places to go. I hope tomorrow will have less drama. Maybe they'll only have to call security once as opposed to the three times they called today.

Doc ID: 19281, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I got my off unit privileges back so I was able to go on the walks and that was really nice. My mood wasn't great today and I struggled a lot. Staff was really helpful and coached me through some skills. I'm a little anxious as the weekend approaches because those are usually hard for me but I'm hoping for the best.

Doc ID: 19860, distribution: 0.878436812864096 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I distracted myself for most of the day so my mood was okay. I wrote some more stuff and spent time with friends and my aunt came to visit. I let the staff read my writing and it was really scary but I think it's a step in the right direction. They've been telling me that it's helped them understand me better because I'm not always comfortable saying how I'm feeling out loud. Writing is just easier for me and it feels good to let it out.

Doc ID: 19575, distribution: 0.26021794265387105 ; Question: I'm always curious about people's inpatient stays because I've never gone but feel like sometimes I might need to but I never know how to get there or what to say :/ Have all of your stays been from a section? Or did you bring yourself there? How long has each one been? How do you know when you need to leave? Have you ever wanted to leave but they said no or wanted to stay and they made you leave? Sorry for all the questions :( Answer: Hi! You don't have to apologize for asking questions. I don't mind answering them and I have nothing else to do. I didn't really have a choice with any of my hospitalizations but technically only one of my stays was because of a section. Basically my therapist asked me if I would agree to go or if she would have to “pink slip” me, which is what they call it in Ohio. I agreed to go and they took me to the ER and the ER sectioned me even though I said I would go inpatient. The other three hospitalizations have been voluntary on paper but in those situations it was more of a “you can agree to go or we will make you go” so it wasn't really that voluntary. It just shows up differently on your records. My first hospitalization (the pink slip one) was only  hours. That hospital was terrible so I lied my way out of there (I do not recommend doing this because I just ended up getting hospitalized a month later). The second hospitalization was about a month and a half. The third one was about two weeks. The current hospitalization is two months and counting. I don't really know how I know when I need to leave. I don't particularly want to be here but my treatment team determines when I am ready to leave. I really don't have any say in any of that. I could sign a three-day, which would mean that they have three business days to evaluate whether or not I need to stay and they will either discharge you or section you. I was told that I would just get sectioned if I try to sign one so I'm not going to bother. I have wanted to leave many times and they won't let me. I've never wanted to stay and been kicked out because they would be liable if anything happened to me after discharge.

My parents insisted on visiting and I wasn't too thrilled about that and it made me anxious. I was able to make it through the visit thanks to my friends who acted as buffers. My friends and I did puzzles and played games for the rest of the evening and it was fun. Today was the first day I've been here where I wasn't completely overwhelmed by my anxiety and depression. I was also able to get myself to eat more than usual and I'm proud of myself for that.

I had some good conversations with staff and that was nice. I'm hoping that my meeting with my treatment team goes well tomorrow. I have some things I want to talk about and I hope that they're willing to listen bc sometimes it feels like they just dismiss me.

I had a phone call with the department of mental health and that made me feel worse. I slept for most of the morning just to avoid everything. I spent the afternoon with friends and some friends from school visited me. I also had to deal with some invalidating stuff about my gender and that made me more upset. It was just a bad day. I'm glad I got to see my friends though. I'm also glad that I have friends on the unit who support me.

One of my closest friends left and that was really hard. I cried for a bit but then distracted myself with more drawing. I was able to hold it together tonight and I hope it lasts but I'm not so confident that it will. Today is my three month anniversary of being here and it's hard to believe it's been that long. It feels like a long time but also a short time. Typing out the number “” was kinda scary but I guess that's my reality. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22204, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was the best one yet! I got moved up to level three, which means my dogs can visit me and I can get passes to leave the unit. The highlight of my day was seeing all three of my dogs and getting to walk them around the hospital grounds. I ate a lot of food today and I'm proud of myself for that. I struggled a little after but I forced myself to stay in open areas and used some of the coping mechanisms I've learned here. Overall, it was a really great day and I'm so grateful for the staff and my safety.

Doc ID: 19960, distribution: 1.0 ; Admit day and day  of inpatient were not great but they started to get better. Admit day was pretty awful and there wasn't much to do. I spent most of the day in the clinical evaluation center and I didn't really talk to anyone. I mostly stayed in my room. Day  was okay. I struggled with self harming and stayed in my room for the first half. I didn't do great with eating either. I started to meet more people toward the end of the day and that's been really nice. I like everyone and it's making my time here easier.

I like greeting the new patients and helping them get used to the routine. I went to a bunch of groups today and that was good. My friends later in the day and it was nice to see them. Then my friends and I got bubble tea delivered and I shot the boba through the straw at people. Overall it was a good day. I have a family meeting tomorrow and I'm nervous about that. I'll try to post some of my writing tomorrow. I just need to figure out how to post it bc the entries/essays are like two pages. Idk let me know if you have any ideas.

Doc ID: 19812, distribution: 0.25868131970196456 ; Day  of inpatient was very mixed. I woke up in a bad mood and that got worse bc my doctor thinks I should go to a state hospital and that felt shitty. I just feel like they're giving up on me. My day got better and I went to a lot of groups so that was a good distraction. The day started to get worse when I was trying to explain racism and cultural appropriation and people weren't listening and we being defensive. I got frustrated and went back to my room and sent them a bunch of articles bc I do not have the energy to put in the emotional labor of educating people about racism. Then I got sent a bunch of apologetic texts and I felt like they just wanted me to absolve them of their white guilt. I was just very irritable today. I hope tomorrow is better.

I went to group and then on a walk and then hung out with my roommate. I had a visitor who brought me dinner and we played cards. Then I went to art group and talked to a staff member about musicals. Now I'm just chilling in my room. My mood was pretty okay and my anxiety was not great but not awful. Everything was manageable today and that's progress.

Doc ID: 19516, distribution: 0.303388671104278 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't very good. I got woken up early for tms and that put me in a bad mood. I was really groggy all morning and people kept trying to talk to me but apparently I wasn't very responsive. I was in bed basically all morning and I'm not even sure if I was fully conscious. I don't remember most of this morning but my nurse said that a bunch of staff members said I seemed out of it and was not communicating very well or at all. Honestly all I remember is that a few people came to check on me and I had brief conversations with them but I don't know what they said or what I said. I only know that they happened. I felt better later in the day and was more able to function. Then things got bad at night and I'm worried that my doctor will take away more privileges. I guess we'll see.

I woke up late and went back to bed immediately after meeting with the weekend doctor and taking care of ADLs. My dogs were going to visit today but I got dropped a level bc of self harm and other stuff so they couldn't come. That made me upset so I stayed in bed for the whole day shift and barely talked to anyone. I had a visitor and that was nice. My day started to get better after that. I spent the rest of the day playing games with friends and that was fun.

Doc ID: 19891, distribution: 0.5516552953385211 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. The morning and afternoon weren't great. I slept in late and didn't go to many of the groups. I stayed in my room for a lot of the day and I had really bad anxiety for most of it. One of the other patients was yelling at the staff and kicking things and men yelling is a trigger for me so that was difficult. Things got a lot better at night. I spent time with my friends and with staff and it was just really fun and a nice distraction. It's weird how normal things feel here. Sometimes I forget that I'm in a psych hospital.

Doc ID: 19786, distribution: 0.3188587872731559 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. I was in a really good mood this morning bc my friend shipped me my chest binder and it felt really good to wear it. I met with my treatment team and they said that I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Also my insurance company denied tms treatment but the doctor said he would do it for free. A lot of my friends (patients) left today and I'm happy for them but I'll miss them. It's also hard to see so many people come here after me and leave before me. I spent a lot of the day crying bc so many people were leaving. It was my favorite staff member's last shift tonight and that was super hard for me. She was the first staff member I met and the first one I trusted. It's bittersweet bc I know that she's moving on to a better job but I'm going to miss her so much.

My aunt and my parents visited and it didn't go well. It was fine with my aunt but my parents said that I would have to pay for residential treatment. I was already having a bad depression day and that just made me feel worse. I already feel like a burden to them and that just made me feel bad.

Things continued to get worse and it got really bad after my family visited. It was just a bad visit and I feel like they don't understand mental illness and they aren't trying to learn about it and they're just not very supportive in general. I stayed in my room after the visit and struggled a lot with self harm and suicidal thoughts. I eventually left my room (after several hours) and spent some time with my friends. We had a really fun time and it cheered me up a lot. Today was one of my hardest days out of all of my hospitalizations but tonight was also one of the best nights I've had in a long time. I'm trying to focus on that.

Doc ID: 19288, distribution: 0.6566843252889472 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I am trying to appreciate the little things and I think I have become less critical when it comes to rating my days here. The past few days were really rough for me and I honestly hit a low point. Before this weekend I would have said that today was shitty but now in comparison it was a good day. I got off of one to one supervision and I can't express how amazing it felt to be able to use the bathroom and take a shower without someone watching me the entire time. I was still restricted to one hallway but I was allowed to go to groups and staff members and patients were allowed to talk to me. Two days in complete isolation was very difficult for me and I'm so happy to be done with that. I'm hoping to gain back some more privileges tomorrow. I'm going to try really hard to make healthy choices for myself and making those choices has always been a big struggle for me.

The weekends here are kinda quiet and there isn't much to do so I spent a lot of time just sitting around. My friend and her mom came to visit and that was fun. The afternoon and evening were tough for me. I'm still struggling with self harm and eating. They tried to get me to drink ensure but I really don't like the taste so I didn't drink it. I was eventually able to force myself to eat some pizza so that's progress. My mood was pretty low today but hopefully it'll get better soon.

Doc ID: 21961, distribution: 0.2370391352419602 ; Question: i don't know how to ask this but did you go there willingly? what's it like? i need help and i'm scared  Answer: Hey! Making a decision about whether to go to the hospital is really tough and scary. It's a very personal decision and know that the staff there will be there to support you and keep you safe. It's hard to ask for help but you are so worth it and there are people who love you and care about you. Ultimately, going willingly is generally better because you want to be engaged in your treatment but it's also okay if you don't go willingly. Try not to feel ashamed about how you end up in the hospital and focus more on your recovery and moving forward. The first time I was hospitalized I went sort of willingly and sort of unwillingly. Basically, I was told by my achool's counseling center that I could go on my own or they would pink slip me (which basically means force me to go). I was then brought to the ER where I was formally pink slipped. This time, I was supposed to start a partial hospitalization program and the intake person suggested that I go inpatient instead. I agreed because I thought it would be best for me and I do not regret my decision.Each day follows the same basic structure but has different groups and activities. The first hospital didn't have groups so it was really boring. They try to keep us pretty busy here so we have groups and activities most of the day. The morning starts with breakfast at am and ends with wrap-up group at pm. I was pretty scared my first few days here but I've slowly adjusted and found my way. I've been here for quite some time now so I've gotten to know the staff and the other patients. We get a lot of free time and the groups and activities are never mandatory. They do take attendance and attendance is strongly encouraged but you're never forced to go. Unfortunately, it still gets boring around here even with the groups and activities. I've found that it's helpful to get to know the other patients because they get what you're going through and you can all support each other. I've met some really great people here and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to be at such a wonderful hospital. Please don't hesitate to send in more questions or DM me if that's easier for you. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I have plenty of time to do so.

Doc ID: 19642, distribution: 0.10974259645828252 ; Question: What happened during the meeting? I'm sorry about the family friend 😞 Answer: The meeting just made me really anxious because it was my social worker, my nurse, and the DMH representative all in the same room and the DMH lady was asking me a bunch of questions and I was too anxious to say anything so my nurse and social worker helped answer things and it was weird to hear them talking about me but I'm glad they were there to help. It also just kind of hit me how serious this is because I've been downplaying the severity of my symptoms and I'm so used to living like this that it feels normal even though it's really not. Basically everyone agreed that I'm not safe enough to step down to a less restrictive program or live at home and do outpatient stuff. My nurse and I also tried to explain that living at home with my parents is not a good idea and a residential program would be better but the DMH lady didn't seem to understand that. I just know that being at home with my parents would make my mental health worse. The goal is to keep me out of a state hospital and to be able to use DMH services (if they determine that I'm eligible, which hopefully they will). Unfortunately, I might not be approved and even if I do get approved, it takes a long time to put those services in place so I'm going to be stuck here for the foreseeable future. Idk the meeting kinda just made me feel more hopeless because I'm finally starting to realize how bad things really are and it's scary.

I had a fun time just doodling and drawing things for staff. I didn't feel great today but I was able to distract myself for most of the day. The night got really hard for me but my nurse helped me a lot so that's good.

Doc ID: 14338, distribution: 0.6594649442548014 ; Oh hey tumblr. My life is a mad blur just now. I really want to write posts about my last therapy session and the end of the one before but no time 😩 I will never again think taking just one newborn for a foster placement is busy. And if I ever even think about taking three siblings, I need someone to bash me over the head because I think it would finish me off. We are just about surviving with two, and they are the most darling children but have been through some hideousness which makes me want to scoop them up and run away with them so that they have absolutely no chance of being sent back to that situation.

Doc ID: 8879, distribution: 0.15671348507927052 ; we've had Kiara for almost a month and a half now and while she's growing physically, i feel like i'm growing a lot more mentally

as the youngest child in a big family, everyone took care of me. 

i'm used to just watching out for myself, meeting my own needs, and doing what i want on my schedule. 

it was a huge adjustment to constantly pay attention to another living beings needs, hunger/potty cues, and mannerisms. setting things/time aside for her, although different, has been very enjoyable at the end of the day. 

i love her snuggles, her zoomies, the way her eyes light up when she knows it's almost meal time, the way she gnaws at her teething toys, the way her tail wags, her tippy taps across the floor, and the way she twitches and barks in her sleep

when i'm mad at her i'm only acting like it… deep down i think everything she does is adorable but i can't let her think that 😅😅

 months ago i would have read this and been like “ok…. it's a dog Amanda….. 👀👀👀👀relax”

but NOW i TOTALLY get it. i can try, but i don't think i can even imagine the feeling of love a mother has for her own human child. i think my heart would explode on a daily basis😭😭

anyway, happy weekend! stay safe, enjoy, and also remember the people who didn't have independence on America's Independence Day… and the people who still don't.

Doc ID: 15349, distribution: 0.28766362195519773 ; Question: How many babies can you have at a time? Have you ever had twins? Answer: Officially we are approved for two placements, - years. So theoretically we could take two babies but we only have one cot and a rather full house already so we only take one except in exceptional circumstances. We did emergency care for  month old twins earlier this year for three days. And last summer we did holiday care for a second baby who was on oxygen so we had a  month old and a  month old. It was mad but we did it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16211, distribution: 1.0 ; Very behind on tumblr due to the babies! We're just doing some support care for a few days. Yesterday was difficult but today I have figured out what I'm doing and it has gone like a dream. Quite proud of how well we've managed to be honest, given that they arrived with only  hours notice and minimal information. It's going to make me appreciate my baby-free life when I get it back again though! And taking care of one baby will feel easy peasy in comparison. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14854, distribution: 0.24032187162787702 ; Question: Do you have plans for what to do when your kids are all out of the nest? Are you going to work, foster more, just enjoy life? Just curious! :) Answer: Probably continue to foster and other commitments within the fostering community.But also travel and enjoy life. H and I had our children when we were relatively young and right at the start of our marriage. We hope we can get some more of that us-time when the children are all grown. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15888, distribution: 1.0 ; So it turns out that even though H is off work for the four day weekend we can't share the baby care because the baby likes no one but me

Doc ID: 14313, distribution: 0.46949306166219945 ; I know I've been a bit quiet on here since the babies arrived. My life is just quite mad with very limited moments for myself. d is home from university too so there's  of us in our  bedroomed house. We are all going away for a few nights in a weeks time, it's a good job we have a seven seater car so everyone will fit in, but not sure where the luggage is going to go 😳 Yesterday we had a lovely Easter Sunday and then because Easter Monday is a bank holiday for us too, we have had a chilled out day today. I did squeeze a run in over midday naptime. Then I squeezed two  minute power naps in through the afternoon (plus I've been wearing my pyjamas since pm!!). A friend cooked a lovely meal and dropped it round for us this evening. I feel so blessed not having to do any cooking or plan any meals for now.  I have therapy tomorrow although the days feel all out of whack because it's been a four day weekend. I did exchange texts with her on Easter Sunday and she sent me a picture of a Simnel cake she'd made. I sent her a picture of us all out for a sunny Easter walk in return.  I think that's about all I have to update right now. Hope everyone's doing ok and has had a lovely Easter!

Doc ID: 17063, distribution: 0.23038540067050037 ; Therapy this week has made me feel super-needy ugh  I had a second session of the week this morning and at the end T told me to do something nice for the rest of the day. I brought the baby for a swim and now she's fast asleep while I sit in the cafe with a coffee and my book. It's nice now but may not be nice when I try and get her to bed later! However I did wake her up super early this morning so that she was ready to go back to sleep by am so I could do therapy in peace. Feel a bit guilty but I don't think she minded too much. She got a nice three hour nap all morning till midday

Doc ID: 14824, distribution: 0.16349823973221086 ; Question: What is adoption transitions? Answer: When a child is moving from their foster home and family to the adoptive home and family. It's a structured process that's designed to gradually build an emotional bridge between the two families to help the child start to transfer their attachment from the foster family to the adoptive family. It also helps the adopting parents get to know the child and experience what their life is like with the foster family. So the adopters basically come for gradually increasing periods of time and at different times of day to experience all parts of the child's routine. Today they've been here from .am until .pm. Yesterday they were here from pm to pm. Tomorrow it's am-.pm. It usually lasts about two weeks, and the second week is based more at the adopters house with increasing amounts of time spent there.

Doc ID: 14407, distribution: 1.0 ; Ok so good news! The snuzpod fits, but my exit from the bed is now even tinier and more awkward than it was previously. If you can't tell from the photo, I'm also under the sloping roof so I can't stand upright when I get out of bed. Now we have to decide what to do with the Moses basket which has been living at the end of our bed - providing useful storage as you can see. We don't need two baby sleeping spaces. (I see you social services, we only take ONE baby!) If the Moses basket goes, the snuzpod could live at the end of the bed when we don't have a baby, although it's taller and longer so might be too much in the way. Conclusion: we need more storage space for baby equipment 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17140, distribution: 1.0 ; Ahhh baby  went home to her regular foster carers today. Sad times. I miss her. But also I am looking forward to being able to sit down for a moment here and there through the day. We have plans to meet up next week so I can have a little cuddle with her again. It's very quiet sitting in the lounge without the oxygen machine rumbling away in the corner. H wants us to switch it on just to keep ourselves company 😂. Isn't oxygen therapy a Thing? Maybe I should try it. I went out for a run this evening, but only remembered halfway through eating tea that my stomach is never happy running straight after a meal. So I went for my run anyway and my stomach wasn't happy, but I made it round. My running form is just going down down down but I'm kind of resigned to it for now. My time to run will come round again. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15513, distribution: 0.16444365305448266 ; Question: Hi! I remember you said you foster / used to foster babies. How do you let them go?? I'm currently fostering a cat and I am going to have such a hard time letting her go. Answer: We let them go because we have to. There's no way we could do it if we had a choice about it. Saying goodbye is absolutely the hardest part of fostering. It is one of the most emotionally painful things I have ever done, and I've done it  times now. Sometimes I cope reasonably well with the grief, and sometimes it absolutely flattens me for weeks and weeks. There's been times I've felt I can't put myself through this pain ever again, but so far I've always gone back. We always have a break after a baby has moved on, and we don't go back on the list for a new placement until we've got ourselves emotionally back on track. (I know this was an old ask and I hope you managed ok to say goodbye to your foster cat if that time has passed) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15521, distribution: 0.5832031365637644 ; I ventured out in the car on my own (with a child and the baby) this evening. H and the other two girls came too but we met them at the shop. It felt a big thing. I have only driven twice in the last three months since lockdown and I haven't been out anywhere on my own apart from runs and walks locally. I've quite enjoyed the small life that we've been pushed into by lockdown, and now I'm having to reacclimatise to venturing back out into the big world. Of course once I got out of the door, it felt ok. Trying to get my head round organising everything to leave the house was the hard bit, and if I'd have been going on my own, I'd have put it off and put it off. Anyway, it's done now and hopefully next time will be easier. (I did have a large glass of wine to celebrate when I got home) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15937, distribution: 1.0 ; Another day in lockdown draws to a close Today has been a restful day. Apart from some energetic PE with Joe at am, I have just pottered around the house. I have read some of my book, done some jigsaw, and completed lesson one (of sixty!) of a free online Level  British Sign Language course. I can now sign appropriate greetings for any time of day to anyone with a three letter name. Good morning Liz! Good afternoon Ash! I can also introduce two people with three letter names and explain if they are hearing or deaf.  The baby has been more settled than the last couple of days which has meant I have not had to spend the whole day jiggling and snuggling her. We went out for a little walk for our daily exercise allowance, but I got a bit freaked by all the closed shops and all the people around (it's hard to pass at a m distance on a narrow pavement with a pram) and hustled back to the safety of our quiet road and our house. This evening we've had a Zoom with our church small group which has been lovely. We prayed specially for the NHS and social services as there's several personal connections to those within the group. Hope everyone is doing ok and staying safe and healthy x 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16694, distribution: 1.0 ; My sister and her husband and my two little nephews are coming to stay this weekend. My nephews are  and  and adore their cousins, but they haven't ever been to our house before as usually we go up to their house (it being about  times the size of ours!) I have a rough plan for the weekend and for the meals so feeling like that's organised. My sister and family can have our bedroom, which has plenty of floor space for the nephews too. Then H and I will sleep in d's double bed. d will sleep in d's pull out bed, and d will just sleep in her own bed. The baby room is still free but there's no space for anyone to sleep in there unless they don't mind hopping in the cot.  Today my main task is tidying and cleaning. I have a mountain of ironing from the holiday washing, but I like ironing. I can catch up on the latest episode of The Apprentice while I'm doing it. Cleaning bathrooms I don't like so much but I must grit my teeth and just get on with it. I'll bribe myself with a reward for after I've done them. Looking forward to a glass of wine tonight too 🍾

Doc ID: 15347, distribution: 0.2262192654859566 ; Question: What would happen if there were multiple babies born to a mom that needed a foster family but they couldn't put them with one family? Answer: They would have to put them between multiple families and then organise for them to have contact together on a regular basis. I know someone in my town who fostered baby triplets. Although we are only approved for two babies, in a specific situation like that we could be flexible as I think they would try and keep the babies together if at all possible.

Doc ID: 16003, distribution: 1.0 ; Baby sleep anon… I have so many questions! I got your second message, thanks. So I'm wondering, how long does she nap at the second nap in total, whether it's two short sleeps or one long one? Also how does she fall asleep at bedtime  - do you put her down awake or does she nod off on her bedtime milk, do you sit with her till she's asleep etc? What about daytime naps, where and how does she get to sleep for those? Do you swaddle her, put her in a sleeping bag, just put a blanket over her etc? Does she have a dummy/pacifier? Does she sleep in your room? Are you with her in the daytime or is she in daycare? Do you offer her a bottle every time she wakes in the night, and if so approx how much milk does she drink each time? How much does she drink at her daytime feeds? And lastly, and this is really one of the most important things. You said you feel desperate. Is that because she used to follow a routine and now she doesn't, or is it because you're exhausted and just want a good nights sleep, or because some book or another says she should be sleeping better than she is, or is it some other reason I haven't mentioned?  It's not so easy to do this via anon message, so if you wanted to send it off-anon or via chat, I could give you a private answer. Else send me another anon message with the above info and then I'll write it all in the answer to the first one! Or if you don't want to go in that much detail, just let me know and I can just give you some general tips x Ps it's nearly midnight here so I'm off to sleep but I'll try and get back to you tomorrow

Doc ID: 16582, distribution: 0.27931867684469236 ; Ugh guys, it has not been a good day. I think I might be a bit PMT-ish as I have this overwhelming sense of low mood and nothing is right. Good things have happened today. I went for a lovely run this morning, while the frost was still on the ground and the sun was shining and was home by .am to get on with my day. I thought I would spend the whole day after that in comfy clothes on the sofa, watching Greys anatomy and organising a photo book. But as I came home from my run, I discovered H hadn't taken his car to work, so I offered to take d out driving in her free period. We went to the gym car park and spent an hour reversing in and out of spaces. She definitely improved, which was encouraging for her and rewarding for me. Then I got home from that and found the oven had terminally broken 😫 so a mad scramble to buy a new one while all the black Friday deals are still on. H wouldn't answer his phone, which made me really grumpy and unable to move on to the next thing till I'd got through to him. I won't go on because it's b o r i n g but the day carried on being meh, even through our annual tradition of Christmas bauble buying 😭. The girls still insist we carry out this tradition but then actually have minimal interest in choosing a bauble and basically grab the nearest one so they can go and look at iPhones in the tech department. I think it's time to change the tradition up a bit. Although I can't tell how much of my negative feeling is due to my overall negative mood. If anyone wants to cheer me up, please go for it. Send some smiles this way 🙃 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15514, distribution: 0.22781896497772786 ; Question: Have you ever thought about adopting one of the babies you fostered?  Answer: It has never really got to the point of us having to seriously consider that decision. Adoption is not the natural end point of fostering. Assessment to be foster carers and assessment to be adopters are generally two separate routes in the UK, so just because you've done one, doesn't mean you can automatically do the other without any further assessment. IF we fostered a baby and IF that baby became subject to a placement order (the court decided reconciliation with birth parents or relatives not an option) and IF there were no adopters nationwide ready within a few months who could be matched with our baby…. then we would consider adoption. However if we were to adopt, that would take up our spare room and we would have to stop fostering. And our heart is really for fostering, for standing in that gap for a child. So that's something we would bear in mind too. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15081, distribution: 1.0 ; Today has been a Good Day. Such a relief after a couple of weeks of feeling mostly blah. I think it's because my cold seems to have gone and I've been busy today. My Get Up and Go seems to have come back! I had another foster carer come round for coffee first thing. She's a very new foster carer and I'm mentoring her, so we had a chat about all things fostering and that was lovely. It's great to share things you feel passionate about. Then baby and I hustled out to our baby sensory class, which the baby loves. When we got home, she went down for a nap and I went out for a run. H working from home has some benefits! I ran k along my favourite route and it felt so good to feel up to running again. Two weeks of feeling rubbish with a cold and a cough has meant I haven't done any running for a while. Came home and baby had woken up from her nap, so I've been entertaining her and trying to send a few emails this afternoon, as well as chatting with d - it is lovely to have her around again. It's been great to feel I have enough energy to bustle around doing these things and just feel better in myself. On the downside I haven't really eaten any meals so far today, due to the hustling around. That's not good. I've made a macaroni cheese and broccoli bake for tea so I will definitely eat some of that. Eating hasn't been so good over the last two weeks due to my loss of appetite through being ill and also the low mood I've had. I need to get myself back on track before it spirals into anything worse. Maybe I'll mention it to my therapist tomorrow, although I don't want to get into a big discussion about it (too much else to talk about). I'll just tell her it's not been great but I'm going to make an effort to make it better this week. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15917, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Although I understand it completely it's so heartbreaking to read that the baby only gets  minute visits with the parents each day. That must be difficult for you as well. Sending you and your family love Answer: Yes I imagine the hardest thing for them is just not being able to hold her. Newborn babies don't do a whole lot in terms of interacting, so she used to just sleep all the way through her face to face contact anyway. But she could have cuddles with parents and smell them and hear them. Now I have to try and predict a  minute window each day when she'll be awake, so they can see her and she can hear their voices.  minutes is quite long enough for baby, she usually ends up grizzling during it anyway. By the time she's fed and burped and had a nappy change, she's not too impressed with having to stay awake for a while longer. A small benefit though is that they get to see her five days a week whereas it used to be only three when it was face to face. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15630, distribution: 0.3292763310059829 ; Question: I think I was less than two at the time and my sibling was less than a month old. I am not a parent but hope to baby wear if I have kids in the future. Did you baby wear your own kids? Answer: I didn't really because it was before it really became a “thing”, so I had a baby bjorn baby carrier which I used for going out and about when it was easier than the pram, but they're not so popular either now (they don't hold the baby's legs in the best position apparently).

Doc ID: 17206, distribution: 1.0 ; Ahhh babies 👶👶 💕💕  We had a mad morning.  Baby  had a hospital appt at . so baby  had to go to a friend. In order to get both babies up, fed, changed, dressed, fed again, bags packed up and baby  dropped off with friend in time for me to get to the hospital with baby , I had to start the day at .am.  Thankfully we made it all on schedule. Two babies is physically exhausting compared to one (obvious I suppose but it's easy to discount the double exertion involved.) It's like running a km but using all the energy of a km. Two babies and an oxygen cylinder (it is NOT “lighter than air” - it is actually very heavy!) in and out of car seats, in and out of the house, in and out of the car…. We all made it home for .am, just in time for me to eat breakfast (👍) then take d to her friend's house to head off to Greece for two weeks, lucky girl! Got home from THAT about midday ahhhhh It's been a quieter afternoon inside but thunderbolts and lightening outside. Thumping rain. It's .pm now and I'm counting down the hours to baby bedtime. Although last night, baby bedtime was an extended period that went on till .pm ugh 😴 so hoping for nearer pm tonight. I am escaping for a swim and a relax in the spa at .pm, whether they're asleep or not. H can take over at that point! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15858, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: maybe a good strategy for getting the girls to realize you do work hard all day would be to a “life swap.” for the course of one day,  you do all the activities they might do, and they do the same for you. this includes taking care of the baby, cleaning, cooking, etc. since you're all home this might be the perfect time to do it, and might result in them seeing the amount of work you do.  Answer: Haha it's a great idea in theory but I think in reality trying to get them to do everything the way I like it would be more stressful than just doing it myself!!Sometimes we have struggles but when I'm calm and not exhausted, I know they are actually pretty good most of the time. D does a lot of the cooking and d has been learning to do the laundry in preparation for going off to uni. d is also helpful with the baby. d is pretty un-useful but I pick my battles. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15319, distribution: 0.22250025143259672 ; Question: How long are the babies allowed to stay with you? Can you only have babies stay with you? Answer: We only take babies because our only spare room has a cot in it and it's not big enough for a single bed. The babies stay with us until the court process has been completed and they either return to their birth parents or they move to an adoptive family. That's usually between  months and a year. About  years ago, the UK government set a  week target from the initial care order to the final court order, and although extensions often have to be applied for, that has speeded the whole process up. The first couple of babies we fostered we had for nearer  years each, and that is a long time for a baby to be in temporary foster care rather than with their forever family, bonding and attaching. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15854, distribution: 1.0 ; An unexpected consequence of these lockdown times is that that baby gets loads more holding and cuddling. No one is going anywhere, so with the baby there's no groups to go to, no car rides, no teenager activities to try and fit around, no evening activities to go out to that I need to try and get the baby asleep before I go. So the baby leads a lovely life that is just a constant round of feeding, snuggling and sleeping. When she wakes early from a nap, she gets more snuggling till she goes back to sleep again. It's nice. Maybe this is what it used to be like for babies back in simpler times. When busy lives didn't have so many demands on our time.  The first couple of weeks after lockdown occurred, I said to friends “this is a rubbish time to be a baby!” - mainly because I couldn't buy nappies, I couldn't buy formula milk, and no health or social care professionals wanted to come and visit us. But now I think “this is the best time to be a baby!” - just nesting and nurturing. Who'd have thought it.

Doc ID: 15575, distribution: 0.37418713003733434 ; Therapy ..  feels horrible to be peacefully going about my day and then to keep being hit by a random jolt of panic out of nowhere” I used the example of the first few weeks of having a new foster baby, and how when we're out in the car, I always get these waves of 'omg I've left the baby behind'. A physical jolt of dread. I have to glance into the back seat to reassure myself that the baby is there.  “But that's ok to check the baby is there, it only takes a couple of seconds to glance back, but I can't keep trying all my clothes on every time I have a leg panic…. and besides, not forgetting the baby is important but I want to not care about the size of my legs! I am so much more than the size of my legs!” “OK” said T, “let's go with that. You know I like my positive statements. What positive things about yourself can you say instead?” She pointed out that it's good to have statements about being, not doing. Because eventually in life we won't be able to 'do' but we will always 'be'.  I talked about how I can appreciate my legs for what they can do, for being strong and able to walk and run and carry the baby around. T asked me what “I am” statement I could make about that. It was hard. My brain panics and goes blank, a hangover from being a child and being put on the spot and knowing there was always a “right answer” but not knowing what it was. She had to help me out but we got three statements. • I am someone who values trying to stay healthy and keep fit • I am someone who cares for others • I am someone who understands and values the need for babies to develop good attachments  T said the way to retrain my brain was that every time I felt that panic about my legs, I had to think those statements. I agreed to give it a try. I said it felt better than trying to reassure myself that my legs were still the same size, because doing that just reinforced to me that the size of my legs was important. And honestly, I would really rather not care about the size of my legs. I feel so shallow when in the midst of everything going on in the world, I am here crying over the fact that my thighs might be mm bigger than they used to be. That is not in line with my values at all. It's time to get my brain to catch up.

Doc ID: 14758, distribution: 0.200355860055295 ; Question: I've always wondered about you referring to foster caring as a job. Where I live, people who have foster children also work outside the home at full time jobs. I know you care specifically for very young babies so is it because of that or is foster care just different where you live? Answer: In the UK, if you foster care for a baby you can't really work. If you worked then you'd have to put the baby in daycare and that sort of goes against what you're trying to achieve in terms of building a secure attachment. But also babies have lots of contact with birth families during the week and you need to be around to facilitate that, and also meetings, reviews, and appointments. So it's not really practical to have another job at the same time.It is possible to work in a job outside the home if you foster older children who are in school, but probably not working full time and you would need a flexible job so that you can be available during the day if needed for meetings etc. It's also about having enough mental physical and emotional energy for the therapeutic parenting that children in care often need. It might be hard to have the energy to give these children what they need if you're working, it's hard enough working and having your own birth children, never mind children who need even more from you (as they rightly should).

Doc ID: 15017, distribution: 0.21831710784543712 ; Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that's not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say  years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it's up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that's the foster care that we do. Then there's permanence foster care. This is when the child won't be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they're + and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there's adoption, where usually there isn't any contact with the birth family. There isn't much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic  weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the (+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it's done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were  years ago. However it's one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day . To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past.

Doc ID: 14561, distribution: 0.2329923059850296 ; Question: Are you willing to share how and when you became involved in fostering and if your husband also wanted to foster? Answer: We had our three children, the youngest was , and I started thinking about a fourth baby. H wasn't sure about four children and it took me a few months to talk him round. After he finally agreed, I started worrying that four children might tip us over the edge and it would have been me that pushed us into it. Around the same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster, and thought that was something we could do. So we looked into it and it seemed so right. I could still get my baby fix and H could stop panicking about the costs of raising four children. We went to an initial introduction to fostering meeting, and that started the whole process off. A year later we were welcoming our first foster baby. We absolutely love fostering and have never regretted our choice ❤️

What is the best and worst thing about fostering babies? And did you choose to foster babies only? Answer: Thankyou ❤️The best thing is that I love babies and I get to use that in a job where I can be at home for my family and also make a real difference to someone's future. I'm good at caring for babies and it comes very naturally to me. So all in all it's a very satisfying situation all round.The worst thing is having to say goodbye to them when they move on. I think I should say that's the hardest thing, rather than the worst thing, because ultimately it's the best thing for the baby - moving on to their new and permanent future, whether that's reunification with their birth parents or moving into adoption with their forever family. But there's no way round it being hard, both for the baby and for us.Yes we chose to foster only babies, because our spare room has only a cot in it. So we can only take a child who would be ok sleeping in a cot, or obviously the Moses basket in our bedroom. We don't exclusively foster newborns but that is usually who gets placed with us. We've had two babies in the past who were both a few months old when they came to us.

Answer: We foster as a family so it's always been very important to us that our kids are on board with it. They love the babies we foster and they're quite hands on in caring for them. There have been some really hard times for them because we foster, but also some really wonderful times. I think they have grown a lot through their fostering experiences and they see it overall as a positive thing.

Beautiful madness. We visited my in-laws and saw our niece for the first time since she was walking. I went all the way to the Shetland Islands for a weekend to run the most northerly park run in the UK. More madness. While we were up there I saw puffins for the first time. Amazing. The baby and I went on a mini-retreat to the seaside and I had a bit of a breakthrough thinking about therapy things. I went away with H for two nights and we stayed in a cow-themed room. The baby and I had a lovely day out to a country house and saw penguins. My sister had a festival in her garden for my BIL's big birthday and we all went up for the weekend. My mum and I did one of the most scenic parkruns in the UK along the shore of the lake. My teenagers had birthdays, grew up, didn't want to have days out, didn't tell me when they would be home, stayed up all night on their gadgets, slept in till midday, and did all the other things teenagers are supposed to do in the summer holidays which drive their parents mad. I ❤️ them. The baby and I had a daytrip to meet up with @raspberryrose and her baby, which was fab. A sudden heavy rain shower put a rapid end to our picnic but then it passed and we spend the afternoon pram pushing in glorious sunshine. I tag @raspberryrose , @eattodefeat and @productivetimewasting if you want to join in.

Totally winning at this holiday life. Toddler saw free range chickens and nearly went out of her mind with excitement. I'm pretty certain this is the furthest she has ever been away from her place of birth. We tried to explain the concept of holiday to her but obviously she is only one year old so probably had no idea what we were talking about. Hopefully because we are all here with her and lots of her familiar items are here too, this won't feel like a traumatic move but a fun one. Hard to know what sense she makes of it. Our only stress on arrival was there wasn't a travel cot in the cottage and it said there would be. I messaged the homeowner to ask about it and she did bring one round but she said to us “oh I just have a booking for  adults here”. I literally had tried to add the two babies onto the Airbnb booking as soon as we knew they would be with us, and when I hit submit it said I didn't need to do that because the price wouldn't change, just to message the host and let them know. So I did that two weeks ago and told her that we would need to use the travel cot please. She was really nice about bringing it round but I felt mildly irritated that she implied it was our fault when I had actually told her and she just hadn't paid proper attention to her messages. Anyway, no complaints now. The travel cot is set up at the end of our bed and the pop up Moses basket is set up next to my side of the bed and let's hope the babies sleep well. Goodnight all!

Answer: Well, we had had our three girls, they were ,  and , and I really wanted us to have another baby. H wasn't so sure and I spent a few months trying to persuade him. Eventually he came round to the idea, but then I had a panic and thought what if we have baby number  and it tips us over the edge, and it's me that's pushed us into that.So then at that same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster. I had taken some time out from my job as a doctor so that I could be at home with the girls, and when we started talking about fostering, I suddenly thought, we could do that! I could look after a baby and get that need met in me plus having a job while still being able to be at home with our children, and H could stop panicking about the cost of raising four children. We started looking into fostering, and doing all the assessments and before we knew it we were approved foster carers. It felt it was exactly the right thing for us to do then, and it still is now 🥰

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now.

Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.23480166455199128 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

Answer: Yes and yes!H has been working from home at a desk in our bedroom for two weeks now, and thankfully the weather has been nice so d and d have been outside sitting in the garden a lot of the day, while d holes up in the bedroom she shares with d. It's a lot easier being on lockdown with three teenagers than three small children though so I'm very grateful for that. I'm quite enjoying the family time, the only thing that drives me mad is I can spend almost all day trying to catch up with myself on housework because as fast as I clean and tidy, someone messes things up again. Depending on how bad the previous night with the baby has been affects how much patience I have for things.Our family motto during this lockdown time has been “extend your grace” which for us just means, give a little extra, take an extra moment before you shout back, have a little extra patience, be a little extra generous, react a little less. It's getting us through.

I'm holding on to the fact she is nearly six weeks and I hope she's read all the books that say it should get better after that. I know it will get better eventually. I've looked after lots of babies that were unhappy at this age, but there seemed always something to explain it - drug withdrawal, medical issues, prenatal trauma. Of course all babies in foster care have trauma from separation from their birth parents, so maybe some of it is just that coming out. Or maybe she's just an unsettled baby. It's easier to cope with when there's a reason that you know about.

Will you get to visit her ever after she leaves? Do you like the adopters? My daughter is around the same age and I have felt so sad and nervous for you guys all week.  Answer: Aw thankyou, thoughtful anon. So many questions…. let me answer them one by one.Baby is doing great with the transition so far. As we have progressed, she has had some periods of being unsettled when the adopters and me are all around, as she can sense something is changing and she is confused by who she wants and the different pulls on her emotions.When she came to stay with us, it was as a foster placement, so we always knew she would be moving on sooner or later. The government target is  weeks from court order for placement to final decision, so we had a rough idea she'd be with us  months or so, but you just never know. Things can change, she could have moved much earlier to a foster-to-adopt placement.Yes we have some scheduled visits after she leaves. Recent research has shown that contrary to what standard practice used to be, foster carers visiting the child soon after placement helps the child settle in their new placement. It reassures them that their attachment figures haven't abandoned them, while they are still building their new attachment with their adopters. Also the adopters comforting them through the grief the baby naturally feels and expresses after seeing their precious foster carers helps build the baby's attachment bond with the adopters.The adopters are lovely. We really like them. They are quite young and so full of energy, warmth and enthusiasm. We have got on with them really well and hope that after baby moves to them, and after we have done all our scheduled visits, they will still keep in touch with us.Thankyou for thinking of us, it is really a difficult and draining time with a lot of mixed emotions xx

Doc ID: 16034, distribution: 0.23871229496961413 ; Question: why does baby get contact with mom if shes in foster care? is it only for babies or for older foster kids too?  Answer: All children have the right to a family life through the Human Rights Act. This means even if they are brought into foster care, they have the legal right to continue to have a relationship with their birth family unless or until there is good reason to stop this. This applies to all children of all ages. When children have arranged contact with their birth family, this right to family life is protected (even though arranged contact may not be what everyone views as 'family life').Baby will continue to have supervised contact with her birth mum until a ruling is made by the court abut her future. Imagine if there was no contact, and then the court found six months later (the standard minimum length of family court proceedings in the UK) that mum was able to safely parent her baby. By then mum and baby wouldn't have seen each other for  months and the relationship would have been severely damaged. Contact can also form a very useful part of the parenting assessment, which contributes to the court's final decision.Newborn babies typically have relatively large amounts of contact with their birth parents -  hours, three or four times a week. This helps preserve their relationship in the critical early months of life until a court ruling has been made. Older children in care of the local authority have varying amounts of contact depending on the circumstances, but very rarely as frequent as newborns.

The girls, we usually tell them the outline and the reasons the baby is in care, and the thoughts on the future court process and likely outcome, but I don't tell them every last detail. Partly because I don't want to put that burden of having to keep all that information confidential on them. Their friends naturally ask them questions, and it's hard to negotiate those conversations and remember what you can and can't say, so it's easier for them to just not know too many details.

I don't have any numbers to back that up, but their welfare system is well-developed, people generally live in good and spacious conditions, etc. I believe I read the people who have died in Sweden are elderly and/or refugees(who don't have access to all their resources...). You're right, it is interesting. Answer: I agree Sweden is a healthy place to live, I also have UK friends living there. However if you look at the deaths per million, Sweden have the th highest in the world so they're maybe not doing that great. But even the deaths number is so variable between countries, including or excluding as it does different settings. And being variably representative of the truth in different countries.

Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.

Answer: All hell is potentially about to let loose as the pubs re-open in two days timeOur infection and death rates are lower than they've been since the start of the pandemic, but they have stalled a bit. We are allowed to meet with one other household in our garden or inside our house from this weekend, and social distancing is reducing from  metres to “ metre plus” (??). I've lost track of exactly what else is happening and exactly when. Schools are still closed except to children of keyworkers and two primary school year groups. Most people are still working from home where it's possible.

Doc ID: 16008, distribution: 1.0 ; I read a lot of posts about people worrying over catching coronavirus and how to prevent it. Guys, most of us are going to catch it no matter what we do. At least % at a conservative estimate. The social distancing, self isolating etc is not to stop us catching it but just to delay it, slow the rate of new cases and flatten 'the peak' so that our various health services can cope with the numbers of seriously ill cases needing hospital care at any one point in time. For most of us who are under  and healthy, we are going to catch it, recover and then likely be immune and be able to get out there and be useful as we will no longer transmit it.  Keep washing your hands and following the advice given, but understand that none of it will guarantee to prevent you catching coronavirus sooner or later. Plus if you don't catch it this year, you'll probably get it next winter when its likely to come back.

We do have measures for restaurants though; you have to reserve ahead of time to come in, then leave your number and name once you arrive so you can be contacted in case there's an outbreak at the the time you were there. It's also meant to ensure that you can trace back where an outbreak came from, and immediately contact people ahead of time to self quarantine. Answer: Germany continued- we never had a full lockdown either. We immediately enforced social distancing, non essential stores closed, and meeting people was limited to two people outside, and only households were allowed to be in the house together. Now we can have meetings of groups, more than two households can meet at someone's house, non essential stores have opened, and are numbers are due to sporadic outbreaks in specific areas (restaurants, easter vacations, etc…)——————-That sounds very well organised and under control. Very German! Sehr gut! Germany has appeared to manage the pandemic very well from what I've read and seen.

Answer: I think most people in the UK are ok with wearing them. There certainly has not been much controversy. I think (choosing my words carefully) there has been a much broader range of opinion on masks in the US, some of which seems incomprehensible to us in the UK. In our family, we have been wearing them when out and about in enclosed spaces. Even though their main aim is to protect others, they also give a sense of protection to ourselves and I think that increases people's decision to wear them.

Big shoutout to @veganmutti for her crazy shopping trolley organisation, and @notjustclothing for sending me one of their face masks ✌🏻
-
Ok so in all honesty, something that was once a very normal activity felt incredibly strange. Mum and I was also very surprised that very few people were wearing masks!? In the UK it hasn't been mandatory to wear them in shops. Wearing a mask on public transport by is essential. However ... literally the next day it was announced that from the th of July, face coverings will be compulsory. Personally, I feel safer wearing a mask to protect those around me, and myself. Not sure if you feel the same? 🤔
-
Also as I said, this mask was from @notjustclothing and they a running a campaign where % of the profits go to @masksfornhsheros! It is very comfortable, not itchy at all, reusable and comes in  colours (if looking good in a face mask is a priority for you 😉). More importantly though, they are made from Diolen, which is very hygienic and allows you to breathe (and talk!) normally. They're also made here in the UK, so I highly highly recommend if you need/want a mask.

Ultimately it doesn't make any difference and I'm so grateful to have unexpectedly been given the vaccine, I'd just like to be able to process the emotion of it with other people.

Answer: The point of isolation is to a) protect the vulnerable and b) *slow down* the rate of the general population catching it, so that our health services it is a process that doesn't really have a clear end date for exactly the reason you said. It's why the UK government have held out for a while, because if you quarantine everyone so efficiently that no one catches it, you just have a very vulnerable population when you let them out of quarantine.

Doc ID: 16351, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: When do you need to get your first cervical screening? Does it hurt? Answer: In the UK, it's at age . You should get a letter from your doctor inviting you to go. If you have never been sexually active, you are unlikely to need screening so check that out with your doctor before you go. This is because cervical cancer and the pre-cancerous changes that screening aims to pick up are connected with the Human Papilloma Virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. In the UK, teenage girls are routinely vaccinated against this now but you should still attend screening when you're invited. Teenage boys can pay to get the HPV vaccine privately currently, but I think they too may soon get it routinely on the NHS.No it doesn't hurt. It can just be a bit uncomfortable, but it's over really quickly. The more you can relax, the more comfortable it is - but of course that's easier said than done. I was able to chat to the nurse all the while she was doing it. I even commented that maybe I should have shaved my legs, and she made a pshaw kind of noise, like leg-shaving was so irrelevant in the world of cervical screening that she couldn't care less what state they were in. My appointment was at .am and I was walking out of the doctors surgery by .am so that's how quick it was.

Doc ID: 14464, distribution: 0.150059026193871 ; Question: I live in a suburban area in the States. We eat takeout   or  times a week. We can walk our neighborhood, however anywhere else on foot or bike is dangerous due to speeding and distance. People where I live still fly Trump flags, which I find disturbing. My parents are Trump supporters and my neighbor was at the Capitol riot. I deplore Trump and can't understand why people support him. Answer: My personal experience on the walking is largely driven by a stay in a suburban area outside New York, where the children's playground was  minutes walk away from the house but there were no pavements and when we walked anyway we got a lot of funny looks (and it didn't feel very safe). Then when we got there and said we'd walked, everyone else looked at us like we said we'd flown.I think takeout in the US is maybe different to takeout in the UK. Only based on the different ways we use it. In our family and the families around us, we might have takeout a couple of times a month as a treat. Our takeout is usually either curry, Chinese, pizza or fish & chips. They're pretty calorie dense and nutritionally poor in terms of vegetables etc and eating that  times a week would not be healthy plus it would be very expensive. I get the impression in the US that it's a) cheaper and b) a more regular way of feeding oneself?

How can afford all those trips? For some reason I always thought you were pretty well off... hope this doesn't seem judgy, that's not my intent at all!!  Take care!  Answer: I personally don't know any family who could suddenly pay out an extra £ a month and not bat an eyelid about it. It takes some adjustment to get used to, some switching round of the budget, adjusting expectations and spending decisions. If anons think that the majority of families out there wouldn't be affected by that, I think they're sadly mistaken and maybe not having realistic expectations of what adult, meals out etc are all factored into the family budget. A sudden additional regular outgoing is not factored in and so rearrangements have to be made, but they can't happen on the spot. I can't cancel a holiday that's already paid for, and I can't get a refund on a meal we had last month. We afford vacations because we are careful with our money and we budget and we are privileged to have enough income that with doing these two things, we can do a lot of the things we would like to do, and we are grateful for that.

Answer: Yes I definitely follow the news in the US and have been seeing the riots. We have had protests in the UK today, but they don't tend to escalate into rioting and looting. I think in the UK the public's relationship with the police is different to the US. In fact so much is different due to our countries' different histories and our different constitutions and day to day life experiences, that it is hard for us to fully understand each other's positions. Some issues are relatable across the culture divide though.

I had the vaccine  weeks ago and my behaviour hasn't changed one bit as a result. I still wear a mask, still social distance and definitely have not been hugging anyone outside my household. It never occurred to me that after having the vaccine I could do any other things… I don't know if that's just me being dumb.  Probably it's partly me because I know I'm quite black and white about things, and I just follow the rules, vaccine or no vaccine. So as and when UK lockdown relaxes, I'll go with that. Maybe it's partly that I'm lucky that I'm quite happy with my lockdown life and so I'm not looking for any ways out. d wants to come home from uni next weekend for d's birthday, and I really don't agree but it seems she's coming anyway.

We stayed in a lovely Airbnb apartment on the middle two floors of a classic tall Georgian house that had private parking and was within walking distance of the city centre (two of our main criteria!). We were supposed to be having  days holiday in Spain this month, but that obviously isn't going to happen so a mini-break to Bath and later this month a week in Cornwall are our replacement holidays. For my non-UK followers, the UK government has an Eat Out to Help Out scheme running in August, where they will pay half the price of food and soft drinks at participating restaurants. It makes eating out much cheaper, especially when you're a family of five - we can save £ per meal.  Anyway, Bath was lovely. We walked all around the city, sat in the park outside the Royal Crescent and dreamt about living there, walked by the river, the girls did some clothes shopping, we went up to a park on a hillside outside the city and looked down at the views, d and I went for a couple of runs along the canal towpath… it was just an easy chilled out few days.

Baby's mum phoned in sick to the contact centre, but no one thought to ask her what her symptoms were. Contact centres could be hotbeds for viral spread, given the number of people going in and out of a small number of rooms all day every day. Plus there is VERY minimal (ie none) cleaning and sterilisation of toys etc going on between each contact session. I have fired off some emails enquiring about protocols. Schools are all still open but d's school has sent a letter saying that if they have to partially close due to teachers self-isolating or being off sick, certain year groups will be prioritised to continue going into school while other year groups will be told to stay at home.

Numbers of positive cases are on the rise again. The government has tried to spin it as being due to the increased numbers of tests that are being done in Covid hotspots, but that excuse is wearing a bit thin and unconvincing now. Schools have just gone back and several have had to send entire year groups home to self isolate or even close again after pupils and teachers tested positive. Universities are about to start over the next few weeks, which will cause another lot of mixing of people and quite likely cause a spike in cases. So, we sit and wait to see how bad it will be. Everything is pretty much reopened now, but things may have to start closing again in order for us to be able to keep schools open and case numbers down. For now we can meet  people or two households outside or just two households inside, but summer is coming to an end and autumn starts to get a bit chilly for meeting outside unless you are being active and walking etc Local lockdowns are in place in various areas where no meeting up indoors is allowed. I think we are headed for more of those. Just watching how even in New Zealand where they managed to have no cases at all for so long but then had a resurgence, I think it shows just how hard to control this virus is.

Answer: I find it very interesting but I just have more questions and no answers. I'm really curious for example as to why Germany has such a low mortality rate compared to the UK when I believe our healthcare systems are pretty similar. Is it an actual physical reality or is it to do with different representations of the numbers/ proportions of testing etc. I'm interested to watch Sweden and see their numbers given that they held firm against a lockdown at the point where the UK changed strategy. (Although I think we'd have had an even bigger disaster in the UK if we hadn't imposed a lockdown - and why hasn't that happened in Sweden?)Are there different mutations of the virus that have reached different countries, causing some to have higher mortality rates than others?How do genetics and population demographics impact on the death rate? Given that it's quite clear that having a higher BMI is a big independent risk factor for a poor outcome, how does that impact on the HAES movement? Why does smoking seem to be a protective factor and is this why some countries with higher proportions of smokers have lower mortality rates? What is really going on in many countries around the world whose data is suspect? And so on and so on.

 it's scary how something that happened so long ago still affects me right now. most of the time i don't even think about it, but it also seems to be all over me, does that make sense? my severe jumpiness is known to everyone, i've legitimately fallen to the ground and half under a table at work once - because one of my coworkers suddenly entered the room quite fast and it startled me. me falling or jumping away or flinching is a super regular occurence at this point. only a few trusted people are allowed to touch me, otherwise i get uncomfortable as hell, leading up to feeling paralyzed and in shock with a following panic attack in the worst case. sudden noises or people (especially men) shouting/following me/running towards me scare the shit out of me. i can't stand anyone being behind me really and i can't sit with my back towards doors/open space without going mad, i always look out for escape routes instinctively. it's a part of me at this point, yes my poor girlfriend … despite being careful and understanding and all, sometimes a single move can send me straight into a flashback, meaning i curl up into a ball and completely lose touch with reality while sometimes shaking or crying, reliving it in my head or just disassociating. in this state i absolutely cannot be touched, else i just move away from whoever touches me in blind panic and it gets worse. last time a blanket was put around my shoulders, i apparently got off from the bed head first and curled up at the wall, looking like a bunny in panic. it's not technically my fault and i am aware of that, but i feel so very bad about it still. i keep reassuring her that it is not her fault when i snap, and i'm working on communicating more clearly what i need/when i am not okay with something. she keeps telling me it's okay and i don't have to apologize, but i still feel so sorry. she's not the one who hurt me, it's not fair how she has to put up with it anyway now, kind of? because i know i'm not the only one who is struggling, i know it's hard for people to understand and rationalize it has nothing to do with them personally when i snap and panic. somebody who once accidentally triggered this response in me said “i'll never forget this look in your eyes, you were so scared … of me!”. it's weird. yes i was scared, but not really scared of you. just. scared?

And my friend. People I trust. I think it's more just don't broadcast it all over social media. I figure here doesn't count because it's anonymous. Actually I think maybe it's not quite such a big deal now because there's been quite a lot on the UK news today about how none of the vaccine must be thrown away and it should all go into the arms of people, so there'd be more understanding now of how we came to receive it. But probably not all the volunteers all over the country will get a chance to receive it, just because of different clinic circumstances, so I don't want anyone to think it's unfair.Do you mean different phases in the vaccine roll out? Yes there is, right now we are in phase one, which is over-s and frontline health care and social care workers. I think some of the clinically vulnerable as well? I'm not sure.

There's some thousands of people involved in it, in multiple countries. I've had a vaccine (and a second vaccine dose) which could be the COVID one or it could be a meningitis one (which they used as a control).

I'm sure the NHS logistics has it in hand but it is also a bit dependent on delays and timely deliveries of the various vaccines.

I fully appreciate not all Americans think the same, but to answer your questions of what we think of you as a country, we generally think the US is pretty crazy and we're glad we don't live there. We do watch in horror though because the US is such a big player on the world stage that its decisions make a big impact.

Doc ID: 15125, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Is the UK really wanting college students to not go home for the holidays? Answer: The government has said they won't rule it out. Which I know is not the same thing but it's worrying me, especially because I can see the logic in it, but surely for everyone's mental health they can't keep  year olds away from their families. But then I think what they did for care homes and hospital visitors etc and I fear they can.In Scotland students are not allowed to visit home, say for the weekend, because that classes as two households mixing indoors, which is not allowed. That rule hasn't come in in England yet but I'm worried it will do soon.I'm in the six month slump, weary of it all, and missing d and worrying about her - although she is settling in. I just want everything to be back to normal 😭

We are in the process of moving out of lockdown.We don't have to stay at home but we can't go into other peoples houses. We can meet up outside in groups of up to  as long as we all stay m apart from each other. Schools are mostly still closed and will be until September. Non essential shops are re-opening next week.What's it like for anyone else in other countries?

Doc ID: 15951, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you still believe quarantining the population is not effective because eventually everyone will catch it anyways? And earlier you said if no one catches it we are not building herd immunity? Is this true?  Answer: Hmm I think that's a bit of a twist on what I said. This is the situation as I understand it.Quarantining the population is effective because it *delays* the transmission, flattening the peak of the cases and decreasing the chance of the health services becoming overwhelmed. In the UK, we are all socially distancing and keeping  metres away from anyone not in our household. All non-essential businesses are closed. This will remain in place until the “surge” is over and the numbers of cases stabilise and fall to a manageable level for the health service. Then it's probable that some elements of the social distancing will be relaxed, and what is likely to happen then is that as we start to mingle again, the case numbers will gradually rise again. Then there'll be another clamp down and social distancing measures put back in place. This relax and tighten process will potentially be repeated several times over a period of months. Many of us will catch it during this time, but for lots of us we will have only very mild or no symptoms and may not even realise we've had it. If they bring in antigen testing, we will be able to test to know for sure who has had it.It's all theoretical at the moment because no one knows for sure how the virus behaves. We don't know yet if we will be immune to it once we've had it once, so it's hard to know whether we will as a population develop herd immunity but I think that's kind of the idea once most of us have had it.

Doc ID: 14768, distribution: 1.0 ; In the UK we have a five day window over Christmas where we are legally allowed to travel and visit with other households to make a three household bubble. The government is emphasising (as cases rise) that just because we are allowed doesn't mean we should.  We have decided in discussion with my parents and my sister, that we will travel up and visit them for the five days. I don't think they have worried over it half as much as I have. I wish they would express a bit more concern although they have had lower cases than we have so I think maybe it doesn't seem such an immediate worry. Anyway, we are going to isolate from Friday (tomorrow in fact) so we should have four clear days before we travel. Then we'll travel without stopping on the way. That's the best we can do. Once there we will just be in our bubble and won't go anywhere or see anyone else. H and I are practically self isolating anyway, we are very diligent at following the rules. The girls have been in school but today was their last day so all that contact stops from now. Of course that is all dependant on Boris not changing the rules over the next week which I would not be surprised if he did if cases keep on rising. Holding everything lightly. But we will all be gutted if we can't go.

Looking back through these photos honestly gives me life right now. I paused on this one whilst eating breakfast this morning because the background doesn't even look real 😮 It was taken in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, and aside from this photo, one of the first memories of this place that comes to mind is crocodiles ... and yep, we saw a fair few, it's cool🐊😏

Anyyyyyyway, back to reality. Self-isolation and social distancing measures are really starting to be taken seriously now in the UK. Of course it is % necessary in order to limit spread of the virus, BUT it only made me feel really sad yesterday. I don't even know why, but all the uncertainty in the world right now suddenly made me feel like this was never going to end ... and it hasn't even started!!!

Ok so I know this isn't very uplifting at all. But I'm sure the same thought has crossed each and every single one of our minds ... and there you have it.

Doc ID: 14528, distribution: 0.6628688609101809 ; Question: Are you able to share how the lockdown impacts lives on a daily basis? I feel like the news I see in the US don't really depict the lockdown. Answer: Hmm well for me it means I basically don't leave the house except for exercise, or once or twice a week to volunteer in the vaccine hub. It's work from home for H and school from home for the girls. Nobody else is allowed in the house or garden and we're not allowed to stay away overnight. I can meet up with one other person at a time outside in a public place to exercise, such as go for a walk together. We have to stay local for exercise, although there's no set rule on what is local, which means everyone interprets it differently (including the police who can and do impose fines if they consider you're not staying local). Non-essential shops are closed, but we can still shop online. We get our supermarket delivery once a week and so we generally don't have a need to go in any other shops anyway. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are closed although they are allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services so some have found ways to stay open. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14533, distribution: 1.0 ; I've been volunteering at the vaccine hub again this afternoon. It was crazy busy because we were doing two days worth of vaccines in one day. We got told last week a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was arriving on Tuesday and then later that a batch of Pfizer was arriving on Wednesday. The Pfizer has to be used in three days, so we had to do ALL the AstraZeneca today.  doses. We had to open a waiting room for the waiting room, because even with the best will in the world,  vaccinators cannot get ahead with those numbers. Every time one vaccinator table paused to draw up more vaccines, or to give a little extra time to someone who needed it, the queue built up.  I did a  hour shift and walked  steps. “Next please! Hi there…. come through…. follow me…. just take a seat right here” *big smile behind mask so that it spreads to my eyes and they can see it* Return to the door. Repeat. I think I might be doing it in my sleep. I'm back there again on Friday. I think today it was the + age group as well as healthcare workers. We are moving on to people not in the top four priority groups for the next few days, I think. Tomorrow I was meant be meeting a friend in the morning for a walk and another friend in the afternoon, but because our car is stuck on our road in the snow and likewise for my friend and her car, I've had to cancel the morning friend. I can't say I'm too sad. A rest will be nice.

Answer: No it was only for the month of August, and only Mon-Weds. It meant any restaurant that participated could claim back from the government half the cost of each person's meal up to £. Our family of five could order food and non-alcoholic drinks and instead of it costing us £ it would only be £. It was brilliant for us, we ate out all over the place loads more than we usually would. It was really popular, restaurants got booked out days and weeks in advance. There were downsides - some restaurants got overwhelmed and some people were rude, and now there's a feeling amongst some people that maybe it helped spread the virus. We as a family were sad when it ended though.

Doc ID: 14931, distribution: 0.1837251882758167 ; Question: just curious how other countries work.. Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the “highlights” (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news. We probably hear more about US news than we hear about many other countries, but I'm sure there's loads of US news that never makes its way onto the world headlines.On the BBC and ITV, which are our two main TV channels, there's always a news programme at pm. This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a / news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don't understand the American people a lot of the time. I know the election coverage has probably shown the worst of some groups but even outside that, in general we/they seem to have a different approach to life. Having said that, I'm sure the UK is horrifying to watch at times to others too.

Doc ID: 14428, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I'm surrounded by people inc. me who have completed the second Pfizer dosage and all have immunity now so we feel very free now (despite all the restrictions still in place). But the time between my first and second dosage I've never felt so on edge. The freedom comes with being fully vaccinated & being surrounded by vaccinated people. It will come. I mentally feel like I can breathe again. I can't wait till my grandparents have their second AZ and I can see them safely and hug them 🥰 Answer: Are you outside the UK? Even people who've had two doses here, we aren't allowed to be hugging each other or going inside someone else's house or even into their garden. We can't leave our local area (vaguely thought to be  miles from ones own house).Maybe when the lockdown ends and the country opens up again it will feel different. But that feels like it's lockdown related not vaccine related, although obviously the lockdown being lifted is related to the success of the vaccine roll out.

Doc ID: 15241, distribution: 0.10196678329319092 ; Hello tumblr This week I'm coming to you from Cornwall (for my non-UK followers, this is the very south west part of England). It was supposed to be Menorca, but eh… Covid disrupts the best laid plans. We left our home at am yesterday morning for the  hour drive. To Americans, I believe that's a standard day trip, but to us Brits that classes as “a very long car journey”. The traffic is notoriously bad on the route, causing long delays, hence the early start. Alarms went off at .am, we got up, packed the car and away we went. The girls promptly all fell back asleep, and H and I took turns to drive. At .am we stopped for brunch in a fab farmhouse-type restaurant (scrambled eggs on toast for me and full English for the other four), and by am we were in St Austell, dazedly walking round Tesco buying food for the next few days. d insisted on buying a giant watermelon. It's nice to be able to shop for holiday food without it being a huge eating disorder trauma, which it has been for me on so many family holidays. The only foods I “needed” us to buy were eggs and yoghurt, everything else I went with the flow of the communal decision making. I didn't even buy salad leaves, I looked at them and felt grateful that I don't even need to spin off down a spiral of feeling the obsession to have them. Shopping is so much easier without an eating disorder shouting in my head! After much hilarity trying to fit four full shopping bags into our already full car (you probably had to be there, but we just stood there by the car with the giant watermelon in our arms wondering where it could go - eventually we strapped it into the seating part of the baby's pram), we headed on to the Eden project (pictured above). We were really a bit too tired to enjoy it properly but it filled the afternoon until we could get into our holiday cottage nearby. Then we safely arrived at our cottage, unpacked, and the evening passed in a haze of snoozing on the sofas and then bedtime. Food today:  scrambled eggs on toast, porridge oats bar, half a tub of chilli bean soup, many slices of french baguette with spread (I was really hungry and ate and ate the bread),  chunky ginger biscuits,  pieces of chunky hazelnut dark chocolate. I think I underate today but my hunger cues were all confused from the early start and then being too tired later in the day to feel hungry or care.

Doc ID: 15934, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Obviously in the U.K. we are isolating at home but when looking at Sweden and South Korea, it's potentially not the solution to self-isolate? I'm not saying it's right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to “normal” - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn't change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I'm not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don't know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don't know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren't yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said “The only thing worse than no test is a bad test”. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren't reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let's see what today's press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8981, distribution: 0.7178746856778223 ; it's kind of crazy that as the very few in our social groups who actually took social distancing and wearing masks seriously, my boyfriend & i STILL tested positive for COVID a couple weeks ago

technically it was just his test that came out positive while mine read negative but given the % accuracy of a positive test and a % chance of a false negative AND we spent every day for the last  months together, i'm gonna say “we” both tested positive

we both came out asymptomatic, took necessary precautions to isolate, and are feeling fine now, but my point is… even the most careful people are exposed. we're lucky because we're young, healthy, and i guess aren't predisposed to being hit hard by the virus but many are not as fortunate

we got tested because it was free in our area, and i thought it would be useful to know if we were carrying even if we didn't have symptoms

the pandemic isn't over. in fact, california's numbers have not really improved since lockdown started and aren't being helped by the businesses and social areas are opening up

allllll i'm trying to say is to be careful, wear a mask, and if you must go see people, keep the circles small. sending you all love today!! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14936, distribution: 0.632673216741361 ; Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start….So first we had lockdown , where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was “Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives”Then that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was “Hands, Face, Space” ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had “Eat Out to Help Out”, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system - with varying rules on what we could and couldn't do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown .. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It's not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can't meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it's the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There's a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don't follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined £, for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan.

Doc ID: 16017, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I dont live in the UK so I dont know all the details, but from what I've seen it sounds like boris Johnson is not handling the coronavirus appropriately. Why aren't they shutting down and taking appropriate steps? It seems like he has made very insensitive comments about how some people will die and that he just doesnt care about the vulnerable population. I'm curious your thoughts Answer: Boris Johnson and his scientific advisors have made their recommendations on the basis of scientific predictions. I do understand the logic - we need around % of people to catch corona (and survive) so that we have herd immunity because this virus is likely to be a seasonal thing now. Also we need to flatten the peak of cases occurring now so that the healthcare system can cope. Plus people can only cope physically and emotionally with self isolating for finite lengths of time and may start disobeying it right at the critical time if we start too early. If we close the schools, grandparents may end up looking after the children thereby putting a vulnerable age group at more risk of catching it. Their model says schools would need to be closed for - weeks for it to be effective at preventing virus spread, which would clearly have a massive effect on the country.It's true though that people will die. I think Boris said that so we all appreciate the severity of the situation and the importance of doing our bit - handwashing, self isolating etc. Unfortunately it did come across as a bit uncaring and when we look at what the rest of the world is doing, it's hard to keep faith in the UK government that their policies are enough when many other governments clearly think differently.Partly also the UK is somewhat behind mainland Europe in the course of the pandemic. We still have relatively low numbers of covid . So their advice may change over the next few days and weeks as the situation changes.I'm following the BBC live news feed quite obsessively to keep up with the world situation.

Doc ID: 15806, distribution: 0.16821444857236406 ; STAY HOME  I'm so mad with people whose interpretation of the UK government's very simple motto “Stay home; Protect the NHS; Save lives” seems to include driving out for long walks in the countryside. Yes it may be quiet out there - but that's because the rest of us are following the spirit of the guidelines. If we all did what you're doing, it wouldn't be quiet! I know someone in the government said that it was ok to drive for exercise as long as the drive was shorter than the walk - but if you can exercise from your front door instead then DO SO. If you do not *need* to get in your car, then don't. Don't put yourself on the road, at risk of a car breakdown, a sprained ankle on that beautiful distant hill you're climbing up, or any other mishap that might require other people putting themselves at risk to come to your assistance. The exercise allowance is to help us stay physically and mentally healthy. It's not an excuse to go traipsing around the countryside to see some beautiful scenery. We are in lockdown because this is a global pandemic and many many people are dying. Let's get our priorities straight. No wonder the government won't tell us about the strategy to exit lockdown. We can't even cope with a very simple two word instruction “Stay Home”.

 I see… so many writing advice posts on Tumblr that can single handedly kill a young/beginning writer's style that it makes me want to scream sometimes.  
 Let yourself be messy in writing. If artists are allowed to get paint over everything, including themselves, you're allowed to have choppy sentences where the rhythm is weird and where you, god forbid, used an adverb. 
 Be the literary equivalent of an elementary school art class and be wild, innovative, and try new things out.

  I Will Not Be Eaten  
 Girl. Yes. 
 
 The voices of little girls are so powerful and profound because they haven't yet been completely eaten away at by social conditioning.  
 

 “I am a rich pie filled with knowledge. I will not be eaten.” Holy fuck my new motto.  
 
 Transcription (with original line breaks): 
 
  The true feminine  
  I am not sugar and spice and everything nice. I am music, I am art. I am a story. I am a church bell, gonging out wrongs and rights and normal nights. I was baby. I am child. I will be mother. I don't mind being considered beautiful, I do not allow that to be my definition. I am a rich pie strong with knowledge. I will not be eaten.   
 
 
 i'm not kidding, this poem shook me to my core. it inspired me more than any famous poet in the past few months. this little girl is going to influence the world in such a beautiful way. 
 

 little girls are gonna rule the goddamn world 
 


 This is why society works so hard to stifle girls and women.  


 This little girl has more talent in her little finger than every self-obsessed, “brooding” male poet who ever walked this earth. Epic.

Doc ID: 12171, distribution: 1.0 ; My midnight drawing muse: the creative and ethereal goddess, Florence Welch✨ In an interview with Vogue, she talked about sobriety & recovery, saying: “It is an act of rebellion to remain present, to go against society's desire for you to numb yourself, to look away. But we must not look away.” I think also of the line in 'Light of Love' that goes, “In some ways that was simpler, being too fucked up to see - I didn't have to wake up to the world that was around me.” Aside from loving her artistic style, I resonate with her honesty about recovery.

Doc ID: 12134, distribution: 1.0 ; I am so (so) very excited to share with you the song I've been working on! It's one of the first songs I've written that really sounds like my own voice. I could never listen to songs about hope when I was at rock bottom. They felt bright and glittery and cheap. So I wrote a song that I could actually relate to, and I hope you find some resonance in there too. I've never quite been convinced by rainbows and sunshine words, so here's to what some friends have lovingly termed, “tenacious goddamn hope,” the kind that meets you in the trenches. Here it is: My Kind of Hope, co-written and sung with Carrie Welling.

I picked it up and skimmed the pages of the story of a woman on a badass journey, and the first thing I read when flipping through pages was a quote by my favorite poet, Adrienne Rich.  I knew instantly that I was on board, as I had come to treatment holding Rich's poem, Diving into the Wreck: “the thing I came for: the wreck and not the story of the wreck the thing itself and not the myth.” I still bring Wild with me through each move (I maybe stole it from the treatment center, oops) & it became today's muse.

The sensitivity that led me to addiction is the same sensitivity that makes me a really good artist. The anxiety that makes it difficult to exist in my own skin also makes it difficult to exist in a world where so many people are in so much pain—and that makes me a relentless activist. The fire that burned me up for the first half of my life is the exact same fire I'm using now to light up the world.“ - Glennon Doyle, fellow recovery badass & my late night drawing muse

grave battle
that night when I prayed to the universe almighty
that the rise and fall of that chest would end
when I swallowed those pills
and closed my eyes to the world

and teach your heart to whisper its beats,
take up space
fearlessly
fiercely
ferociously
take / up / space
be unapologetic in your greed for life
you do not have to be light and thin and ethereal delicacy
disappearing into a ghost of a girl
I want you to be substance and weight and presence
and when you feel your voice pressing against your throat
desperate to get out the words that lay at the center of your soul
in a world that demands your silence
I want you to yell at the top of your lungs
letting loose the storm that swirls inside of you
you were not meant to deny the pull of lifelifelife pulsing through your veins
you were not meant to exist on a steady diet of “I'm sorry”
apologizing for the very air you breathe
you were meant to stand proudly
walking as though you command the room
speaking as though your words drip diamonds
because my god
we need you
we need your voice, your mind, your raging, passionate heart
and when this world asks you to be less
I want you to yell back as loudly as you can

Instead of viewing trips and slips on her recovery journey as negative setbacks, she views them as growth opportunities. She started referring to these as an A.F.G.O., Another F*cking Growth Opportunity. A.F.G.O. has now become our go-to saying in all Alliance support groups, and reminds us that although the journey to recovery may not be linear, it is possible…and it's happening (and it's never too late)!⁠⁠

_______________
First, i'd like to say that I know that the news can be overwhelming and traumatic for many (myself included). It's not something we like to scroll through on our spare time. Social media presents as a very useful tool for us especially now. We're here to spread awareness- not to fear monger - and to create and inspire change. If it makes us feel uncomfortable that's a good sign there's something we should probably attend to
_______________
I've made a decision to acknowledge all this information and to use my fear, sadness, and frustration as raw energy to transform into something more productive and helpful
_______________
“what can i do? what can i do? what do i do?” At this moment, I don't know how else to help other than to extend my services and fundraise as much as I can. There's only so much money we can donate as individuals so I thought i would reach out to my community. Until the end of June, % of my earnings from my “Stress and Anxiety Support meal plan” will go directly to multiple organizations supporting the people of Yemen during this time. It's really not much, but it's the least I can do
_______________
The meal plan is designed with key nutrients that tend to get depleted when we are stressed/anxious including zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins, which aren't a bad idea to include in  your diet esp. during a global pandemic
______________
If you're not in the position to buy a meal plan ($)/donate, please keep spreading the word! And if you want to repost, please repost directly from @soyouwanttotalkabout and give them credit for their amazing work. There's also a link in my bio with a lot of resources about what's going on in Yemen and how you can help - even with no money
_______________
Again… thank you for giving me this platform to speak on. I know it's probably not what you came to this page for but health and wellness extends to all humans and these are causes I deeply care about. So i TRULY appreciate and value your time&energy🥰

for me, that looks like:
speaking to myself with kindness,
honoring my cravings,
occasional pampering (face masks, sauna time, facials, massages),
getting enough sleep,
shutting down negative thoughts,
eating to feel good,
resting when my body is asking for it,
& MOVING from a place of love, celebration, and gratitude.

i first discovered @classpass summer of last year and have been an avid user ever since. why? because i don't have to commit to a single type fitness class and get to listen to my body instead, it's way more cost-effective, there's spa options available, it's super convenient if i want to try a new studio when traveling, and it gives me opportunities to try new things!

blake and i are in columbus today, and HE offered to sign up for @classpass, so we could try out a fitness class here together (i was honestly shocked when he suggested this lol). feeling sweaty and happy (hello post-workout endorphins!)!💦 now off to go eat more good food!

This is perfect for those days where you have less motivation or energy but you still want to make sure you get your body moving! It's made of really easy, mindful movements for your body, but you'll still feel the burn! What's great is that because these aren't high impact or stressful on your joints & body, it's not as daunting to think about doing & it allows you to REALLY focus on each movement & take your time with it. Perform each rep slowly, squeeze/tense your core, while focusing on the muscles you're using ~ also please note, I'm not a PT or professional so my form could be way off. I just thought I'd share this post in case it's helpful ✨

🔥 Save this to come back to it whenever you like 😋🔥

💤 side plank
💤 glute bridge
💤 leg raises
💤 plank
💤 oblique twists
💤 heel touches
💤 supermans
💤 single leg glute bridge (both sides)

now that i've set out a goal to increase my strength with more resistance training, i'm feeling more called to do as much passive asana as possible. it's been lovely  to move through different stages of my practice. 

i have personally just been taking classes from @omstarsofficial as well as trying out some youtube classes (search: yin yoga class). there are free resources all over the internet if you want to try!

It forces me to stay present in the moment, continuously pushes me and challenges me both mentally and physically, and I walk out of every single class feeling stronger and ready to take on the day.  I know that group classes are not for everyone, but if you're losing that drive to workout on your own like you used to, I challenge you to push yourself and go try a fitness class that you might not normally do.

As cheesy and overused as this quote is, it's the only thing that kept coming into my mind as the taxi was driving us away from the yoga school to the airport. My home for a month. Where strangers became family. Where practicing postures barely scratched the surface of the true meaning of yoga. Where I fell in love with my self again and again in each breath and stretch. I told myself I wasn't allowed to be sad until I left so I can enjoy the moment but my sadness from leaving pales to the gratitude I have for this wonderful time and the excitement I have for each person I met. I am much more happy that we all got to experience this together and I can't wait to see what light you beautiful souls spread throughout your life. You will touch lives you didn't even know you existed, and that makes my heart leap. Remember this experience but also live in the present moment because this is what is real right now.

There was a time in my life where I thought of working out as a chore or even a punishment, but I'm so glad to be at a place where exercise is something that I genuinely enjoy and do because I love myself instead of because I hate myself ❤️ Here are some things that I did to incorporate self care into my workout routine:

️⃣. Think about your “why”: Why are you working out? What is it doing for you? How does it make you feel?  It can be easy to get caught up in the numbers (number of reps, minutes, calories), but thinking about my “why” helped me track my progress in a more holistic way.

️⃣. Wear nice workout clothes: This might sound a little silly or materialistic, but when you wear something that makes you feel confident, it can really impact the quality of your workout.  Look good, feel good 😎

️⃣. Be your biggest fan: Chances are, you're your biggest critic. In the end, everything you do in your life is for you. The only person you are competing against is yourself, which means you get to set the rules and standards. Being your biggest fan isn't about bragging or being arrogant.  Rather, it is about showcasing your achievements and giving yourself a pat on the back for the wins in your life, big or small. Because if you don't do it, who will? ✨ 📸: @kaylabarnes

Doc ID: 6775, distribution: 0.0761042878011406 ; what i thought vs what i know about exercise ⬇️

i thought that to be “healthy”, i had to work out vigorously every single day with absolutely no rest. 

i thought that if i didn't break a sweat then a work out didn't “count”. 

i thought that being the girl who “loves fitness” and is “always in the gym” was the highest possible praise i could receive, and i strived for it with a relentless hunger.

i thought and i thought and i thought but i never took time to stop thinking and just listen to my body. i let my obsession with exercise snowball. i was infatuated with the idea that exercise could be used to burn off food i had eaten or to earn food i wanted to eat. i saw movement as a means to make myself smaller, which i wrongly believed meant healthier.

 years later, here's what i know.

i know that to be “healthy”, by my personal definition, i need to approach exercise from a place of love and grace. this means skipping workouts when i don't feel up to them, and resting deeply and often.

i know that low impact workouts and simple movement like walking all contribute to my health in a meaningful way.

i know that being the girl who loves her body for what it can do and not for what it looks like is the person i want to be every single day, because this girl is the happiest in all areas of life.

movement should be fun. it should be a celebration of life and strength. your healthiest self will not see exercise as a means to an end (punishment or a smaller body), but instead as a part of a happy life, not the entire life itself.

i promise if you're stuck in a hard place with exercise right now, that it gets better. please take care of yourself. rest when you need it. move how you want to, not how you feel pressured to. 

i hope this reaches anyone who needs the reminder xx

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I get this a lot since I used to do a lot of weight lifting, endurance sports, and intense exercise before making yoga my preferred exercise activity. I also had this worry when I realized I wouldn't be lifting weights at the gym while i went off for my yoga teacher training in India for a month. I was more excited to do yoga and leaving in a few weeks so i tucked that thought away to deal with later.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I came home after a whole month of no "intense" exercise. Instead i had a whole month of daily yoga and walking. I got comments that I've gotten leaner, i look stronger. I felt more limber and strong-- in the way I could hold up my own body weight for long periods of time with an even, smooth breath.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I felt more at peace with my body, too. One thing about a regular yoga practice is that it breaks my ego down and reminds me of what is most important. What self love really feels like. I wanted to prioritize my functionality and my ability to bend and move freely. I LOVE me some intensity, so I'll still play around with HIIIT and calisthenic workouts, kettlebell circuits, even get a day pass at the gym to throw around some weights. But you can bet that most days, I'm just doing yoga. Not just because it can build/maintain muscle and strength if I want it to, but because it makes me FEEL good. and when you feel good... you have this glow that automatically makes you LOOK good. No matter what size, what muscle mass %, no matter what weight.
.
A year later and i look at myself in the mirror and surprisingly, my body's kinda the same size. I have little less muscle definition, but i'm okay with that. What has changed is that I can look at myself without wanting to change anything. And I'm okay with whatever shape my body takes.
.
that's REALLY how yoga (among other things) has changed me.

where i learned that the physical yoga practice is a vessel for mental strength practice
that going % is not always better than going %
that happiness is not in an achievement but it just is
that the breath can always take you wherever you need to be

i went to Rishikesh after i graduated in  as a little gift to myself and loved it so much i went for advanced training at the same school  months after.  i didn't (and still don't) mean to become a teacher right away- i just wanted to learn about yoga a little bit deeper than i've been exposed to. i still have a lot of learning to do, but what i've learned has been slowly transforming me. 

i was just thinking about this time after a friend and i (that i met all the way across the world at my YTT) caught up and shared laughs and good bites. she and her boyfriend were in the room next to me, were both from california, vegan, and were both going into medical school afterwards. now we hang out in each other's living rooms and she talks about her real baby and i talk about my fur baby.

connections and events like that prove to me that life is more than random coincidences…

and if it ends up being coincidences at the end of it- at least i enjoyed it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 💕

I like to escape and avoid but I didn't feel right anywhere I looked for refuge.

then I went to india. I learned yoga- TRUE yoga. the stuff that you don't see. the connection between mind-body-spirit. the stuff you think is voodoo and unrealistic until you a c t u a l l y experience it.

there are a bunch of other things that have gotten me here obviously but I think yoga kick started and reinforces the not-so-new revelation that home is not external. home is you. it's wherever you are. it's wherever I am

Yoga has been so essential to me. it might seem rigid but getting in my practice every morning really helps ground me.  knowing that i'll have at least that mindful, mind body breath coordination daily has let me be more accepting of this huge shift in my daily life. also, making peace with the fact that i'll be spending less time on social media and making content has served my productivity so well. another thing— finding a place (or three) that I can really settle into an study has become essential to my work flow.

.
getting myself to start yoga this morning was so hard. i actually contemplated doing a workout instead of yoga. honestly getting to the gym early in the morning at this point in my life would probably be easier than diving into a yoga sequence. especially ashtanga, one that i've found to be more than bending and jumping.
.
its become more of a mental rather than a physical practice to me. when I resist it, I KNOW my subconscious is trying to stop me from being introspective. it's a telltale sign that my ego is trying to hide and go unnoticed so that I don't put it in check.
.
when i feel like i don't want to do yoga and force myself to do it anyway, feelings (such as unworthiness, feeling small, like a burden to others, feeling unaccomplished) and false beliefs about myself resurface.  these are all things that if left uncovered/undiscovered, pull me into a hole.
.
it's uncomfortable a LOT but so worth it at the end. even if nothing gets solved, even if all I do is realize “wow i actually felt like shit because of what happened two weeks ago,” I am at least % more aware than when I reluctantly began.
.
that's why daily practice to me is so important. I tend to bury feelings and hide from self deprecating thoughts so I don't have to face them. yoga brings everything to the front. yoga (slowly, surely, gradually) brings everything together.

but there are a lot of other things not in our control

i try to remind myself of this when things get turbulent: control what i can control.... let go & make peace with what is

i thought about this a bit during my practice. i used to have a stronger more consistent ashtanga yoga practice but i took along break last year. starting back up slowly means watching myself struggle with postures that were much easier before. 

while it's an opportunity to berate, be upset with, and be frustrated with myself.... it's an even bigger opportunity to lean into my patience and self compassion. also an opportunity to be extra grateful for muscle memory and growth and strength. it's also a huge exercise in humility and grace to accept what is here and work with it.

I don't want to only be a nicer person AFTER my asana practice. I want to be a nicer person before, throughout as well as after my practice. my aim is not to have a bad mood, stretch, and all of a sudden the problem is solved— my aim is to recognize an emotion/reaction, validate it, and move on with a relaxed heart. this is what my daily practice has taught me, although I am human and still get fired up for longer than you'd expect haha

it is kind of true that I am a “nicer” person after the introduction of yoga in my life, but I want the physical practice to be a TOOL to help me move through obstacles in my life off the mat the same way I move through postures in the series.

Idk about you, but I had the Monday blues today: lack of motivation, bloated after all the Christmas/NYE feasting & was honestly just feeling pretty sluggish & bleh.

But when I got to the gym today — first session of the year — I greeted a lovely man with a disability at the door & he completely refreshed my perspective & mindset. 

First of all, his aura was so positive, he was genuinely happy to be there & because of his disability, he crawled from machine to machine throughout his workout, even though his tremors made it increasingly more difficult, even though it seemed like his limbs worked against him, even though some people sadly stared as he grunted with every movement, he still pushed himself & got his body moving. 

It reminded me what a true blessing it is to be able to move my body. It never deserves punishment, only embracing.

I wanted to thank him for showing me his strength & perseverance, for inspiring me, encouraging me & reminding me of what's truly important. 

I appreciate these legs, for they take me wherever I need to go 🦵 

I appreciate my arms, because they hold my fav food, my fav people and all of my fav things 💪

I thought I would share a few things that are integral to yoga, starting with the  limbs. The  limbs of yoga  are the bread and (vegan) butter to the teachings of yoga. They are steps that act as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. They serve as a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline. They direct attention to one's health and help us to acknowledge the more spiritual aspects of ourselves.

Notice how asana, or postures, is only one of the . Yoga is truly a lifestyle that encompasses mindfulness and love for others and the self. Read more about it in Patanjali's “Yoga Sutra”! That's one of the books that are required in most yoga teacher training courses. 

Of course, I am just a baby in my yoga life so if you want to learn the true teachings of yoga (aka not just doing cool postures), my personal favorites for yoga wisdom are @larugayoga and @kinoyoga.

 and I did  minutes before i stopped myself and said: I don't want to.  Learning to stop myself from doing exercise just because i want to burn calories was very hard and still is. A few days ago i read a post on ig that said that one should not exercise at all during recovery until you have form a healthy relationship with it and THAT is a hard pill to swallow and it is taking me time to come to terms with it so i tried to find a middle-ground, and while it is not the best option at all and i do not condone anyone to follow my footsteps, i only do yoga when i want to for the time my body wants to…most of the time.  I think this topic of exercise is one that constantly slaps me in the face whenever i feel like my journey of recovery is done, that i am fine mentally and health wise. I am not but i will, and i know so because i want to be, so, i will continue to work with my relationship with yoga because is pretty neat and i really want it to be a plus on my life, not a form of punishment for my healthy habits that my ed voice deems bad.  Exercise is not about burning calories, i know that much :)

the mat i'm using was a gift from @okoliving (not spons). it's made with hand loomed, herbal dyed cotton with skin-soothing medicinal herbs & flowers. mine is the jade & cream weaved with  types of holy basil (Tulsi), neem leaves, turmeric, aloe vera, soap nut, false daisy, plantain wood ash, curry leaf. it's great for restorative/yin, but in my opinion not the most optimal for dynamic practices (such as ashtanga) unless  you wet it a little bit or come onto the mat with damp hands and feet to create some grip. the mats are also washable! see more at @okoliving 😘

Those who LEARN what they don't know... So they can TEACH what they know. I am still in my "learning" stages, and I feel I will be for a very long time
-
On the outside the primary series might seem boring and repetitive with nothing else to offer. BUT I keep learning more and more every time I step on the mat and practice. I keep feeling new areas of my body and in my emotions that I would not have uncovered before. One thing I know is that yoga is a life long school. I don't think I will ever stop being a student and learning from it. there's so much more that I can learn from this particular primary series and that's why even though I've learned the secondary series I don't feel like I am ready for those lessons yet… If that makes any sense I've been getting a lot of questions about whether or not I still practice secondary series and I don't because I still want to squeeze out more from a regular primary series practice before I move onto the next thing

Any other ashtangis feel like this? What are your experiences or thoughts about moving onto the next series? I wish I were still in Rishikesh so I can ask all of my teachers there all these questions. But for now… Instagram

Doc ID: 9268, distribution: 1.0 ; I've never actually been into ashtanga yoga until I learned about the yoga philosophies and got into it. I didnt even know exactly what it was. Ashtanga has  different series that are followed the same each time that focuses on moving into each posture with the breath. I love the structure of it and the fact that even if you memorize the whole series, theres always something to improve on, somewhere we can go deeper. I love how when it all comes together, it looks like a dance. More importantly, it feels like a dance I am having with myself. Breathing with me, feeling every part of me, trusting myself to go deeper, trusting myself to take a break and breath, embracing each drop of sweat and each pull of my muscles. I find myself falling in love more and more with each step of the dance. #rishikesh #rishikeshdiaries #applesandamandas #travel #india #yoga #rishikeshyoga #yogaeverydamnday #ashtanga

Doc ID: 8852, distribution: 1.0 ; After a long weekend class session (once a month we have class am-pm Saturday/Sunday), learning Sanskrit and the History and Evolution of Ayurveda, I walked into the kitchen and told Luke “I LOVE what i am learning.” I was a little shocked at myself after I said that.

I just didn't think i'd feel this way so fast. Before choosing to study Ayurveda (and going the Western Med route) I thought i'd have to grit my teeth through classes and material that is, yes, important, but not something I would use in my own practice. 

Saying so boldly that I LOVE what I'm learning was a big confirmation of my own growth and self acceptance. I'm really proud of myself for choosing what I want and trusting in my choice rather than staying within the lines that others have drawn for me. The last time I felt like this was when I was studying yoga (doesn't it all make sense?!).

When it comes to school, I'm pretty good at pretending something is important or interesting just to get a good grade. Actually enjoying the subject matter, on the other hand, is a different feel. 

I love knowing that the information I'm learning can help empower my future clients (you, maybe?) to take care of their bodies and heal with modalities that are gentle and natural. I love knowing that I don't have to be ~every~ type of practitioner to make sure a client gets the most thorough care. I love knowing that part of being a healer is integrating your gifts with the gifts of other providers who are equally as passionate in their field.

I'm sharing this because I have a feeling some people out there are also on the fence, teetering between what others expect of you and what truly resonates with you. I can't make that choice for you, but just know that it's never too late to choose yourself and your happiness ❤️

Doc ID: 8805, distribution: 1.0 ; my first and biggest teacher on what true fitness is for ~me~

was yoga asana

previously i thought exercise was just to be “fit” so i can “have” abs. 

then i got on a yoga mat and realized how hard it is to actually hold up my own body weight in plank. and i kept on coming onto the mat and found that  seconds became , then , then  (still difficult lol) minute. 

i started to notice older people do yoga and how unconcerned they were with the way they looked… they just wanted to feel good.

so now, when i set my own fitness goals, i think about longevity and sustainability:

✨i want to be able to do things like tie my shoes, breathe in downward dog, and stand on my tippy toes when i'm hanging out with my future grandchildren

✨i want my joints to be free of pain so we can walk around the parks, beaches, etc. together

so i keep these in mind in my own movement practices whether yoga or weight training, because time goes by fast and i will be at that age sooner than i know. 

my body will look however it is going to look, but can i keep up with a lil grand baby crawling up and down the stairs?

this is why i prioritize

mobility,
flexibility,
smooth,
& easy movements.

and when have the space and time, i'll throw in the booty goal too.

Doc ID: 2569, distribution: 1.0 ; MY CURRENT WEEKLY GYM ROUTINE 🤍 [ad] 

You ask, I provide 😋 I figured I'd start creating posts for my most frequently asked questions - if you have any, leave them below!

After  years of health and fitness, I've finally been able to create a structure that is flexible, enjoyable, something I don't dread doing and one I believe I can maintain long-term. To me, my goals aren't crazy, they're realistic and achievable. My focus is no longer physique-based, but more on moving my body to feel strong and maintain my level of fitness. So this is just what works for me 💪🏼

What are your goals? And what's your favourite way to get your body moving? Let me know below! 🤩

My gym routine isn't just about the muscle groups I train, it also includes a few of my favourite supplements (along with a balanced diet) as well. If I ever want a lil energy boost, I use @macrmike tropical mixed berry or lychee berry pre-workout before I head to the gym, then I sip on the tropical mango plant-based aminos throughout each workout, these contain electrolytes, vitamins and aminos which are all important for muscle development, recovery and strength. I usually re-fuel with some vanilla buttercream protein oats afterwards. I like to stay nourished throughout the day with plenty of nutritious but delicious meals/snacks too! I've included an example in the post 🥰

You can shop the @macrmike performance, baking mixes, nut butters & protein range through the link in my bio & enjoy % off with my code: AMB-BREE xo

P.s. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm not a PT so my form may not be perfect and I'm not advising you guys that this is the best routine or way to workout, this is purely just to share what I do to maintain my goals and perhaps give you some inspiration for your own workout routine. Hope this helps! ⚡️

 I have a history of using the gym for evil and really overdoing it. How I am right now after avoiding the gym for so long, is very out of shape and weak and pathetic. Muscles? Who's she. Stamina? Don't know her. Physical health?? make it make sense. 
 cont. under read more:  Anyways with this self isolation thing going on part of me wants to help myself get in better shape, I mean my lb dog makes my arms give out. when I say im out of shape, i mean my muscles are threads and going up  steps leaves me winded. Im not talking about “summer body toned” i mean literally i have like no strength at all my muscles are just paper. I cant even stand in the kitchen to cook without needing to sit down before I pass out. 

But how do I get healthy when I cant even control myself in exercise mode? Theres such a thin line between “im doing the correct amount and thats perfectly fine” and “work out until all i see is white and I wake up on the floor”

I just want to be normal. I want to have normal strength. Normal stamina. I want my body to be human. Instead Im a soggy tissue and trying to better myself only ends in the eating disorder taking over. I feel that way about ever attempt to better myself.. work out? Ed ruins it. Eat healthy? Ed ruins it. Eat more? Ed ruins it. Eat less? Ed ruins it. Drink more water? Ed ruins it. Every time I try to just be normal, Ed pushes it to the extreme in any direction and ruins it. I look normal. talking about it with people isnt really helpful. No one believes me and they always try to convince me that im lying. They overestimate my abilities just because of how i look. bro theres no muscle under my skin its just fat. take a squeeze lmao not even lying…. I wish I could change it. I used to play sports wtf.. Ive been trying to do At Home work outs… I hate it. Ive always hated exercising. I only did it for hours to punish myself. It has never been enjoyable. And at home Im struggling to get anything going, because i hate it so much but i also am afraid if I give effort im going to overdo it like always. There's no balance. Its shitty no matter what I do so I tend to get ultra depressed and avoid it.

-
So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don't know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I've mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These  exercise I did for  minute each, and repeated the whole circuit  times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise  // Lat pull down //  minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise  // Seated chest fly //  minute
Keep your arms slightly bent and shoulder blades pinned back.
Exercise  // Flat chest press //  minute
Don't lock your elbows at the top, have a slight arch in your back and press your feet firmly against the ground. 
Exercise //  Low row //  minute
Pull your elbows in and back, and hold then the squeeze for a second or so to feel the burn.

It's going to be a set of four upper body exercises, so not very many, but I do them as supersets as I will explain in the caption, and my arms are shaking by the end of it (which you can see quite clearly in the videos) 😂

The reason why I want to start posting videos like this is to not only give you some workout inspiration, but also help you guys out if you've not used gym machines in the past. Before my brother started helping me out, I had no clue how to use any of the machines. I took a lot of time trialling different ones and getting the form right before I started putting together some mini-workouts. That way I could make sure I was isolating and working the right muscle, and just building my confidence using machines and weights in the gym (which can be a very male-dominated area 😅)! I'm hoping that I'll be able to explain how to use each machine correctly and what it should be doing. A lot of this knowledge is being channelled from @matt.j.white so big shout out to my not so little brother anymore (who actually turns  today 🎉). He also filmed all my videos and did a pretty good job 😏 Watch this space people✌🏻

_______
i noticed a similarity with social media. the more time i spent scrolling through my feed filled with certain images and videos, i found a subconscious pull to shape my own actions and goals to that. whether it was fitness, beauty, fashion, meals, hobbies, etc. the more i surrounded my mind with outside influences, the more i wanted to do the same
_______
don't get me wrong, i defffffffff am not immune to trends. i fucking love these infographics all over IG right now for example. i've actually always loved doing this kinda graphic stuff but never knew i could apply it to my page in a useful way until i saw other people do it. i think they're interesting and very useful for future reference
_______
i just am more conscious about who i follow and why. i try to not spend too much time “watching” and “absorbing” the works of others as it hampers my own creative process/development
_______

for example, this is my body now- without trying to change or shape anything. once i stopped surrounding myself with all the “body” goals i used to scroll through, i found this new appreciation and acceptance where i am right now
_______
i love appreciating the works of others and sharing their creations with the world. i love raising other people up. i just don't feel the need to label anyone or anything as “goals” because trends and influences come and go. what stays is that quiet voice that reminds us over and over who we truly are.

i always knew that i should workout from a place of love, but it honestly didn't fully click in my head until pretty recently.  for my entire life, being active was solely a way to "be better" whether that was through competing in sports, to look a certain way, or to just be “fitter”, which PSA: do not make you better. it wasn't until a few months ago, after i had gone through many phases of complete exercise burnout and around the same time that i went "all in", that i decided to let go of ALL expectations i set for myself in the gym and on how my body looked that my mindset changed. i'm not exactly sure when the switch happened, but my love for movement and this body of mine has never been greater.
——
some weeks, i make it to the gym  times, some weeks, i go  times.  EVERY week, i listen to and honor how much and what kind of movement my body wants and always give myself grace because at the end of the day, working out is a celebration, a privilege, and something to be incredibly grateful for 🌟

but recently, i've stopped leaning toward what my body looks like as a gauge of love. i still love my body, but not for what i can see as much as for what i feel. i ask myself this:
.
.
what can my body do?
.
.
it can finally hold *decent* handstands (i've been practicing for months)! my core is strong enough to hold me up, even when things get flipped upside down. .
.
it can endure a brutal but amazing training session @tonehouse each week (and gets better each time, i thinkkkk)! these classes aren't daunting anymore. they're therapeutic and empowering! .
.
it can fill out clothes for a woman and not a child. it can stand for longer than five minutes without seeing stars and triggering faint spells. it can send a hunger signal to my brain without fear of rejection. .
.
it can give to and receive others. hugs, laughs, smiles. it can see it's own reflection in a mirror and feel...acceptance. .
.
my eating disorder started as a pursuit for a tiny waist and a flat stomach. you know what?
.
.
it nearly took my life.
.
.
i was so obsessed with what my body looked like and not what it could do. when i was extremely underweight my body couldn't do anything. it could barely breathe and walk without discomfort. .
.
well, i've finally given up on such a shallow goal. when i shifted my mindset to focusing on what my body could do in good health, i fell in love with the abilities it granted me...
.
.
and they're sure as hell not worth cashing in for a body that lacks the strength, heart, passion, and LIFE that come with the body i have today.
.
.
if this is the body that brings me the greatest peace internally, then i accept it as it is. healing is a process, always in flux, but when you hit the milestones like this one...you realize it's worth every second ♥️

My fitness is still pretty good from all the running I've done, but how my arms will feel is another matter. Also, the pool has limitations on the number of swimmers allowed in and I may not be able to thrash up and down in my usual way. I'm not sure if there's rules on overtaking or not. Basically I hope the fast lane is empty so that I can have it all to myself!

I track my period alongside all my other health data using my @fitbituk_ireland, and this year, unlike , I managed to keep my period all throughout my marathon training!!! This was such a big win for me you guys, and I think the following things really helped:
-
🦋 Get at least - hours of good. quality. sleep 💤
🦋 Eat well balanced meals, with carbs, protein aaaaand fats. Eat the peanut butter ok!!
🦋 Listen to your body and take rest the you need it. Missing a workout or changing your plan is not the end of the world, period.
🦋 Most of my running training (about %) is base training at an easy-steady pace.
🦋 If you're getting small injuries all the time then please stop and get better instead of pushing through.
🦋 Re-fuel as soon as you can after a workout, and quick ways to do this immediately are by making a protein shake, eating a banana or spooning out some peanut butter (the dopamine hit is honestly divine my friends 🤩)
🦋 If you're hungry, no you don't just need to drink water, please go and get some food!

Doc ID: 15906, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Just done the couch to k and now looking to slowly extend to k/ get faster at k. Any advice on training plans/apps?  Answer: There's a second app by couch to k, that's called “k trainer by CK” which I believe is meant to be good. Or there's several other apps that offer k training plans. I have a garmin watch and it has k, k and half marathon training plans included on it for free, and you can enter how many times a week you want to run and what time you'd like to aim for, and it targets the programme specifically for you. Plus it keeps track of all your workouts and it links with strava too. I've really enjoyed using it and found it helpful and it's hugely improved my running. So I recommend that if you're looking for a running watch/gadget - maybe as a treat for completing ck!

Doc ID: 17120, distribution: 1.0 ; I did the parkrun this morning. H and the baby came to cheer me on, which was lovely. I've been in a slow running phase since April, just can't seem to find my speed again. It's probably related to not really having much chance midweek to get out for a run. I was .min slower than my pb on this course, but I was still happy with my time. It was  mins faster than last week (that was a slow two-baby-exhaustion run) so I feel good about that. Plus it helps me believe I'm not dying from some mysterious illness that I don't yet know about. Whenever my exercise tolerance goes down, I have a list of conditions I immediately convince myself I have.

Shall I a) put on my comfy lounging around clothes or b) put on my running gear in the hope that it might motivate me to get out for a run? Since we are in lockdown, there's not a whole lot of choice for an activity besides going out to walk or run. I can't swim this evening as I usually would, since the gym is closed, so maybe a run would be good.  Ok, I've talked myself into it. Running clothes it is.

Doc ID: 15480, distribution: 1.0 ; I've been doing a Garmin k training plan during lockdown and now I've reached the end of the  weeks. Coach Greg is very confident I can now run k in  minutes but I don't actually think I can. And because I don't think I can do it, I don't want to even try.  Obviously I'm not doing a k race because because there aren't any races on at the moment, but I had planned to just go out and run the distance anyway. My plan is to do it tomorrow, if I can psych myself up to actually get out there. I've not run for a few days to give my muscles and joints recovery time so I can give my best effort but they still feel stiff. I'm just going to have to go for it and see how it goes. I'm trying to tell myself it's not a big deal (which it isn't!) but I hate not achieving my goals. I guess I consider this practice at that.

Thankfully it's a rest day with no running planned, but I think I will have to miss tomorrow's run if it still hurts like this. I always can run through the pain but I'm trying to employ my sensible mind and know that it wouldn't be the best idea.  The moral is that you can still run in your s but you will hurt pretty much constantly.

Doc ID: 17214, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: If just running around the house can contribute to your weight loss, should you be running miles or doing whatever other exercise you're doing? It seems like you're picking and choosing what you want to focus on "changing.". 🤔 Answer: Come back to me when you've spent hrs housebound with two babies, and then tell me that the chance to go run in the fresh air for - minutes on your own isn't the most amazing feeling and goes a long way to helping you stay sane. The exercise is not going anywhere. It's a healthy thing for me. My exercise levels have been very steady for a long while, and increased levels of running round the house can't replace a run outside or a swim. I just need to fuel that exercise properly, and that's what's been hard the last couple of weeks.

Doc ID: 16171, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you always run outside and never at the gym? Why? Just really curious, I personally love running on a treadmill but hate running outdoors!  Answer: I haven't run on a treadmill for ages. Running outside is so wonderful - fresh air, familiar but changing scenery, uphills and downhills, things to look at, routes to explore…. I can't imagine ever choosing a treadmill in preference. The only reason I might run at the gym is if the weather was really awful. Plus I'm training for a half marathon and that's running outside, so what better place to practice than outside! But in the end, everyone's different, and I'm happy that you love running on a treadmill 😊

Doc ID: 15715, distribution: 1.0 ; One mile time trial  My k running training schedule had me run a one mile time trial for the last two Sundays. The first time wasn't so bad because I'd never done a time trial before ever so I didn't know what was coming. The second time, yesterday, oh my goodness it was hard. I went out too fast and then just wanted to give up and walk 🥵  There's a really convenient road loop not too far from me that's exactly a mile long but the corner I started from means that the first half of the mile is slightly (only slightly) downhill and the second half is slightly uphill, so even harder to run. If I have to do it again, I'm going to start from a different corner!! I was so relieved when I'd finished and my schedule revealed next Sunday's run and it was a long run rather than another time trial.

Doc ID: 15208, distribution: 1.0 ; I had a fab run this morning with my running mummy friends - we ran a circular loop of . miles. It felt so good although it was about the limit of the distance I can run, I couldn't have gone much further. Unfortunately I twisted my ankle at the  miles mark.

Doc ID: 15358, distribution: 1.0 ; Running  I've started a new running training plan although it's not really a plan because I'm trying to have a break from a hardcore plan and just have a bit of focus to my runs instead. It uses heart rate instead of running pace and that feels more gentle and takes into account the varying terrain I'm usually running on.  It will make my easy runs more easy because I'm trying to keep my heart rate down. Hopefully this will mean I hurt less afterwards. I've done almost  months hard running training, so I'm ready to ease off a bit. I don't want to destroy my joints. I want to still be able to run next year. I really like running.

I do not want to get injured. I committed to doing this in a healthy way and I will do my best to stick to that. Also a little part of my brain is still crying about not doing RED January. I was really tempted but I knew I couldn't do that and the half marathon training and stay mentally healthy. Ironic since it's for mental health, but running every day for a month would actually be likely to send me spiralling into a relapse. And that, brain, is why we are not doing it.

It was going great until my garmin battery died at . miles 😭 I had to use Strava on my phone to get the extra . mile and now my upload is all a mess. But I did it and that's what counts. A bonus side effect of running that far is that I need to eat a lot of food to replace the calories and to stop my hunger going haywire. I don't run to burn the calories but when I'm in a good place with food, I like that it happens.  I finished my jigsaw and this afternoon collected another one I'd bought from a local selling site. And I'm reading a great book on my new kindle - The Other Wife by Claire McGowen, so now it's early evening and I'm sitting in the garden snuggled under a blanket with a gin and tonic and I'm about to read some more.

I'm reminding myself missing meals is not helpful and will only make coping with everything else going on more difficult. So I am doing ok, but it's taking effort. I'm also having to give myself grace over running. I like to get out and run a few times a week, but at the moment having a gap in my day to run and having motivation to run are not really coinciding. There's days when I'm not really moving much at all, I think a couple of days I've not even gone outside, which is very unusual for me. But it's only for two weeks and nothing awful will happen to me if I don't run much for two weeks.  Basically adoption transitions are hard and all-consuming. You're looking after a baby, and then you're looking after adults learning to look after the baby. And you're doing it from dawn till dusk day after day. We have all hit a bit of an exhaustion wall today so we are having a very low key afternoon. One more day to do and then a day off, before the final push to the end. I can't even wish for it to be over though because that will mean baby leaving us and that's just sad too. Much emotions.

But I carry on, just rather wearily, like ploughing through treacle. I did the parkrun this morning while H had the babies and took the car to get a new tyre. The tyre took longer than expected but he did eventually manage to meet me after the parkrun and we went for a coffee in the same outdoor cafe as yesterday. Parkrun was a slow one. I knew I didn't have the energy to push myself so I just took it steady but even so my legs were running on empty. I think I am probably exerting more calories than I'm taking in, even though I'm stubbornly pushing myself to eat three meals a day and mostly succeeding. I think I should eat more but my rigid brain doesn't want to bend that way. This afternoon we have hung out at home, taking it in turns to entertain the babies and do jobs. I managed a nice period of one-handed jigsaw doing (I was bouncing baby  in the bouncy chair with the other hand) outside in the warm weather, so that was good. A little bit of (almost) me-time. H and I also took it in turns to each have a short nap on the sofa. Now it's the evening. We might get a Chinese takeaway later but H and the girls are out, and I am home with two sleeping babies, so I'm waiting for the others to get back. I'm sitting with the remaining mess of the day around me, and ignoring it while I drink a glass of white wine and try and catch up with the babies' daily diaries. I'm supposed to write in them every day but I'm pretty rubbish at remembering and always end up writing a few days at a time. I really hate to admit it, but I think two babies for three weeks may be my limit.

I didn't plan it that way, but I went to parkrun (got a PB, yay!!) and then came home and looked at the weather forecast because I heard rumours of a big STORM approaching. Seriously looks like it's going to be hard to even stay upright never mind run, so in the afternoon after I'd done an hour of maths tutoring, I popped back out to do my  minute “easy run”. It is easy, it's at a very steady pace, I just put my headphones on and trot along enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.

I can't think about much else until it's done though. Still running as per my half marathon training plan. Yesterday I did some things called Stride Repeats. I have no idea if I did them right. I read some stuff and watched a video on YouTube and I'm still a bit hazy about the differences between stride repeats and speed repeats and intervals and things like when the training instructions say “challenging run; fast pace x minutes/mile ; no sprinting”…. I'm not sure how to run challenging and fast without sprinting. At that pace I am sprinting 😭😂.

So I've been out of running for about  weeks now, and I'm only just starting to get back into it slowly. Don't get me wrong, it sucks not being able to do the things you love, buttttt. In the past I used to get so frustrated with an injury just because I feel the *need* to exercise.
-
I used to do literally anything and everything to keep moving: push through pain, delay the healing by just continuing to run, orrrr cycle a tonne for example, even though I'm not the biggest fan of just staring at a blank wall whilst spinning my legs 😅
-
For context, I basically came off with an injury after my k run in December last year. And tendonitis is definitely not something that heals overnight annoyingly. But this has been the first time (in my life!!) when I've truly surrendered and just given my body the time it needs to rest. And most importantly, I haven't felt at all bad about it at 👏🏻 all 👏🏻

If you also find yourself in an unhealthy relationship with food, your body and exercise, then I definitely encourage you to reach out and get help, because you really don't want to live the rest of your life trapped in that bubble!

My run wasn't too great–the weather is really starting to get to me. But I'm still proud of the fact that I went running at all! I was so, so close to changing my mind when I started grabbing for my workout clothes, and when I started running, I almost convinced myself to stop early and walk instead. But I pushed through!

-
Now I haven't completed that many races in my life ok. But from what I've heard, road marathons are the toughest distance to run . . . and I wouldn't question that at all 😅 Both times I've run London marathon it definitely hasn't been easy. I've pushed my body to the limit, but wow the km of Phuket marathon were a whole other ball game the other day!!!
-
A am start. Crazy heat, hills, humidity and a heart rate way too high, it was a recipe for disaster I won't lie 🤨😳 We both started off too fast, and everything quickly went downhill at K into the race. At that point I also had to sadly call my race over, because both our legs were cramping and I felt very nauseas. I was burping like a baby you guys (no joke 😂) and nothing was staying down too easily, my gels and even water 😔
-
Now running in Thailand, or anywhere hot in the world, should never be taken lightly. It's crazy out here you guys. But Sunday's race was such an experience. Both mentally and physically I was definitely challenged, and I cannot wait to share this video with you all so you can truly feel my pain as the sun was rising over Laguna (which truly is stunning, I promise) 😍

And you might find this hard to believe, but I truly loved running that race the other day. The best part was being able to run with Angelo, basically for the whole race, and crossing the finish line with our names being called out (representing Great Britain woo 😆) was so so cool I can't lie.

It's the first time I've ever used Garmin Coach, and I had to do the same run THREE times before I figured out how to connect it to the training plan 🙄 At this rate, I will be able to run a full marathon and a half by the time the plan is complete. Thankfully today's run was only a five minute one so it was easy to repeat.

Doc ID: 15945, distribution: 1.0 ; I finished my half marathon training schedule!!  So even though my race is cancelled I thought I'd still get out and run the distance. I had a vague route planned to stay local to my house but it turned out to be not quite long enough so the last few miles were made up of random running on side streets (all appropriately socially distanced, of course). I think I'd definitely be slightly faster in an actual race with spectators and a defined route - and also if I wasn't so sleep deprived and if I'd been more careful about adequate pre-race nutrition I'm proud of my running achievements over the last three months. I never thought I could run the distances and the speeds I've run. I don't know if I'll ever be able to run a half marathon as fast again as I would have done this one. Certain factors just aligned over these three months that meant I could fully commit to training. Who knows whether that'll happen again. But let me look at the positives - I trained in a healthy way, I didn't get obsessed or let the eating disorder run away with it, I stuck to the training plan, I maintained my weight, I paid attention to my nutrition… lots of wins there. Super proud of myself 🙌

An absolute dream of mine would be to one day run a sub- minute K 🥺 . . . but for now I'm very chuffed with yesterday's time of : 🙈 My best K before this was : so I definitely knocked off a good chunk of time, and I actually think that doing a little warm-up run to the park itself really helped 👌🏻

The total distance for my long run (with Park Run in the middle) was K and all the details are on my @strava 🤓 This isn't at all an ad, I just love Park Run and so this video is your calling to go and find one near you, ANYwhere in the world 🌎 🙌🏻 They are super friendly (dogs included 🐶), it's a really fun atmosphere and running with others really helps push you to run faster if that's your goal 😉 Oh and they're free 😏

Doc ID: 15475, distribution: 1.0 ; I did it!  This morning I did my end-of-training-plan k run. I imagined I was going to do a parkrun, although I didn't run a parkrun route because the parks are so busy at the moment. So I got up and did all the pre-parkrun things I usually do and that helped me get in the mindset of going out to run k. It also made it feel less daunting because I don't really get stressed out before parkruns.  I didn't quite manage it in  minutes, but I was just over  and a half minutes. Strava tells me that is a k PB so I'll take that 🙌 I think the parkrun where I ran slightly faster probably was measured a bit short as it didn't register as a k on my garmin. Anyway I felt like dying while I was running and had to use some mental toughness to keep going but now it's over I am feeling awesome. Tired out but awesome. I'm glad I pushed myself to do it. I'm going to try and have a week or so off running I think to give my joints some recovery time. I've done two  week training plans just about back to back since the start of  and run  miles. I've read about training plans where you adjust your pace to keep your heart rate in certain zones, so I might try one of those next. They apparently improve your baseline fitness and don't involve a lot of fast running. But for now, the sofa calls, along with my book I'm trying to get read for book group tomorrow evening. I'm off for some restful reading.

Doc ID: 11138, distribution: 1.0 ; A little post K run photoshoot because . . . why not? And of course, Bali and Java had to get involved. I was on such a high yesterday after finishing my last kilometre because I felt so good the whole way (which doesn't always happen let me just say that first). But I was smiling to myself under the sun, I felt super energised, and I was honestly loving the podcast I was listening to all about vegan athletes.

Feeling super inspired, I thought I'd answer the question WHY I RUN 🏃🏻‍♀️ I want to film a 'running story' video and also a Q&A all about running (both are on my growing list of videos to film 🙈), but I thought I'd share just a few reasons here first.
-
 // It's a reason to go outdoors and get fresh air. Personally, the UK spring weather is usually optimal for me: not too hot, not too cold, a bit of a breeze. But whether the heat feels claustrophobic or my butt cheeks are hideously numb, it's fresh air and that's what matters most to me.
-
 // Recently, I'm running with the half marathon in mind. And that means I'm working to beat my previous time, run faster, or run a longer distance. Challenging myself with running has made it so much more exciting and rewarding.
-
 // I think everyone's probably heard of endorphins. With any form of exercise you get that positive feeling afterwards, but for me, endorphins are on an all time high after I run.
-
 // Stress relief. At my desk, there's a million-and-one things going on inside my head all at the same time. Whilst on a run, it's a chance for me to escape that chaotic bubble and just be in my own company.
-
 // Running is for anyone and everyone. For sure you have to train pretty intensely to be a pro runner like Mo Farah, but it's so easy to just put on some trainers and run. And simply run for fun. I also love running to explore and find new places, which is something I loved doing in Australia (except in Darwin . . . yeah, about that 😭🏥).

Happy Monday my friends. I hope this possibly gave you a small dose of inspo to maybe go on a run this week 💪🏻

Doc ID: 16042, distribution: 1.0 ; Running Madness  I've been really trying to eat more carbs and I think it's paying off. My runs this week have felt so much better than last weeks. My legs have felt good and my times have been faster. Today I was scheduled to do a  hour long run. I set off and it was going really well. One of those runs where I just felt like I could keep going and going. I was about  minutes in, going steady back in the direction of my car when I got a phone call from H to say my tutee had arrived 🤯 Eek, I had forgotten all about her coming today. She only comes once a month, but I had been thinking about her earlier so I don't know how it all went clean out of my brain. I blame the sleep deprivation. H had to come out in his car to scoop me up from my run. I was really gutted to have to cut it short because it was feeling so good. I put a sprint on to get as far as I could in the last  minutes or so, and surprised myself by how much of a spurt I could do after  miles. When I'm actually running the half marathon, I will have to think of tutoring at this same distance point and visualise the same situation and whoomf! off I will go. In the end, I made it to . miles before H caught me up in the car. He whizzed me home (I was very grateful!), and I spent an hour tutoring Circle Theorem, before shoving my (cold damp) running clothes back on and running  miles down the road to rescue the car from where I'd parked it at the start of the run. Finally made it home just in time to eat tea cooked by d. Madness, I tell you.

Doc ID: 15968, distribution: 1.0 ; Lockdown Day   These lockdown days seem to get so full up of stuff that I barely have time to get on tumblr, which is sad because it makes me feel disconnected from all my tumblr friends. Eating has been somewhat better today, although after doing PE with Joe (and d, d and d), I went for a run (my one allowed daily outing for exercise). It was the penultimate run of my half marathon training schedule, a tempo run with  minutes warm up jog then  minutes at fast pace and  minutes cool down jog. My legs were dead, I don't think Joe's PE was a good pre-run idea. For the first time ever in the entire training schedule I skipped the optional extra part of the run, so I only did  minutes fast. Then walked home for the cool down. I didn't eat enough yesterday and I exercised too energetically this morning and it came back to bite me at pm when I crashed out on the sofa. So none of that was great.  On the positive side, the weather was so sunny and warm today, I started to wonder if I should have worn suncream for my run. It's been beautiful and we've been sitting out in the garden enjoying it. I want to write about therapy - last week and this week. I'm hoping I'll have time to do that tomorrow. I am in need of a peaceful day just pottering around rather than frantically trying to do jobs and take phone calls in between the baby's schedule and trying to keep on top of everything as much as I can for the girls. In other news, we got Disney+ yesterday and everyone is very happy. I'm not really bothered about watching it (no time haha) but I'm happy that everyone else is happy. Since the gym is shut, we get a rebate of our gym membership which will more than cover the Disney+ cost so that was our justification. Plus we need things to do in these lockdown times. Of course our daily appointment with Boris at pm. He wanted to be remembered for Getting Brexit Done, and instead he'll be remembered for Getting Us Through The Coronavirus Pandemic. I don't like him and his party and policies but I do think he's doing a pretty good job overall of this. And Chris Whitty and the other guy (Prof someone) will be up for knighthoods when this is all over I'm sure. This evening we had a Zoom with our church group and that was lovely to see everyone and give thanks for the good things in our lives and pray for each other's needs. Very encouraging. I'm heading for bed very soon now so I'll say goodnight. Stay safe and healthy everyone if you can x

Doc ID: 16904, distribution: 1.0 ; Run  I went for a run this evening to try out my new garmin. It was a lovely evening for a run, beautiful sunset, it just felt great to be out there running. I wasn't running because I felt I had to, or because I felt I needed to compensate for anything. Just running for the pleasure of running.  Of course it doesn't feel physically fantastic all the time when I'm actually running. The route I ran is uphill for the first couple of miles and it's hard work, but then it gets easier. After about three miles I got into my stride and was just cruising along feeling good.  Six miles down and I made it home, walked d out to a babysitting job, and then came home and ate a bowlful of creamy lentils and pork (Thankyou hello fresh) The garmin did its thing and I managed to make it record my run and upload it to strava. Whoop! Now I'm in my pjs and watching the final episode of Sink or Swim/Stand up to cancer. I've loved this little series. Totally inspiring.

-
Because we all love a good camera roll dump, here are some photos I took throughout my training 🏃🏻‍♀️ Even though I didn't manage to get to the @newbalance x @sportsshoes tent at the end of the race . . . because we ended up in the paramedic tent at the end feeling very spaced out and confused (😰), working on this campaign alongside my training has been so much fun 🤩 The kit was epic and whilst running can be a lonely sport, I managed to make some great friends as part of it - shoutout Chloe and Paula 😉
- 
Even though I found out I was running the marathon in April of this year, I only officially started training roughly three months ago because I had some foot issues, classic Holly 🙄😅 I did also start out with a running coach, however this didn't continue throughout. I ran four times a week consistently for the majority of my training, with each of my sessions being varied, and my long runs were always part of my Sunday routine. The longest distance I tackled before the race was km and I started using my energy gels when I was running for longer than  minutes 💦
-
Coming down with an achilles injury with only a week to go really did get me down, however now that I've crossed the finish line I can definitely say that my training really did pay off! I ran so much faster than I expected and I don't think I would have been able to do it without the crowds. I knew they would be good, but not *that* good, and wow, people literally screaming your name is *the* best form of motivation ever ok, period 🙌🏻
-
I answered a tonne of questions that you guys sent in on my story the other day in today's video, so head over to YouTube to give it a watch! I have a lot of resting still to do and whilst my injury is healing I'll be exploring other forms of movement for now, but running will always have a special place in my heart 🥰 I'm super excited for more challenges in the future 😏

Doc ID: 16015, distribution: 1.0 ; Even though my half marathon is cancelled 😭 I'm determined to see the training schedule out to its finish. Here's yesterday's run and today's run - I'm very much in need of a rest day tomorrow! Yesterday's run was a steady pace for hr  and then  mins fast and  mins very fast (plus warm up and cool down). Today's run was just  mins steady pace. I listened to a podcast instead of music for the first time while running, and was pleased to find I could concentrate on it pretty well. I have actually got pretty good at running and don't know in what way I will carry it on when this training cycle is over. Maybe I'll follow a new training schedule to improve my km time. I've really loved checking each run off on my garmin and looking back at my stats for each run.

Doc ID: 11037, distribution: 0.237624479812075 ; Achilles injury update 🏃🏻‍♀️👟
-
We're just over two weeks out from the London Marathon and I'm still not back running, which is *totally fine* (I need to emphasise that)!!! In the past this would have realllllllly stressed me out, but at the moment I'm just exploring different forms of exercise 💪🏻 I'm mostly on my spin bike, walking on flat ground and strength training 🏋🏻‍♀️
-
Even though my physio said that my achilles isn't as bad as he expected it to be after running all of . miles 🙈 . . . I am adamant that I'm not running until it is fully healed. Fully healed, I repeat. I've learned a lot from my mistakes in the past and my biggest advice with injuries is to: ️⃣ Stop as soon as you can ️⃣ See a professional if possible ️⃣ Rest, ice, compress, elevate (RICE 🍚😉) and use heat when the inflammation starts to subside (I'm not a pro but I have always done this when I'm injured and it helps a lot) ️⃣ Try other forms of movement that don't aggravate your injury if you want to keep doing something, BUT. A period of rest first is always needed I think. I took a week off entirely after the marathon because my body needed it - guys I couldn't walk essentially ok 😂
-
When I do get back to running, and maybe with Bali and Java 😏🐾 , my body will feel so well rested and it will make it feel better than ever!! Breaks are a GOOD THING, especially for your body physically, and as I said I'm loving strength work at the moment!
-
I'm considering getting some heavier weights, so if you'd be interested in coming along that journey with me then let me know 😉 I really want to be able to do a proper push-up and pull-ups, so maybe I'll set myself some new fun goals and see where it takes me 🤩

Never in a million years did I think I'd be running this race as my first ever endurance event. I was born in London, spent my childhood in the city, and I've been running ever since Dad took me out on a tragic evening jog (there abouts 😅) years ago. Being part of the London Marathon for  genuinely means so much to me 🙈🥺
-
Alongside raising money for Murdered Abroad, I have been working with @newbalance x @sportsshoes who are following the marathon journey of myself and two other runners - the “power women” trio eyyyy 😏 I originally thought I'd sign-up for a marathon in  during my gap year, but as we all know far too well, the world has been stuck in lockdown for quite some time. After a year of races therefore being cancelled and big unknowns, this campaign aims to document our physical and mental journeys before, during and after the big race itself, and has also brought us together to reflect on why we run.
-
Personally, I feel like my running has come a long way over these past few months of training. I've now conquered my longest distance that I'll do before the race (km which I filmed in my last marathon training vlog). I've worked out how to eat and drink whilst running, big win 💪🏻 And most importantly, I'm still smiling even when my legs no longer feel part of my body anymore! 😂 Training has been tough, yes. But I always said to myself, from day one, that this was something I *had* to enjoy . . . And I can safely say I am LOVING IT 🤩

 having these babies for the last  years has taught me so much about myself, life, and others. taking care of two medically frail little honeybears, and having to take the time every day to handfeed luna for the last year or so has been extremely mentally challenging - especially so when my cat developed the brain tumor and i was tending to all of them at once. seeing the creatures i love like this has really made me appreciate health, and the little moments.  
 i never realized how my eating disorder affected the people around me when i was in the midst of it, but now that i've had to take care of an anorexic ferret - i see for the first time. i see how heartbreaking it is for family to see the person they love - unable to take care of themselves, or being too weak to have the will to live. i've felt the heartbreak, i've suffered from the grief of the unknown, i've REALLY come to terms with mortality, and most of all - i've mastered the art of being present.

Doc ID: 24731, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I've gotta ask, why is being a sugar baby meetings with this man in private seem endless. you agreed to  hour sessions but he always keeps you over for at least . you're shaking with anxiety from the minute you step foot in his house. your friends have your location but realistically if something happens, they cant prevent it. your mind wanders to the boy your heart actually belongs to. you mentally over-exert yourself trying to keep up with this old man, perpetually executing this sugar persona that you've curated - a perfected version of yourself that you dont even believe in. you touch upon topics you must put much thought into before speaking upon. you eat, you drink, you get offered a massage. before you know it you're being fingered and finding yourself moaning not for pleasure but for special effect. you feel disgusted with yourself but you only have an hour to go and you need that fuckin' money. afterwards you must continue conversation as normal, as if nothing is wrong and you totally arent distraught by the fact that you just let a  yo man invade you. now imagine you agree to have sex with him. he doesnt tell you that he has herpes until after the fornication has commenced. you never even thought to ask because he was an AIDS doctor with his own practice of many years. he tells you that the herpes is dormant and non-transferrable on the medication he takes, he tells you his ex wife never got it. you spend the rest of your youthful years panicking every time you get razor burn - too afraid to ever tell the boy you love about your fears and anxieties. sugaring can be shit but camming is a different shit beast. the market is oversaturated and chances are your room will only be populated with broke dudes and trolls. if you want to make any money you have to be on for hours at a time, consistently, multiple days a week. everything will be recorded and archived. youll show up on anonib/reddit. people will dox you and find your real name. people will start revenge threads and blackmail you. you spend the rest of your youthful years constantly worried in public that somebodys seen you on the internet.

 learn how to cam / sugar. if its do or die you put that mask on and you make what you gotta work, work.  
 learn to flip drugs. extremely easy profits. only requires one good connection whos willing to front you. and of course multiple smaller connections on the buyers end. you went to public school, didnt you? theres your clientele. doesnt even matter if they liked or like you. theres always a demand.  
 exchange a talent for cash instead of just plain whining about your life for it. can you draw portraits of people? can you offer to write papers, or do homework, or take on chores in exchange for cash? can you do ANYTHING at all? if you have the resources and capability to get word out to ask strangers for $$ ur def capable of getting an advertisement out with the same damn plea on it for exposure.  
 collect &take back pop cans and bottles 
 coinstar if ur lazy or change rolls if u have time to go to a bank. which u should have. if ur unemployed u have time.  
 start babysitting or petsitting. use a website or put up signs.  
 shipt or doordash if you have the means.  
 
 like its literaly so easy to make yourself useful. i know what its like to feel broke and helpless. but you never are. you can always go do something about it. even if its little.  instead of just publicly voicing ur entitlement to other peoples money and doing nothing SMH

Doc ID: 11397, distribution: 1.0 ; Whilst my hair may be a frizzy mess in this photo, it will be something that is forever very special to me. It was taken on one of my last days at home before I moved back to uni, and it will be the last picture I took with Star. 
Sitting here right now, crying whilst writing this, I cannot even begin to explain to you how hard these last two days have been. Following my exam on Friday I got the news that Star had very quickly become seriously ill, and she passed away that afternoon. 
Having only just turned  years old the other day, this has been such a huge shock to not just myself, but everyone else at home. It is crazy how suddenly life can just take a turn, and it is going to take a while to make sense of it all. 
If you have pets or have been an owner in the past, you will know that they are so much more than just animals with names that we feed, take on walks and care for. They become a huge part of your life, and this is something we only truly appreciate when they are lost. 
Going home in a fews weeks time and not being greeted by her tail wagging at the front door, or being able to take her out on morning walks each day is going to be so hard. I am thankful she is no longer in pain, but I wish I could have seen her face for one last time. I wish I could have at least said goodbye.
I love you Star more than than words can describe. You will never, ever, be forgotten ⭐️

 well not a lb lol i was an oz short so  whole ass oZ 
 decided i dont want or need a dayjob this morning LMAO i got priorities. wont catch me working for no more ole boys or chaldo fools because someone tipped me off that thats the situation i was about to walk right back into and it aint worth my gas or time 
 why would i do that when i literally just made .+k in  minutes. it cant be reasoned.  
 
 im bout to renew my late ass $ car tabs, take my ferrets to the vet so i can get luna more prednisone for her low glucose, and get stella xrayed for her weird persistent cough that she only does x a night… bout to make a bunch of phone calls to my car company bank etc get my current custo service nightmare sorted. bout to ship a package. bout to thin my plants and clean my ballasts. bout to walk barefoot in the grass bc sweet relief. money is definitely my # stressor and when money is ok, im okay. as long as i have enough to get by comfortably and know i can make more, im fine. at this rate i can even start saving lol. ive been putting in the work for months and months and this is first real time im reaping any bulk results. complete game changer.  
 everything happens for reasons mans i dont understand it or know why but life is always aligning for me at the very very very last seconds in every circumstance and scenario… just gotta trust the process i guess. its so gratifying to finally have big results. here i was pattin myself on the back for finding a new employer but ironically enough ive come to the conclusion (of course the day im expected to come in for training… always last minute) that i can finally get away with employing myself for the time being instead w/ no worries.. makes me wanna cry lol. i was gonna go in just to be professional but if i go for a day im going to have to go for a whole week or two to collect a paycheck and i already know i dont want to do a week or two so im just gonna disappear n hope they forget about me. i just reconnected with one of the og's of all things blackmarket out here who basically knows everyone worth knowing n already got recommendations (aka guaranteed hire) to better dispensaries if i decide thats what i wanna do.  feels weird af to even have these options lol. im gonna eat some fruit, smoke a hash joint, go lay in the sun n then shower. my girlfriends, all two of them, have been petty passive patties to me lately but thats okay im literally not even worried about them bc i can now occupy myself with all the plots and plans i have now that im in a financially breathable spot and can plot and plan. i blocked my copycat friend up and down, and evryone she knows, (or so i thought) and it literally took her less than  hrs to notice, figure it out, and text me. i found the weasle and blocked her too LOL. my other remaining friend has  interest in my life and only her own so i dont blame her ima just return the favor

Doc ID: 24732, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Forgive me if this comes off badly but lately everytime you mention your bf it's been in a negative light. I get that breaking up or leaving isnt always an option especially since I don't expect you to give the internet every detail of your relationship, but have you. fixing my car himself the  times it's been hit in the last year, helping me save money, helping me start an online business, helping with my grow & all the plants every other day when hes in the same state as me.  He's extremely neurotypical and I'm not so learning how to work together as a team can be challenging because we both have a lot of room to grow and we're very different - but we have a special bond and we're both very similar and committed to one another. The relationship has an added layer of difficulty because he does move back and forth between here and Cali so oftentimes we go months apart which can be challenging but even from k miles away if I really need his help, I have it. I dont think I deserve to be falsely broken up with repeatedly but his immature ass doesnt mean what he says and for some reason still wants to try to make this work so like anyone comitted to their DBS affliction, I'm gonna ride this one out and see where it goes. The last few days our communication has been better/more open so I'm really hoping that the mutual respect he claims to have for me becomes apparent. I really appreciate you being so gently concerned for my wellbeing and happiness. All the past relationships I've been in have been blatantly lacking and abusive and this is the first one I've been in that hasnt been entirely lacking and abusive so its hard for me to gauge when its time to give up.

  theres a lot of pros and cons and they all balance each other out. we dont have adequate time and facilities to eat good and that really bothers me because ive barely been eating on the three shifts ive put in but whatever i guess. and theres only  bathrooms, one for employees and one for customers which is bothersome.. but this is what i got right now. working with weed is like second nature so i wont bother complaining about the hypocrisy that management is already displaying rn.. &  im just too damn tired. its friday and i have an open weekend to do whatwver i want. i cleaned my ferret's cage and i let them run around until they passed out and i spent some money on a good dinner today to treat myself - i had a veg beyond burger doordash'd to me. my delivery driver was cool so i gave her a joint lol i hope shes enjoying it rn. im plopped rn but i still have to take a shower, pull a load of laundry out of the dryer, and put in some work in the garden. i just wanna sleep bc i only got like  hours last night but hey we out here making life work despite the world falling apart n all that fuck

Doc ID: 24296, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: (just for weed btw lol im not into doing hard drugs)  Answer: oh what a relief i wanted to smack u. honestly, you wont find a dealer. they just kinda appear in ur life. dont trust anyone on the internet, the deep web has been gettin hit hard lately by the feds and all reliable marketplaces r down. instagram is pretty sketchy but a LOT of ppl do business on there and ive already met a couple girls on there who for some reason trust me enough to ship to them. i wouldnt advise trusting ppl like that tho bc … not everyone is me. most dealers dont have ya best interest in mine yano lol. if you live in an illegal state your best bet is to just go out in public and meet people and keep nonchalantly bringing up that u need a smoke until u find someone who has it or can help u get it. bars and pubs n clubs are okay, but like the kind of socializing is agonizing to me these days. try maybe an arcade, or like even a hockey rink if theres one by u. just show up, get a drink from the cafeteria. watch practices. eventually SOME boy will approach u and from my experience theres gonna be at least one guy on the team with weed so if ur committed - u can find him lol. shit u cld go to the library n meet someone who smokes weed. or get one of those friendship apps, make some new friends on there - swipe all the ones with “ friendly” in their bios lmao. id offer to ship to u but ur asking anon and idk where u live but yeah ur not gonna ever find anyone reliable lol. dealers r a different breed and since this has become my full time income i can really see why they get so unreliable and wacked out the way they do sometimes bc its an overwhelming business. i wouldnt ever expect a dealer to be reliable just assume they wont be. if u find someone reliable dont lettem go lol.

 anyhow… met some new interesting people. one of which is an award winning grower … holy smokes LITERALLY best pot ive smoked in my life ever AND i got this ole man to follow me back on ig. this guy was like  years old and i got a crush on him after spending  min talking to him fml:(. i feel like im never gonna find a dude whos mature so ima just save my crushes for ppl my parent's age i guess.  
 and thats all ill ever have is crushes bc i still got the ole ball n chain comin home from cali next month 
 honestly im relieved to just have a familiar face back around and assholery that i know how to predict n deal with. i cant handle foreign assholery, it throws me off because i dont know where it stems from or when its gonna happen so i can avoid it 🙄 glad i didnt decide to throw my relationship out the window for some pathetic cheapshot lol. i guess i cant call him cheap, he did buy my ticket tonight and drinks and gave me some weed n wax n donated $ to this pretty vendor girl's beauty table so she gave me a free facial cleanser and lip balm in exchange :') 
 i guess tonight was good because i met some pretty and nice girls but man do i get crowd anxiety at concerts now to the point where i cant even move let alone sway let alone dance even though i know how lmao :') i feel really shitty being called out on it by this dude. im dwelling on it. its like bro i never know when my ex is gonna appear and punch me in the back of the head ITS HAPPENED BEFORE AT A CONCERT SO U NEVER FUCKINF KNOW WITJ MY LUCK pls just give me a break im trying so hard to be normal and sociable and relaxed.   its not nice to keep ditching n distancing urself from someone in public who has social anxiety just bc they “look weird for not dancing” but i cant expect ppl who dont mean shit to me and arent close to me to accomodate my trauma n mental issues. ugh. whatever ive embarrassed myself way harder in front of this pos and he still wants to have sex with me so i dont know why im beating myself up over this.  
 ima stay focused on the nice interactions i had with approx  men and  women. thank god women exist. theyre so intuitive and forgiving they can like sense and soothe my anxious soul, literally the girls i met tonight are what helped me keep it together.

 i just texted him to not even bother today bc i want to spare myself the disappointment while im ahead. im turning my alarms off and im gonna lay down and shut my eyes and turn off my phone and try not to cry myself into asphyxiation like i always do. if i sleep now i can get like  hours before i have to get up and move about and tackle school.  
 ive barely been eating lately because im so overwhelmed and its so hard to prepare yourself nice food for not a lot of money when you live in the arctic tundra and ur stuck at a college all day with student facilities that are under construction and a broken ass car with no heat. i feel so stupid. i cant save money. i cant take care of myself. i cant maintain peace for more than  minutes. as soon as my animals die im not gonna have a fucking purpose anymore. im not even gonna be able to think straight or rest at all. i cant stop worrying and anticipating. times like this when u wish u had a mom or someone to tell u everythings gonna be ok. ive always sucked at comforting myself. my natural reflex to emotional pain is self destruction, not self soothing. i dont even know what to do. the oscillating catatonic panic attacks and the detached depersonalized episodes have been alternating so frequently that im even neglecting to go to the bathroom as often as i should. i almost pissed myself yesterday morning and i actually did piss myself today. i dont know why i try to fight my bodys cues. i dont know why i can take care of everyone and everything else but not myself.  
 i had a brief moment of hope there and now i just. i just need to shut my eyes

As more than just furry companions living under the same roof, to me pets are family and a huge part of my life. And living with animals truly brings out the best in me. They bring positivity to my down days and make the best ones even better. They'll listen when there's no-one else to have a 'proper' human conversation with and sit next to me (or on me) when I'm channeling my inner yogi. They make me laugh, make me smile, and at times like this they'll surely make me cry.

Even though the patch of grey and white fur on my bed was all he left behind, I will never let go of all the incredibly special memories spent together over the past  years. They say cats have  lives and I know Berlioz lived his to the fullest, and the least I can do is thank him for being the most incredible tabby cat I'll ever know.

 also scrubbed my ferret's cage clean. and cancelled my car insurance before they charged me on the th of next month :') and paid my bills and and got groceries and am on top of my debts. feelin accomplished and good physically. i hve to go to the community college tomorrow and see a counselor about signing up for fall semester. ive been going to bed at like /am routinely and i want to be at the office when they open at am so i dont know how tonight is about to pan out. gonna shower all the dirt and sweat and shit away and try to fall asleep but ill probably be wired awake working because i have cured plants sitting in my room that need to be trimmed and thats kinda time sensitive.  
 i just wanna be well rested for tomorrow so i can get that shit over with. i have a lot to trim before friday, and this girl i met on facebook circa  is gonna drive a state up and come pick me up so we can go to this art exhibition downtown together - im rly excited to meet her she's always been sweet to me.  
 i need to have this fuckening house and my life presentable before she gets here… but if i keep this momentum ill be fine. i just hope my dad isnt a jerk and fuckin ruins anything. i had a new girlfriend over the other day and i gave him a heads up and asked him not to embarass me and he screamed at me and told me to get out of my face. thank god girls are so forgiving. i came outside to greet her with tears and she was immediately sympathetic and asked if i needed to leave. showed up with smirnoff ice's n everything…. idk why im overthinking this i just dont want anyone to feel uncomfortable at my house because im uncomfortable / …. :') 
 its nice to have some people back in my life that arent men tryna power trip over me or play games with me. speaking of which my ¿ex?boyfriend is flying back in on sunday… and he is assuming that everything is fine with us, and is expecting that im picking him up from the airport even though a lot of hurtful amd toxic stuff has been said and done on both of our parts that i still havent rly gotten any closure on. but oh well. my dumb ass is just happy to see him. i have a lot of physical labor bullshit thats been piling up in my garden and i need some fuckin' help and we have a lot of eachother's possessions still so we were going to hve to see one another anyways. im just hoping it goes smooth because last time i picked him up from the airport was probably my # worst day out of the last  months.. and we both almost died.

Doc ID: 24525, distribution: 1.0 ; i need ur help it takes  seconds
 
 so im entering a contest to try and win free tickets to go see flume (my favorite artist who's music has kept me alive since high school) in colorado this summer and this is gonna be a REALLY longwinded post but ill put the link here and if you “pre register” this little form for me aka enter a phone number and email for me, i get  points which helps my odds.  
 if you have more than five seconds, continue reading and i will elaborate on why this means so so much to me: tw abuse i wont go into detail but yeah 
 this would be the second time i'd be seeing him at red rocks. unfortunately my first journey across the united states to colorado was terrible. this was a few years ago, in / ish. i drove with my abusive ex, about  hours. he sexually/physically/mentally/chemically abused me the entire time we were there. the majority of the trip was spent in a hotel room, giving him sex.  
 seeing flume was an amazing life changing experience, hearing this extremely special music in front of a backdrop that's too beautiful for words. i even got to meet one of my internet friends for the first time at this show, she's a living breathing angel. this was supposed to be a good trip, but unfortunately i couldnt enjoy it to the fullest because of my ex. 
 im gonna try and explain this the best i can, sorry if its not cohesive. my ex convinced me to take cocaine for like the second time in my life at this concert, it wasnt my idea but he insisted. i could've been content stopping after my first time… cocaine and i do NOT mix but at the time i didnt know this so i just took it, i didnt see or predict the long term harm it would cause when i turned into an addict/abuser months later. to make matters worse, my ex bought it off a random wook who was lurking the parking lot before the event. so imagine this concert - im “coked” up on miscellaneous powder, and im doing my flow art. 

i “glove” for fun, its basically hand dancing but with LED lights attached to your fingertips with white gloves, depending on how you move your hands and fingers you can make shapes and patterns with the lights and its cool. its considered a “flow art” and its one of the very few things i enjoy doing. im listening to flume, flowing, feeling FILLED with love, and then all of a sudden my ex turns to me and says “can you stop doing that” so he could hold me / grope me to the music instead. 
 word to the wise, if you ever see someone EXTREMELY involved in a task, and they're having fun - dont ever, ever, ever, ever, ever… tell them to stop. unless there's a tsunami coming. that shit is heart breaking. i couldn't bring myself to enjoy the rest of the event or put my gloves back on, i just completely retreated inside of myself. all i could do was stare ahead at the stage and hold my own hands/cross my arms. 
 the night got worse, much much later after we dropped my e-friend back off at her home, we were driving back to the hotel in my vehicle. my ex started to lose his mind and was blowing red lights. literally would stop for the light, and then would go through it before it ever turned green anyways. i kept asking him what the fuck was wrong with him and to pull over and his only response was “i dont know sorry” and he would just keep going. back at the hotel, he threatened to fly home and leave me alone with my car across the country twice. looking back, i should of let him. 
 the one other time we left the hotel, i wanted to go to pike's peak. pike's peak is a k ish foot mountain. the weather was beginning to get inclement as we drove to the top. i am absolutely terrified of heights (have had recurring nightmares since childhood about driving straight off of mountains) and was crying in the passenger seat the entire time. there are no guard rails in most places driving up to the peak so you can imagine my terror as im letting this beans for brains of a man drive my vehicle , feet up into the air, he cant even tell green apart from red. when we reached the peak it was beginning to hail and thunder but i wanted to get out just to take a single picture to celebrate the fact that i made it… as soon as i got out and took my picture - lightning struck the ground no more than  feet in front of me and i felt it shock my feet, even with rubber soles. we promptly left after that. i kept asking the universe for a sign while i was there, and in that instant it gave it to me. not the sign i was looking for but a powerful sign nonetheless. 
 the rest of the trip was filled with tears and sex that i didn't want to have. an ATM machine ate my debit card in downtown colorado so i didnt have any money on me at this point. we almost didnt have enough money to get home, my ex had to overdraft his account and luckily we had just enough cash to get back. when we embarked on our journey home i was driving for about  hours when i got pulled over in iowa for speeding. my ex had gotten pulled over for speeding on the journey TO colorado but the cop had let us go. this cop wasnt feeling as generous, he illegally connived me out of my car, prolonged the traffic stop, bullied me into sitting in the front seat of his cruiser - and then he interrogated us separately. eventually my ex admitted he had weed in the car. we gave it to the officer. 
 the officer only gave me a possession charge even though the weed belonged to my boyfriend. this cost me $, that i did not have. come to think of it, this is the event that triggered the snowball of financial problems im currently still suffering from. i had to hire a lawyer in iowa so that i didnt have to go back there for my trials, he was the only lawyer who answered my calls. 
 after  and a half hours the cop let us go (on the police report he said i looked “drug sick” but told me to my face that he was only letting me go because “his niece struggles from an eating disorder too”… yeah i used that as an excuse.)  i blacked out from stress and hit my head extremely hard on the windows inside my car. that was the first time i gave myself a concussion. we barely got home in one piece lol. 
 the relationship was over once and for all after that - even though he said he'd help me pay for the charge, he never did. this same ex was stalking me at a festival a month later - , people there and somehow he found me and was following me at one point, aggressively questioning me and my now-boyfriend. then a month later, he attacked me and my now-boyfriend at another concert. i was facing the stage and someone punched me in the back of the head, when i turned around my ex was attempting to grab onto my now-boyfriend. everyone in the vicinity was getting hit and shoved, and it was chaos. my ex ran off before security could come. i now have a restraining order against this person but thats about all i could do. i tried to press charges but the courts messed up the case and dropped his charges. i worked with a detective, i drove an hour downtown multiple times, i showed up to court the first time EARLY, : on the dot, he didnt even show up. the scheduled him a re-trial and told me i didnt have to come next time, so i didnt. and because i didnt show up, they dropped his case. 
 super long story short i really want to go back to red rocks because since the last time i went there, my life has been nothing but trauma after trauma. i dont really have the money at all to buy show tickets and plane tickets but i will probably buy them anyways at some point and end up going alone if i have to. i have nothing else to look forward to in life and this man's music has single-handedly kept me sane and on this earth since  and i really want nothing more than to just feel reconnected with him again. this will be his only show in north america this year. 
 right now all my money needs to be going into fixing my truck that i have to turn back in, in july. flume will be at red rocks in august. if i can pull my life together and get this car returned with no problems by july, i'm going to quit my day job (which has had me extremely suicidal for months and months now) and i'm going to enjoy being car-less for a month or a few until i can save up for a new one. i will subsist on my garden money and maybe i will go back to college. maybe i will move out of the state. i dont know. all i know is that a lot of my responsibilities are worries will be alleviated by august. since the last time i went to colorado i've felt cursed since, and i really just want to go back and heal that part of my life that still hurts me a lot. i dont know. its a beautiful state and i'd like to try and make peace with it and myself. and i miss my friend, we're both so much more grown now and i'd like to hang out with her again while i'm not on cocaine/being influenced by a looming man thats dulling my shine. 
 if you've made it reading this far i love you and im sorry for making you bare witness to my weird painful stories but it would really mean the world to me if you could click the link i listed and enter your info - or any info. if i won these tickets it would be an absolute miracle and would really help make up for the past few years that i've been scraping through.

Doc ID: 24445, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: im sorry if im overstepping, but with all the posts you make mentioning your boyfriend it doesn't seem like it's a very good relationship :( i could be wrong of course but im just wondering why you stay with him, he seems kind of toxic Answer: ur no oversteppin. thats fair lol, i try not to post abt him too much. we can both be toxic. he claims to have plans for my bday now, “ its just a surprise” so perhap im being dramatic but i.. do get put on the backburner a lot bc his music career is about to pop off. hes leaving  days after my bday bc his music is bein played at edc and hes not even released yet so going means everything to him bc his career is everything to him hes extremely passionate and motivated abt music and its why i love him and its also why im sad n bein backburned all the time lol. its conflicting but like we make sacrifices. i admire him for having dreams bc all of mine died a long time ago. our relationship is ahhhh very complex but were learning as we go. he shows his love in different ways than i do and we're polar opposites but its worth it for right now because ultimately we do help eachother grow and no relationship comes without struggle and sacrifice, ours is just kinda amplified because his career isnt conventional and its hard for me to come to terms with but hopefully in the long run itll pay off. i could blab all day about all the shit he does and has done to help me, it just seems a bit sappy. my bday just depresses me blah sorry
