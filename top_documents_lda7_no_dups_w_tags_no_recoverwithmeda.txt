Doc ID: 1865, distribution: 0.9979940383662456 ; I have a history of using the gym for evil and really overdoing it. How I am right now after avoiding the gym for so long, is very out of shape and weak and pathetic. Muscles? Who's she. Stamina? Don't know her. Physical health?? make it make sense. cont. under read more:Anyways with this self isolation thing going on part of me wants to help myself get in better shape, I mean my lb dog makes my arms give out. when I say im out of shape, i mean my muscles are threads and going up  steps leaves me winded. Im not talking about ‚Äúsummer body toned‚Äù i mean literally i have like no strength at all my muscles are just paper. I cant even stand in the kitchen to cook without needing to sit down before I pass out. But how do I get healthy when I cant even control myself in exercise mode? Theres such a thin line between ‚Äúim doing the correct amount and thats perfectly fine‚Äù and ‚Äúwork out until all i see is white and I wake up on the floor‚ÄùI just want to be normal. I want to have normal strength. Normal stamina. I want my body to be human. Instead Im a soggy tissue and trying to better myself only ends in the eating disorder taking over. I feel that way about ever attempt to better myself.. work out? Ed ruins it. Eat healthy? Ed ruins it. Eat more? Ed ruins it. Eat less? Ed ruins it. Drink more water? Ed ruins it. Every time I try to just be normal, Ed pushes it to the extreme in any direction and ruins it.I look normal. talking about it with people isnt really helpful. No one believes me and they always try to convince me that im lying. They overestimate my abilities just because of how i look. bro theres no muscle under my skin its just fat. take a squeeze lmao not even lying. I wish I could change it. I used to play sports wtf..Ive been trying to do At Home work outs I hate it. Ive always hated exercising. I only did it for hours to punish myself. It has never been enjoyable. And at home Im struggling to get anything going, because i hate it so much but i also am afraid if I give effort im going to overdo it like always. There's no balance. Its shitty no matter what I do so I tend to get ultra depressed and avoid it. bringing me back here, complaining I cant do anything right and help myself. I feel like I wont live that long unless I get my act together and get healthier. but hOooOwwWW.

Doc ID: 1312, distribution: 0.9979854926451656 ; soakedbrain:imtrying-butimpissed:The super shitty thing about eating disorders, especially the restrictive types, is that when you are deep enough in it, youre proud of your suffering because that becomes the only thing youre good at. What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer. And think youre winning in life That is a VERY frightening place to be in and even harder place to crawl out of. A very sad, tiny little world to be in. Triggers in recovery are normal as fuck. I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of iti remember scrolling down the ed recovery tag back in december, when my relapse was getting worse by the day, but i could still say at least i wasnt depressed, i hadnt lost my will to live, then, though i knew it was only a matter of time - a couple of weeks at most. this post hit close to home back then. this fucked up sense of achievement was always transient and it felt ever more unsubstantial the deeper i fell into my ed, but i could never let the memory of it go. soon enough everything felt so much more hellish and miserable, and i was dragging everyone down that dark, hopeless road to nowhere with me because anorexia had completely taken over my life. eventually i wished i would die because i didnt know how else i could make it all stop.ive been in recovery again for the past week. i couldnt exactly remember what was written in this post but i felt the need to look for it again a few days ago, and ive found it worded one of the biggest reasons why ive committed to recovery and why its been worth all the hardships in a very piercing way.thank you for this. i know ill keep coming back to this post. 
I adore you and will be here for you in your recovery journey.

Doc ID: 7878, distribution: 0.9976903020355741 ; we're a culture built on fabricated lies. on ignorance.
.
we like to forget the things weight is good for. we pretend we always ‚Äúneed‚Äù to lose it. an unspoken rule says weight loss is a valuable use of time. when did boasting you're on a diet become so admirable?
.
by default, weight gain is the opposite. isn't it running into the fire? counterintuitive? .
this was my toxic headspace at , staring death in the face. my eating disorder had led me to lose over half my body weight. time was running out. the aching ice in my bones. the grey paper skin that draped over them. none of it was sustainable. i would die without restoring the weight. .
.
what scared me the most was that i slaved away for years just to reverse my, uh, ‚Äúhard work‚Äù. this taunted me. how was i supposed to gain weight, when i had come to know weight loss as the feat of all feats?
.
weight restoration is hard. i took it on in the midst of summer. it was laced with beach trips and ice cream outings and pain and crippling anxiety. everyone was dangling a ‚Äúbikini body‚Äù in my face, the same face i was stuffing with , calories a day.
.
at first i felt...failure. my body was changing fast and i felt it wouldn't stop. how badly i wanted to quit. but then it started happening.
.
the light. ‚ú®
.
when the weight began to come back on, life shifted to color. once my body was no longer guessing if it'd be nourished that day, once love became consistent, dependable, it‚Ä¶worked. my body started to work. i was no longer ice cold in july. my skin was pinking up. my eyes were no longer empty black holes. standing wasn't taxing, but effortless. i could finally go for walks with my mom. finally.
.
we like to forget the things weight is good for. how having enough of it allows us to exist so that we can live. when it feels like the world is screaming to get rid of it all, stay mindful. what will serve YOU? seeing my body change, surrendering control, it felt weak. but when i started to see the life i led with MORE weight, i was captivated. what my body looked like meant nothing compared to health. if this is what my body looks like for me to live, so be it.

Doc ID: 7855, distribution: 0.9975336983527209 ; one of the most frustrating elements of mental illnesses is that they're so‚Ä¶invisible.
.
eating disorders live in the mind. physical manifestations are secondary to the root cause. .
.
it's a head game. your mind is a control system that's been hijacked, and the body responds to all commands. it knows they're wrong, but it's deeper than that. the hardwiring has been targeted and setting that straight is anything but a linear process.
.
so when i finally began recovering, nobody could tell.
.
my recovery was slow. i saw the changes i made as drastic. on the outside, the -foot hurdles i was throwing myself over were nothing more than bumps in the road.
.
its HARD to face demons when only you can see them. my family was my greatest support system. but they couldn't understand the paranoia.
.
recovering from a mental illness is like being alone in a crowded room. nobody can push you to face your monsters. nobody can see them. they don't make sense to anyone else. my disorder led me to fear things i knew were irrational but suffocated me anyway. .

sleeping through the night without sneaking a workout. using mugs without washing them x, in case a granule of sugar lingered from the last use. sitting in the high school cafe instead of a bathroom stall, even though i was convinced being NEAR a bagel would cause weight gain.
.
nobody said to me, ‚Äúgood job using a mug today‚Äù because nobody knew that specific fear was even an issue. i relapsed over and over. why? i waited for someone to see the problems i needed to fix in order to justify me fixing them. when i finally accepted that seeking external praise was crippling me (and that it wasn't coming!), i was able to save my own life.
.
in a culture that's conditioned to look outwardly to gauge success, facing invisible fears feels like a waste. i was discouraged to keep facing small fears because nobody was noticing.
.
i've learned that you have to carry yourself. because while your struggles feel invisible to everyone else, they're not to you. you can see them...so face them. .
.
as my mom always says , ‚Äúonly you can help yourself‚Äù. so do it. they'll notice one day. .
.
but that's not really important anyway, right?

Doc ID: 7573, distribution: 0.9975207676939958 ; growing up i had an eating disorder. it lived as a voice in my head. it convinced me of wild, disgustingly unhealthy beliefs. it created rules i couldn't break. it sheltered me, hid me from the world, shrunk me until i lost myself in thin air.
.
.
healing came through exposure. by testing feared waters. by simply doing the damn thing and seeing firsthand that the world wouldn't come crashing down. go up in flames.
.
.
how everything would be...fine. .
.
i was deathly afraid of most foods. of eating before a certain amount of hours passed between meals. of eating without working out that day. of not working out twice a day. the fears i held prevented me from leading a normal life. i was incapable of going with the flow or listening to my body. living in the real world threatened my disorder, so i chose not to.
.
.
but i was seventeen when i began recovering. i had an entire life ahead of me and college around the corner. i couldn't cling to these ways and expect to live a fulfilled life. .
.
i had to rebel against every last rule.
.
.
i ate the foods my disorder swore would ruin my life. i ate between meals when my stomach grumbled, not when the clock struck the perfect hour. i ate regardless of physical activity done for the day. i stopped doubling up on workouts. then i stopped working out altogether, for some time. .
.
exposure therapy is the only way to heal. how else do you expect to realize that the things you fear are irrational? you need to experience it directly. you need to walk into the fire you crafted in your head and walk out unburned, unscathed, just to realize that there simply isn't a fire at all. .
.
today, i engage in behaviors that used to be toxic fears. i now eat foods that once terrified me without thinking twice. i now work out to feel good and grow stronger, not to burn every morsel that enters my body. liberation washes over me as i nourish myself with the things that once brought me the greatest pain. .
.
this is healing. this is trying. this is what happens when you stop feeling sorry for yourself and pick yourself off, dust yourself off, and really kick this thing to the ground.
.
.
just try your best. your best will get better.

Doc ID: 7655, distribution: 0.9975207676939958 ; positive self-talk saved my life.
.
i fell in love with words at a young age. i've always known that a perfect pairing provides comfort. carries weight. can heal.
.
when i was recovering from my eating disorder i was uncomfortable. nobody warned me about how scared i'd feel in my growing frame. how hard it'd be to see my body change and my clothes shrink. my skin felt tight as i expanded, forcing me to relearn what it meant to be whole. making this house a home was the greatest challenge.
.
i wanted to quit daily. weight was just sitting on my stomach and i was breaking out and having hot flashes and for some reason i was always hungry after a heavy meal? i didn't understand. i felt like i was doing recovery all wrong. maybe i should quit.
.
in these moments of doubt i would call on positive self-talk. on words.
.
i was the girl whose bedroom was covered in posters of affirmations. who coated mirrors in post-it notes with uplifting reminders.
.
i spoke to myself kindly during my recovery. one phrase guided my heart: ‚Äúall discomfort is temporary‚Äù. i repeated this to myself when my jeans felt snug or when my hunger cues felt off or when i swore the weight would never redistribute. i repeated this to myself when eating felt like death or when my sister would come home from a run all sweaty and sore, and i would watch with envy, having not exercised in months. .
.
recovery is hard until it's not. you can't give up because it's uncomfortable. if it's uncomfortable, it's working. .
.
.
i handled myself with care because i was fragile. that's okay. that's fair. i put every last ounce of trust behind words of hope. i healed by way of forgiveness, toward myself, for my fears and anxiety and for hurting myself in the first place. .
.
.
i share affirmations on my stories because i know the power they have over our hearts, our minds. i hope they reach those who need them. i know i did. i still do.
.
fill your headspace with hope and trust and be willing to endure the pain. sometimes all we need is a fleeting reminder, one that comes at the exact time we need it. .
.
remember that all discomfort is temporary. push through, because temporary isn't forever. you got this. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Doc ID: 7905, distribution: 0.9975077007314375 ; at  years old, i had to relearn nearly everything i knew about being human.
.
my eating disorder had turned me into a zombie, a machine. it drained me like a parasite. it stripped me of every last touch of life. i was empty, always empty. .
so when i finally began a true recovery, i had to leave this behind.
.
i had to relearn the simple things. how to walk across a room without growing lightheaded. how to climb stairs without taking a break to sit after each ascent upward. how to sit in a chair without my tailbone screaming with agony.
.
i had to relearn the things that human beings naturally seek out for their well-being. how to eat without a demon in my ear insisting i would self-combust for doing so. how to stay put when an anxiety attack whirled inside my stomach. why? because my sisters got to go for runs and my teammates got to go to practice and me? i wasn't allowed to exercise for months.
.
i had to relearn the things that take you from existing to living. how to laugh again. how to accept an invitation for a meal out, one i couldn't control, in order to mend broken relationships. how to follow my heart instead of my hyper-structured schedule. how to say yes, yes, yes to everything my eating disorder would have never allowed.
.
i had to relearn how to be selfless. how to heal myself so those who loved me could sleep at night. how to accept my body for how it looked and what it could do because it deserved better than a voice in my head. how to skip the gym, have a second lunch, embrace schedule changes in order to accommodate others in my life.
.
and i'm still learning. i'm learning how to love, how to receive love. how to accept. accept the life i've been given, the body i have, the way i look. how to be kind, how to stay stronger than the fleeting whispers of a disordered behavior from lifetimes ago. how to keep going when it feels crippling to do so.
.
recovery from an eating disorder is a lifelong pursuit, an intimate and emotional endeavor to find peace in your own heart. it is hard, it is taxing‚Ä¶but it is stabilizing, it is rewarding. it is the most humbling challenge i will ever take on, and for that i'm deeply grateful.

So why bother. Literally. Why bother with the constant suffering if it changes nothing about how you feel. Eat. Eating fuels your brain. It fuels your cells to do their cellular job. If youre trying to survive on nothing you will feel like trash emotionally and physically. Why are you so fucking depressed??? Cuz your brain cant take the bullshit. Any brain surviving on XXX will % be a very upset brain. You cant Happy yourself out of that. You dont have the energy to do that. Fucking eat. The biggest hurdle but the most important step to recovery, is letting go of a sick body. You NEED to gain, you need to let go of controlling your body. A healthy body is nourished. A healthy brain doesnt obsess over sizes and numbers. Its not that simple yes it is. Eat. Force your Ed to shut the fuck up. Cry if you need. Scream if you need. But just fucking eat. Your emotional well being, physical wellbeing, and mental health will all improve as you begin actually feeding your brain and body. Duh. Fucking duh. I absolutely see where you're coming from, and being where you're supposed to be physically works wonders on your mind - but in order to really let go of a sick body, you'll need more than just nutritional restoration. I knew I had to eat enough to keep my body alive for years, but the lack of resources for my mindset just invalidated the hell out of me and kept me sicker. You can't recover without taking care of the physical aspect first, but that can only go so far without needing mental help to cope with all of that.If I'm taking your post too literally, I apologize.
I definitely think getting therapy cannot be ignored in recovery. Absolutely people need mental help to get better. Its the physical part a lot of people tend to slack on. Just therapy isnt enough. You cant heal unless you work on both your brain and your body.

Doc ID: 9476, distribution: 0.997467660122556 ; wanna know what breaks my heart? the amount of brides-to-be that get preyed on by diet culture making them think that they ‚Äúshould‚Äù sign up for ‚Äúbridal bootcamps‚Äù and ‚Äúneed‚Äù to lose weight or change their body so that they can look their ‚Äúbest‚Äù on their wedding day.

i'm not anti-weight loss or anti-people who want to change how they look, but i am anti-putting value in people's bodies and anti-the systems that oppress those that don't meet diet culture's standards for health and beauty.

if you want to lose weight for your ‚Äúbig day‚Äù or some other occasion, i'm not here to tear you down, but here are some reasons why it might be in your best interest to NOT try to lose weight for your wedding or any other special event:

- you might struggle to be present on the day of your event
- it could ruin the day of your event if you aren't at your goal weight
- you might not have the energy you want leading up to and on the day of your event
- the way you view and treat your body might affect the way the people around you view and treat their own
- it might make you miss out on fun experiences
- if you make your weight a top priority leading up to the event, then your weight will likely stay as a top priority after
- it could be detrimental to both your physical and mental health long-term.
- it might affect your relationship with your loved ones
- your memories of the day could be tainted

is the potential end goal of weight loss (which doesn't change your worth one bit) for one day (which you might not fully enjoy if you pursue that weight loss) really worth all of those likely consequences??

you are not a bad person if you want to lose weight, but the society that we live in that worships thinness is oppressive, makes a lot of people feel bad for NOT losing weight, and puts so much value in our bodies which really have nothing to do with our worth.

NO ONE deserves to feel morally obligated to change  their body or appearance for any reason, and we are ALL inherently and unconditionally worthy no matter what.

next time you catch yourself shaming yourself or feeling guilty for what you ate, how you look, or how your body is, ask yourself, where did my beliefs about this come from? and learn to reframe your thoughts.

some examples:

‚Äúi can't trust my body because whenever i eat X, i gain weight.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äúi've broken trust with my body by trying to control it, and weight gain is not inherently bad. my body is on my side, and if it changes size by nourishing it with what it's asking for, then it was supposed to change size.‚Äù

‚Äúi have to calorie count because i'm afraid of what eating more than X calories will do to me.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äúcalorie counting keeps me from using internal cues of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction. calories are not the enemy. they don't do something to me, they are energy that do something for me.‚Äù

‚Äúother people eat and workout a certain way, so i'm supposed to eat and workout that way too.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äúthere is no 'right', 'perfect', or superior way to eat or move. that might be for them, but it is not for me.‚Äù

‚Äúmoving my body every day is healthy.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äútaking care of my body every day is healthy. sometimes that means movement, and sometimes that means rest.‚Äù

‚Äúbeing smaller than other people makes
 me better and helps me in life.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äúaccepting my natural body size whatever that may be and honoring what my body needs allows me to focus on living out my purpose which is what will help me live a more fulfilling and joyful life.‚Äù

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - saut√©ed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for  hours
- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
- cup each of diced carrots and celery
- bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
- cups water
- cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don't stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! üòç | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right.

I hope this series of 'what IG sees VS what IG doesn't' photos reminds you why you shouldn't compare yourself to people online! It's not fair on us to compare our natural, normal, everyday selves to the perfected, posed & edited versions of people online... We only see % of someone's life here on IG, so it's unfair to compare our % to someone else's highlighted % ü§Ø

When I first started this series I still worried that someone might see these photos of me and think, ‚ÄúOh, she's not as pretty as I thought‚Äù but then I realised it LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER! That doesn't change or determine who I am, what path I'm on and how I make others feel ‚Äî unless I let it. Being more accepting of yourself is a choice, CHOOSE to be kinder to yourself! ü§™ Anyway... All I hope for is that my Instagram can be a home for you to find comfort, confidence, acceptance, motivation & positivity. So I'll just keep posting these every Monday as a friendly reminder as we enter a new week. I hope yours is amazing! ü•∞

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram ‚Äî swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) ü¶ã 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

üå∏ people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC üå∏

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

‚ù§Ô∏è your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
ü•ô your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? üí™üèº 
ü¶† half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? ü•∫
üß¨ while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .‚Äù, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible ü§Ø

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way üíõ

Welcome to a special Real Me Monday  recap!! Here's my fav RMM photos from across the year to remind you that bodies are ever-changing & to never compare yourself to what you see online or in the media. 

Not only does your body change day-to-day & year-to-year, but also with different lighting, poses, angles or clothing, so it's hardly fair to base your worth or judge yourself on something as fickle & ever-changing as your body.

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of cellulite‚Äù
More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of hip dips‚Äù
The list goes on. [ad]

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. Do you have to LOVE them? No of course not, but these features are human.

Let's approach them one by one‚Ä¶

Belly fat: a layer of fat is vital for a healthy, functioning, fertile body. It's essential that the human body has some, you would not function without it. It serves to absorb vitamins, store energy, protect & insulate your body. 

Loose skin: is due to your skin stretching at some point‚Ä¶ It will likely tighten up again slowly over time depending on how much you have. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's something to be in awe of!

Stretch marks: AKA a beautiful purple/pink scar that shows you how much you've grown. Almost everyone will have stretch marks at least once in their lives as we all go through a growth spurt from child to adult.

Cellulite: more women have cellulite because the structure of our connective tissue is different to men, which causes our skin to dimple where theirs doesn't (as much).

Hip dips: the appearance of hip dips is due to your BONE structure & the shape of your pelvis. If all of us could see our skeletons, we would see an indentation where the hip bone meets the top of the thigh.

(Even those who appear to not have any of them, most likely do!!)

Here's a proud video of mine, along with showing you how easy it can be to ‚Äúhide‚Äù these things online which is why we don't see them very often, but I promise you are definitely not the only one with them üåü

The more we see it, the more we normalise it ü•∞

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.9693593676887979 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those ‚Äúless flattering‚Äù angles.

So often people joke about ‚Äúgirls on Instagram VS girls in real life‚Äù or catfishing in general‚Ä¶ These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look ‚Äúflattering‚Äù & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat üôÑ

The thing is, you don't have to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù all the time‚Ä¶ ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life‚Ä¶ Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone ‚Äúperfect‚Äù & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own‚Ä¶ Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

So we flew into Bangkok and had to quarantine (on the Test & Go scheme) in the city at the very start of our trip. In all honesty, we did very little exploring, Matthew didn't have his luggage, and so our first impressions weren't great üòï We also stayed near Khao San Road, which is a lively backpacker hub, but we just didn't really vibe with it!
-
However, staying in Siam at the very end of our trip *completely* changed our opinion of the capital city. Here are some of our highlights and recommendations:
-
üáπüá≠ Siam is a shopping district so you have loads of shopping malls, souvenir shops and outdoor markets üëåüèª You can pay by card in more places here too to save your cash, and it's also only a  minute drive to the international airport, BKK!

üáπüá≠ If you want a temporary tattoo to prank your parents go to @airydolly üòè It's on the upper floor of a building with a restaurant underneath (it's easy to miss)!
-
üáπüá≠ We stumbled upon the Tropical Fruit Market, which only runs temporarily and has finished now üò≠ But I think it might be an annual thing? I'm not too sure on that one you guys, but it was AMAZINGGGGG nonetheless ü§©

üáπüá≠ To get around definitely use @grabth (basically Uber in Thailand)! You pay by card on the app and you'll pay a set price!

We left Koh Tao, where we did scuba diving with @lbdivingkohtao (episode  on YouTube), and travelled back to Bangkok. Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I'd recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I'd organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map üòÖ)!

Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani üò±üò≥ Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive üòÇ But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today's vlog on YouTube (episode , live @ pm) üòè I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it!

You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN.

This week has so far reminded me that laughter truly is the. best. medicine. Honestly, I laughed until I cried on the evening of my dude's birthday when we did our little family non-pub pub quiz. Without a doubt, the highlight of my lockdown so far. Cats are apparently really 'lucky' when they fall, Elton John's first hit single was 'Baby' and the Great Fire of London was in  (if you've seen the vlog, you know) üòÇ
-
I also laughed this entire morning editing the Q&A Em and I filmed, also on her birthday. Coming @  today (farts and laughter all included) üòâ
-
So here's my reminded to all of you guys reading to have a laugh and almost wet yourself. On the daily. I am generally a very uptight person, and often find it hard to let loose shall we say. But wow, we're high not only on green smoothies right now, but a lot of serotonin and endorphins too. And it feels good üòèüôà
-
To therefore conclude this waffle, go and write yourself a quiz and then L A U G H. Lots.

So this was a very spontaneous decision at the start of my last day in Munich. Did I think anyone would actually come??? . . . absolutely not!!! But honestly, being able to meet you guys in person, and in places not even close to home, makes me so incredibly happy, and it's always the best reminder as to why I share my life online ü•∞

I told you Munich had been the best time (watch out for the vlog today üòéü§ì), and this just made it even better üôà Germany definitely know how to make the best pretzels (ü§§ü§©), and to have seen you guys waiting for me at the station as I sprinted to the hostel and just about made my train to Nuremberg put the biggest smile on my face üòÜ

So a huge huuuuge thank you to every single one of you who came to say hello the other day, and of course to all of you who've clicked follow or subscribe.

It's basically an indoor fairground with on-site food and drinks (lots of good vegan stuff and non-alcoholic drinks as well), and trusttttt me you guys, it's soooo so much fun wow üôåüèª Sara and I did take our games very seriously (and you definitely work up a sweat if you're properly going for it like we were üòÖ), but it's the perfect way to spend time just laughing and having a great time with your friends or family . . . thank me later‚úåüèª

It is very reasonably priced with tickets costing ¬£ per person and you get a slot that lasts  hour  minutes üëåüèª The aesthetics of the venue are also such a cool vibe ü§ì

Let me know if you guys have done it / book to go, and just a heads-up if you are pretty competitive like myself, just make sure you understand the game before you play and you'll do a lot better üòâ

Yes, the journeys were sometimes incredible long, busy, hot, delayed and boring when I ran out of charge and had no plug sockets lol üòÖ . . . but I saw  cities over  weeks and I do seriously think this was my most adventurous travel itinerary yet ü§ì

-
I wanted to make this video because it can seem difficult to be vegan on flights, but I was more than happy with all my food for these  hours flying to Thailand from London üòâ Yes, there's a lot of plastic and other things I can definitely criticise, but I just wanted to simply show that it *is* possible to be vegan on flights!
-
My advice: () Request your specific meals early!!! I cannot emphasise this enough ok, because I was originally told that I'd booked too late and couldn't get vegan meals (only vegetarian) üò¢ I therefore brought a lot of food with me, but I ended up getting two vegan meals on the flight anyway (and had my food too) üôåüèª () Bring more than you think you'll need () Fruit is always a good shout as it's juicy and will help you stay hydrated () Don't be afraid to ask to fill up your water üí¶
-
I obviously haven't had the most extensive experience with being vegan when flying, and whilst this one *could* have been a disaster (üôà), I haven't had a bad experience yet!

vegan vanilla iced pumpkin olive oil loaf

**note: this is the recipe i followed exactly. i baked for about  minutes  and while the outside cooked, the middle/inside stayed quite raw. since these are vegan that's totally fine! i let it cool completely on the stovetop all day before cutting into it. it held together and was pretty undercooked but i preferred it this way!

-  flax egg ( tbsp ground flax mixed with  tbsp water, sit for ten minutes)
- / cup olive oil
- / cup pumpkin puree 
- sea salt
- splash of vanilla
- pinch of baking powder
- pinch of cinnamon 
- pinch of pumpkin pie spice

turn the oven to  degrees. grease a loaf pan and line the bottom with a strip of parchment paper. 

make the flax egg and place to the side, giving it about  minutes to set. 

add all of the dry ingredients to a bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. 

add all of the wet ingredients to a separate bowl and mix thoroughly until well combined. add the now-set flax egg on top and stir through. 

add wet mixture to dry and mix until uniform.

pour batter in loaf pan and bake for  minutes at . see notes above about cooling! topped here with vanilla yogurt.

chunky peanut butter dip: * / cup creamy peanut butter

melt these in a microwave safe bowl for  minutes. it will be super thick so add almond milk to thin into a runnier mixture. i used creamy pb but when it cooked it broke into chunks! dip half of each cookie in the mix and sprinkle with a touch of coconut sugar. set on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and place in the fridge overnight or a few hours to set. .

peanut butter and pretzels AND chocolate‚Ä¶ i'm crying this is a trifecta if i ever saw one.

if you haven't caught on by now, no-bake recipes are my main character trait hahaha. this one is a keeper. THOSE LAYERS ü§©

no-bake triple layer pb pretzel brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- / cup mini gluten free pretzels, chopped into piece
- / cup creamy salted peanut butter
-  tbsp vanilla protein powder of choice OR  tbsp oat flour‚Ä®‚Ä® 
add the crushed pretzels and peanut butter to a bowl and mix until well coated. stir through the protein powder or oat flour to thicken up the mixture and spread onto the base layer.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

jumbo salted almond butter stuffed chocolate cups

chocolate layer:‚Ä®
-  cup chocolate chips 
-  tbsp coconut oil
 ‚Ä®salted almond butter filling:

-  soft pitted dates
- / cup salted almond butter
-  tbsp almond milk
- sea salt
- 
directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth.	emove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer.‚Ä®.‚Ä®.‚Ä®.

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.
