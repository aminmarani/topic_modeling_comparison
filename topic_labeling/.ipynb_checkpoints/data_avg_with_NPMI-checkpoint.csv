Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The Soviets are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a 1994 mission to Mars.  During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration.  Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian surface at night to take measurements.  Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on prevailing winds.","'' Project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown onboard problem and entered a protective ``safing mode'' in which it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue to receive power and find a guide star, said Doyle.  From that position, it was programmed to automatically start a routine of locating the sun, then searching for Earth, Wall said.  The problem with Magellan comes in the wake of NASA's troubles with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.

The advice, if followed, would make it easier _ and less politically painful _ for participants in the budget summit to reach a deficit-reduction deal for 1991.  White House officials and congressional leaders met in the Capitol Thursday for their second round of talks on the $1. 2 trillion budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct.  1."," Officials said the main factors boosting the deficit estimate were the drought, which slowed economic growth this year, and higher-than-expected interest rates, which raised the cost of financing the $2. 6 trillion national debt.  The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's deficit target for 1990 is $100 billion, which means that $32 billion in budget cuts will be needed to close the gap between revenues and spending.  Achieving such sizable cuts in the face of congressional opposition to further reductions in domestic programs will present Bush with major political problems.  During the campaign, Bush sidestepped specifics on how he would deal with the budget deficit by touting a plan for a ``flexible freeze."," He repeated his opposition to development of a new short-range nuclear missile in Europe and questioned buying a new Trident submarine each year and Trident D-5 missiles with nuclear warheads in short supply.  Nunn reserved comment on the B-2 stealth bomber until after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney briefs members of Congress on the Pentagon's review of major aircraft programs.  However, Nunn said the B-2 program of 132 planes at a cost of $72 billion ``must be made more affordable. '' Nunn called for slashing Bush's defense budget authority to $289 billion to $291 billion, about $18 billion less than the president has proposed for fiscal 1991.  Because budget authority represents the amount that can be spent over several years _ such as in a long-term contract to purchase warships _ the cut would force reductions in future Pentagon spending plans."," ``I wouldn't hazard a guess,'' said one, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.  ``These things can go on for so long, and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical mass and then there's an agreement.

Unless some deal is worked out by that date, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will force tens of billions of dollars worth of spending cuts, an amount both parties say is intolerable."," Bargainers concede that with fuel prices rising, raising taxes on gasoline or other sources of energy becomes less palatable.  ``I think it probably will kill any effort to have a broad-based energy tax,'' Gramm said.

In facing up to the well known financial and economic challenges confronting New Brunswickers I hope, and trust, that this government will not neglect  the eduction, health and social needs of New Brunswickers,  of all New Brunswickers, including NB adults with autism disorders.

In consequence there is a little<br />jubilation in the purser’s cabin, Bethel producing a bottle of brandy and Birdsall and<br />Stetson the engineer surreptitiously tapping<br />a keg of whiskey belonging to Cormick, with<br />thorough nautical unscrupulousness, akin to<br />the “Shipmanne’s” in Chaucer.

Third Army Corps:<br />I have the honor to report that under the instructions received through Headquarters Third<br />Army Corps, dated May 4, “to support STONEMAN, and<br />aid him in cutting off the retreat of the enemy,” my<br />Division marched from its camp before Yorktown,<br />about noon that day. <br />We marched toward Williamsburgh.

A wild “hurrah! ”<br />went up from the army, and with a yell that was<br />electric three regiments of Berry’s brigade went to<br />the front, formed a line nearly half a mile long, and<br />commenced a volley firing that no troops on earth<br />could stand before–then at the double-quick dashed<br />with the bayonet at the Rebel array, and sent them<br />flying from the field into their earthworks, pursued<br />them into the largest of them, and drove them out<br />[newspaper_clipping]<br />behind with the pure steel, and then invited them to<br />retake it.  The attempt was repeatedly made, and<br />repeatedly repulsed.  The count of the Rebel dead<br />in that battery at the close of the fight was 63."," Received a letter from Edward Greatbatch, or Bristol, as he always signs himself, dated Camp Montgomery, near Corinth, Miss.  It<br />is written in the lad’s usual artless, ill-spelt manner and tells the story of his recent experience as a <br />soldier.  His regiment was in the thickest of the<br />fight (on the third and fourth of this month) between<br />the rebel force headed by Price, Van Dorn, Villipigue and Lovell, the union men being under command<br />of Rosencrans; the action ending in the “entire route”<br />of the former.  Of 300 of the 52 Illinois Volunteers<br />75 came out “casualties,” only 7 being severely wounded, none killed.  Edward got a bullet sent into<br />his haversack."," In vain<br />would he plead that HEINTZELMAN should have proved<br />a genius; and improvised some stroke of strategy, for<br />the worthy old General has never pretended but to do<br />his duty in his sphere, and the General-in-Chief is<br />head of all to furnish plans, and to expressly blend<br />into a whole the energy of all, which was impossible,<br />as he was not there. <br />In vain will he impute to Gen.  HOOKER the committing himself to a general fight involving the whole<br />army, when a few regiments would have sufficed to<br />hold his own until the designs of the Chief were<br />made known; for it that Chief is miles in the rear <br />when his army is in full career, there are very few<br />Generals, however superior their talents, (and of<br />such class is Gen.  HOOKER,) who, under the longknown duplicity and favoritism and despotism of<br />Gen.
