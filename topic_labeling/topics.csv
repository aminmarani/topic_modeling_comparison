About 250,000 Shiites lived in the slums before the battle began last Friday, but police said 60 percent had fled by Tuesday.  The 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans, are also thought to be held captive in the slums.  Police reported five people wounded by sniper fire.  Gone at least temporarily were the tank, mortar and rocket duels between the Shiite militias Amal and Hezbollah that killed at least 154 people and wounded 372 in the previous four days.	; Sources at the Syrian command said the troops started moving at midday.  One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plan does not cover Hezbollah's main barracks in Hay Madi, where most of the foreign hostages are believed held by Shiite extremists under Hezbollah's wing.  The source said the barracks is considered part of the demarcation line with Christian east Beirut _ the only area of south Beirut where Syria will allow either militia to maintain gunmen.  A Lebanese security source, speaking privately, said the Syrian deployment in Hay Madi will ``tighten the grip on Hezbollah.  It means the kidnappers will not be able to move the hostages from one place to another.	; Hamadi has confessed to the hijacking but denies killing Stethem.  Conwell, a 43-year-old Houston executive, said the last 39 American hostages aboard the seized TWA jetliner were taken off the plane while Hamadi and his accomplice were sleeping.  He said four American servicemen earlier had been removed from the plane by Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran, while the remaining Americans were in the custody of Amal, a more moderate Shiite militia.  As delicate negotiations for the hostages' release ran into snags, Amal officials told Conwell ``the original hijackers were getting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations,'' he testified.  ``I was told the intention was to return all the hostages to the plane and blow it up,'' Conwell said.	; Saad renewed his appeal for the release of the two Red Cross workers, saying failure to free them ``will be considered a hostile act against us. '' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, as well as Palestinian and Lebanese groups, have appealed for the pair's release.  In addition to the two Swiss, the Western hostages believed to be held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon are seven Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.  American journalist Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon.  He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.	; The dead include 97 soldiers killed since the confrontation broke out Jan.  30.  The fighting began when Geagea refused Aoun's demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon.  Geagea's 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of its fighters in east Beirut, the military source said.  They are to defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district.

Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by fish species and location, she said losses to birds have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical fish and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia.  ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,'' Martin said.  ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late summer and early fall.	; Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered birds won't have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season.

Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles north of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America.

ap	;17	;percent, vote, election, voters, poll, votes	; In Budapest, the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats won a plurality of votes in the first round of municipal elections Sept.  30 and was leading in Sunday's second round.  The liberal Free Democrats led with 36 percent of the vote in Budapest, with about 17 percent of the ballots counted, state-run television reported.  The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the strongest force in Parliament, had about 25 percent.  The results in Budapest and other urban centers are seen as a test for the center-right coalition government of Jozsef Antall, six months after national elections.	; The Post survey, done June 15-19, found a 51-39 percent Dukakis margin.  The ABC-Money Magazine poll, conducted June 22-25, found support for Dukakis down 7 points from an ABC-Post poll in mid-May that used the same methodology.  Bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent support; those who didn't know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent.  The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else.  Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories.	; Those with a favorable view rose 9 points to 52.  The national survey found a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week.  His favorable rating fell from 49 percent to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 percent Sunday to 44 percent Wednesday.  The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, found little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21.  Dukakis' 12-point lead against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May.	; Public approval of President Bush's handling of the economy and his handling of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait dropped in recent weeks, according to a CBS News-New York Times poll released Saturday.  Bush's 60 percent overall approval rating in the poll is the worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their administrations.  The poll found a majority of Americans still approves of Bush's actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 percent approval rating is down from 75 percent soon after the invasion.  The poll found 34 percent disapproved of Bush's handling of Iraq.  Asked to rate Bush's handling of the economy, 52 percent said they disapproved and 36 percent said they approved.	; President Bush has a 56 percent approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll.  Only 13 percent of blacks supported Reagan at about the same point in his presidency, CBS Evening News reported Thursday.  In May 1982, Reagan had a 73 percent disapproval rating among blacks; in the current poll, 26 percent of blacks surveyed disapproved of Bush, said Kathleen A.  Frankovic, of the CBS network's polling division.  CBS-Times polls conducted during Reagan's entire time in office found he had an average 67 percent disapproval rating among blacks, Frankovic said.
ap	;17	;percent, vote, election, voters, poll, votes	; In Budapest, the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats won a plurality of votes in the first round of municipal elections Sept.  30 and was leading in Sunday's second round.  The liberal Free Democrats led with 36 percent of the vote in Budapest, with about 17 percent of the ballots counted, state-run television reported.  The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the strongest force in Parliament, had about 25 percent.  The results in Budapest and other urban centers are seen as a test for the center-right coalition government of Jozsef Antall, six months after national elections.	; The Post survey, done June 15-19, found a 51-39 percent Dukakis margin.  The ABC-Money Magazine poll, conducted June 22-25, found support for Dukakis down 7 points from an ABC-Post poll in mid-May that used the same methodology.  Bush rose only from 41 to 42 percent support; those who didn't know grew from 2 percent to 6 percent.  The rest said they wouldn't vote or would support someone else.  Poll analysts have said they expected the race to tighten as Dukakis came off the crest of his Democratic primary victories.	; Those with a favorable view rose 9 points to 52.  The national survey found a rise in unfavorable views of Bush, who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week.  His favorable rating fell from 49 percent to 41 percent, while those viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 percent Sunday to 44 percent Wednesday.  The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the convention, found little change in his favorable-unfavorable rating, 55-21.  Dukakis' 12-point lead against Bush did not mark his greatest numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led by 53-40 in late May.	; Public approval of President Bush's handling of the economy and his handling of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait dropped in recent weeks, according to a CBS News-New York Times poll released Saturday.  Bush's 60 percent overall approval rating in the poll is the worst of his presidency, but still higher than that recorded for Presidents Reagan and Carter at the same point in their administrations.  The poll found a majority of Americans still approves of Bush's actions in the Persian Gulf, but the 57 percent approval rating is down from 75 percent soon after the invasion.  The poll found 34 percent disapproved of Bush's handling of Iraq.  Asked to rate Bush's handling of the economy, 52 percent said they disapproved and 36 percent said they approved.	; President Bush has a 56 percent approval rating among blacks, a huge increase over the ratings given former President Reagan, according to a new CBS News-New York Times poll.

Aspirin-free pain relievers and name-brand aspirin products competed with each other until the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a report in 1982, said giving aspirin to children suffering from chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting Reye's syndrome.  The illness is fatal in about 20 percent to 30 percent of the cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage.  The government in 1986 ordered warning labels on all aspirin bottles about the risk to children and teen-agers of contracting Reye's syndrome.	; ``If we lose this one, we'll never get it back,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, who is lobbying the Senate to reject the nominee.  Smeal said she had read all 200 of Souter's legal opinions and believes he would work to cut off women's access to birth control and abortion.  Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Souter revealed his opposition to abortion by calling it the ``killing of unborn children. '' ``That's the language of the right wing,'' Yard said.  Souter did not use the words during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week, but while New Hampshire attorney general he signed a brief that contained the language.

On Wednesday night, he brought out a dazzling show of glamorous clothes for rich women, the outfits looking particularly light and young.  He led off and ended with swingy, short clothes in his original signature color of white, suits cut with longer jackets and short skirts, waves of accordion pleats around for dancing skirts.  Otherwise, Valentino spiced the show with lots of his favorite hot reds and soft tones like celdadon, wisteria, peach and silvery gray in the softest of fabrics like cashmere, silk crepe and acres of flounced chiffon _ a Paris must for couture.

ap	;30	;bank, billion, million, money, banks, financial	; The Federal Home Loan Bank Board today announced a record $1. 35 billion cash payout to shut down two insolvent savings institutions in Costa Mesa, Calif.  The bank board, which regulates 3,150 S&Ls, said it will begin on Tuesday to pay off deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 in the North America Savings and Loan Association and the American Diversified Savings Bank.  M.  Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said it was the largest cash payout ever for the agency.	; William Seidman said Monday.  Seidman said a loss to the insurance fund, if any, would depend on how much the FDIC spends to resolve the problems of First RepublicBank of Dallas, which earlier this month received a $1 billion infusion of government aid.  The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on real estate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of the insurance fund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700 commercial banks.  Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Seidman said it is too soon to say with certainty what the cost of restoring First RepublicBank to health will be.  But, he said the $5 billion to $6 billion estimates of some are ``far higher than anything that is likely to be required.	; Strauss.  First Texas Financial is the parent company of Dallas-based First Texas Savings Association and Houston-based Gibraltar Savings Association.  The plan would provide more than $250 million in private funds in return for an undetermined amount from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , a First Texas spokeswoman who wished to remain anonymous said Thursday.  ``I can confirm there has been an offer and that we are optimistic about it, but at this time, we don't know how much federal money is involved,'' she said.	; Through the first nine months of last year, thrift institutions were troubled by what industry analysts called a ``slow-motion run'' as uncertain depositors withdrew their money.  However, after the October stock market crash, investors pulled their money out of risky stock investments and put it into insured S&L and bank acounts.  James Barth, chief economist at the bank board, said there was no obvious explanation for the May deposit drain, but he noted that commercial banks and money market mutual funds experienced a similar decline.  Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va. , industry analyst, said S&Ls appear to be trying to resist the rise in interest rates and thus are attracting fewer deposits.	; The Treasury Department announced Wednesday it was selling $2. 56 billion in 20-year bonds to the government of Mexico as part of an innovative effort to help solve that country's debt problems.

ap	;24	;air, airlines, airline, eastern, pilots, service	; Five American airlines have been authorized to open passenger and cargo service to Tokyo and other cities in Japan, the Department of Transportation announced on Monday.  Three air carriers - United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines - were authorized to serve Tokyo.  Delta, America West Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were authorized to serve two other Japanese cities, Nagoya and Fukuoka.  The route awards were granted under a November 1989 agreement which laid the foundation for a major expansion of air service between the United States and Japan.  In making the announcement the department noted that the U.	;'' The order brings to 1,002 the total number of orders for the 747 series jets, making it the fourth civil airplane type in history to surpass the 1,000-mark in sales, Boeing said.  The other models are Boeing's 727 and 737 series and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series.  In dollar terms, the deal puts JAL in a four-way tie for fourth place among all Boeing orders with All Nippon Airways, United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  The largest Boeing order ever was made by GPA Ltd.  in May 1989, with 182 planes worth $9.	; The obscure cargo airline that Eastern Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces questions about its safety record as the government decides whether it is fit to carry passengers.  Few air travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as United Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator.  But if labor strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that airline's customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _ and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up scrutiny of the airline.  Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including the leasing of 26 of Eastern's jetliners, that call on the airline to take over much of Eastern's routes if pilots and mechanics go on strike.  Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own pilots and ground workers, Eastern officials said.	; A strike by air traffic controllers demanding better working conditions has shut down all airports in the country.  The walkout began Thursday morning and affected international flights by the Salvadoran airline Taca, the Costa Rican national airline Lacsa, the Panamanian airline Copa, Pan American World Airways and the Honduran airline Sahsa.  All domestic flights also were affected.  The Air Traffic Controllers Union is demanding a salary review, improvements in training and an overhaul of equipment.	; Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said officials have been unsatisfied with Eastern's performance since its takeover in 1986 by Texas Air Corp. , which will undergo a 30-day inspection of its operating practices.  Texas Air, which commands a fifth of the nation's air travel market, also owns Continental Airlines, which has recently absorbed Frontier Airlines, People Express and New York Air.  The government's financial probe will examine the corporation's management and business practices and the relationships between the parent and the two airlines, said B.

Three air carriers - United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines - were authorized to serve Tokyo.  Delta, America West Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were authorized to serve two other Japanese cities, Nagoya and Fukuoka.

The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives.  The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black opposition movements, both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and a future South Africa.  The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government.  Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism.	; Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947.  Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir.  Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population nationwide.  Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the militants now demand independence and the status of a neutral country.  India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir.	; The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence.  Three men were killed by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese extremists tried to attack government property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.  He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with extremists in Hambantota district in the south.  In southern and central Sri Lanka, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said.

Officials claim Grosskopf carried out that bombing and at least one other on orders from the outlawed African National Congress, the predominantly black guerrilla group fighting to end domination by South Africa's white minority.  Botha gave no reason why police decided to search Loeser's home and coupled his apology with an attack on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany for suggesting a boycott of South African products as a means of protesting the apartheid racial policy.

ap	;28	;china, chinese, french, paris, france, hong	; The Communist government for the first time has allowed the family of a high-level defector to go abroad to visit him and it is considering letting him return from China, an official said Saturday.  The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move was meant as a gesture of good will toward China before the visit of Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem to Beijing.  It will be Liem's third round of talks in China on the Cambodian civil war and other barriers to normalizing ties between Vietnam and China.  The Vietnamese government allowed the wife and daughter of 87-year-old defector Hoang Van Hoan _ a founding member of the Vietnamese Communist Party _ to travel to Beijing to visit him last month, the government official said.  The decision was made by the Politburo, the highest body of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, he said.	; The Marlboro man has corralled his last horse and Salem's ``springtime'' has ended on Hong Kong TV following a cigarette ad ban that began today in this British colony.  The ban is part of a growing campaign in Asia against tobacco companies, which have been accused of targeting Asia's women and children.  In a related development, Hong Kong's legislature has urged the government to ban children under the age of 15 from smoking in restaurants.  ``Smoking parties'' where a group of young people lounge around a table and chain-smoke cigarettes is a popular pastime in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is also readying legislation to ban smoking in ferries, buses, taxis, government buildings, cinemas and theaters.	; Police released Gao and Zhou, who had previously spent months in prison, after the anniversary of the June 4 crackdown had passed.  But Hou was taken out to sea, put on a Taiwanese fishing boat and returned to Taiwan.  Also Monday, China announced that another dissident arrested last summer, Wang Xuezhi, was being released from a Canton prison and allowed to go abroad to rejoin his French wife.  China appears to have concluded that exiling dissenters such as Fang and Hou serves both to ease Western criticism of China's human rights record and diminish their ability to influence opinion at home.  Those who left or escaped after the military crackdown _ people like student leader Wu'er Kaixi, political scientist Yan Jiaqi and entrepreneur Wan Runnan _ say they fear the world is gradually losing interest in China.	; ...  Incidents of arrest and torture, these also continue,'' said the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of his people.  He said he feared that ``in 15 years, if present conditions don't change, the Tibetan community will become insignificant in its own land,'' now a province of China.  About 6 million Tibetans still live in their homeland, but they are outnumbered by Chinese even in Tibet.  ``After 40 years of Chinese occupation, much of Tibet's civilization has been destroyed,'' the Dalai Lama said.	; A French assault team today stormed a cave in this French Pacific territory and freed 22 gendarmes and a prosecutor held hostage by Melanesian separatists.  An official said 17 people were killed.  Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in the conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac of France, said the dead included two members of the assault team and 15 kidnappers.

ap	;28	;china, chinese, french, paris, france, hong	; The Communist government for the first time has allowed the family of a high-level defector to go abroad to visit him and it is considering letting him return from China, an official said Saturday.  The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move was meant as a gesture of good will toward China before the visit of Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem to Beijing.  It will be Liem's third round of talks in China on the Cambodian civil war and other barriers to normalizing ties between Vietnam and China.  The Vietnamese government allowed the wife and daughter of 87-year-old defector Hoang Van Hoan _ a founding member of the Vietnamese Communist Party _ to travel to Beijing to visit him last month, the government official said.  The decision was made by the Politburo, the highest body of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, he said.	; The Marlboro man has corralled his last horse and Salem's ``springtime'' has ended on Hong Kong TV following a cigarette ad ban that began today in this British colony.  The ban is part of a growing campaign in Asia against tobacco companies, which have been accused of targeting Asia's women and children.  In a related development, Hong Kong's legislature has urged the government to ban children under the age of 15 from smoking in restaurants.  ``Smoking parties'' where a group of young people lounge around a table and chain-smoke cigarettes is a popular pastime in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is also readying legislation to ban smoking in ferries, buses, taxis, government buildings, cinemas and theaters.	; Police released Gao and Zhou, who had previously spent months in prison, after the anniversary of the June 4 crackdown had passed.  But Hou was taken out to sea, put on a Taiwanese fishing boat and returned to Taiwan.  Also Monday, China announced that another dissident arrested last summer, Wang Xuezhi, was being released from a Canton prison and allowed to go abroad to rejoin his French wife.  China appears to have concluded that exiling dissenters such as Fang and Hou serves both to ease Western criticism of China's human rights record and diminish their ability to influence opinion at home.  Those who left or escaped after the military crackdown _ people like student leader Wu'er Kaixi, political scientist Yan Jiaqi and entrepreneur Wan Runnan _ say they fear the world is gradually losing interest in China.	; ...  Incidents of arrest and torture, these also continue,'' said the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of his people.  He said he feared that ``in 15 years, if present conditions don't change, the Tibetan community will become insignificant in its own land,'' now a province of China.  About 6 million Tibetans still live in their homeland, but they are outnumbered by Chinese even in Tibet.  ``After 40 years of Chinese occupation, much of Tibet's civilization has been destroyed,'' the Dalai Lama said.	; A French assault team today stormed a cave in this French Pacific territory and freed 22 gendarmes and a prosecutor held hostage by Melanesian separatists.  An official said 17 people were killed.  Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in the conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac of France, said the dead included two members of the assault team and 15 kidnappers.

ap	;89	;west, east, german, israel, germany, israeli	; Hussein and Peres, of the left-leaning Labor Party, agreed last year to hold direct talks in the framework of an international peace conference.  The accord was vetoed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud Bloc.  Peres, speaking on Israel radio, said Jordan remained crucial to a resolution of the Palestinian problem because the 850,000 West Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports, the West Bank and Jordan have strong trade links, and Israel and Jordan share a long border.  In Gaza City, Shawaa, known for his pro-Jordanian views, said in an interview that the move was ``regrettable because people here need help, and this was an important source of help. '' But Mustafa Natsche, deposed mayor of the West Bank city of Hebron and a PLO supporter, said ``the Amman decision will not affect anybody.	; Ms.  Viett's capture and the June 6 apprehension of another suspect, Sussanne Albrecht, represent some of the biggest successes against West German terrorists in years.  The West German newspaper Bild said that officials in East and West were close to arresting terrorist suspect Silke Maier-Witt in East Germany.  ``Every day, we are counting on seeing the news of her arrest,'' Bild quoted one unidentified West German official as saying.  Bild is known to have close ties to government security officials in Bonn.	; A 36-year-old East German man fled uninjured over the heavily fortified border to West Germany by climbing fences under cover of darkness, border police said.  The man crossed the frontier late Thursday near the West German community of Philippsthal, 90 miles northeast of Frankfurt, said border police in Kassel.  The escapee was not identified.  At least 17 people have fled over East Germany's border with West Germany and the Communist-constructed Berlin Wall since Jan.  1, according to West German officials.	; In Hamburg, the respected newsmagazie Der Spiegel reported West German counterintelligence officials were stepping up surveillance of the far right.  ``Right-wing groups increasingly are striking up contacts in East Germany and getting good feedback there,'' the magazine reported.  West Germany's extreme rightist Republican Party, despite facing mounting troubles at home, claims to have found recruits in East Germany since November's peaceful revolution.  Der Spiegel quoted officials as saying in a report that ``after 40 years of political oppression, it follows as a matter of course that there will be radical to extreme rightist developments. '' Ultrarightists have tried to disrupt the weekly pro-democracy demonstrations in Leipzig several times.	; The decision came Monday after a plea from Shamir, who asked the committee in a letter to allocate the funds to the Housing Ministry.  A copy of Shamir's letter was obtained by The Associated Press.  Shamir asked that the money be used to develop settlements and roads beyond the Green Line, which divides Israel from the territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East War.  A Shamir spokesman insisted the money would be used only to improve existing settlements, not build new ones.  Two new settlements established by Shamir's caretaker government have sparked protests from the United States, which says settlements in the occupied areas are an obstacle to peacemaking.

Frances Allison said her son, Gary DeWayne Morris, has nightmares and refuses to sleep without a light since the incident last March.

The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high point of a five-day visit by a 78-member North Korean sports delegation, the first from the Communist north to visit the south since the 1945 division of the peninsula.  South Korean soccer players visited the north earlier this month.

Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided Korean peninsula by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the tension, Carlucci said.  ``It is most unfortunate that the north continues its trouble-making role and remains unwilling to make the simple concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the peninsula,'' he said.  Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at the start of the 20th annual U.	; ``The citizens ought to control their schools, the citizens ought to determine the climate in which their children learn,'' said Annemarie DuBois, union director.  ``It is not necesssary to take the public out of public education.

ap	;60	;space, shuttle, nasa, launch, mission, earth	; With Magellan safely in orbit around Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.  ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and volcanoes,'' said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar imaging system.  Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The mapping is set to start next month.  On Friday, Magellan plunged over the north pole of Venus, fired its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.	; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't yet have specific plans to put rovers on Mars, Bedard said.  The Soviets are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a 1994 mission to Mars.  During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration.  Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian surface at night to take measurements.  Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on prevailing winds.	;'' Project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown onboard problem and entered a protective ``safing mode'' in which it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue to receive power and find a guide star, said Doyle.  From that position, it was programmed to automatically start a routine of locating the sun, then searching for Earth, Wall said.  The problem with Magellan comes in the wake of NASA's troubles with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.  Magellan's formal mission to map the surface of Venus is supposed to start Aug.  29.	; When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense heat and pressure vaporize it.  The orbiter will photograph and study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.  But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew members raised safety concerns.  NASA decided against using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur.	; A set of valleys said to resemble the animated character Gumby and a meteorite impact crater unlike any other seen in the solar system are visible in the Magellan spacecraft's newest pictures of Venus.  The computer-assembled pictures, released by NASA Monday, were made from data Magellan collected Saturday as it started its 243-day mission to peer through the planet's thick clouds and map its rugged landscape.  ``It's just excitement time.  The scientists are in there like bees to honey,'' said Ed Sherry, a Magellan technical assistant at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  One picture shows a 40-mile-long set of valleys or troughs.

ap	;60	;space, shuttle, nasa, launch, mission, earth	; With Magellan safely in orbit around Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped the landscape of the hellishly hot planet.  ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and volcanoes,'' said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar imaging system.  Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  The mapping is set to start next month.  On Friday, Magellan plunged over the north pole of Venus, fired its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface.	; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't yet have specific plans to put rovers on Mars, Bedard said.  The Soviets are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a 1994 mission to Mars.  During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration.  Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian surface at night to take measurements.  Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on prevailing winds.	;'' Project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown onboard problem and entered a protective ``safing mode'' in which it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue to receive power and find a guide star, said Doyle.  From that position, it was programmed to automatically start a routine of locating the sun, then searching for Earth, Wall said.  The problem with Magellan comes in the wake of NASA's troubles with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.  Magellan's formal mission to map the surface of Venus is supposed to start Aug.  29.	; When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense heat and pressure vaporize it.  The orbiter will photograph and study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle.  But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew members raised safety concerns.

ap	;62	;billion, budget, bush, deficit, congress, spending	; Budget negotiators should limit next year's deficit cuts to $50 billion to $60 billion, far less than the law requires, say top fiscal experts for Congress and the Bush administration.  The advice, if followed, would make it easier _ and less politically painful _ for participants in the budget summit to reach a deficit-reduction deal for 1991.  White House officials and congressional leaders met in the Capitol Thursday for their second round of talks on the $1. 2 trillion budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct.  1.	; Officials said the main factors boosting the deficit estimate were the drought, which slowed economic growth this year, and higher-than-expected interest rates, which raised the cost of financing the $2. 6 trillion national debt.  The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's deficit target for 1990 is $100 billion, which means that $32 billion in budget cuts will be needed to close the gap between revenues and spending.  Achieving such sizable cuts in the face of congressional opposition to further reductions in domestic programs will present Bush with major political problems.  During the campaign, Bush sidestepped specifics on how he would deal with the budget deficit by touting a plan for a ``flexible freeze.	; He repeated his opposition to development of a new short-range nuclear missile in Europe and questioned buying a new Trident submarine each year and Trident D-5 missiles with nuclear warheads in short supply.  Nunn reserved comment on the B-2 stealth bomber until after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney briefs members of Congress on the Pentagon's review of major aircraft programs.  However, Nunn said the B-2 program of 132 planes at a cost of $72 billion ``must be made more affordable. '' Nunn called for slashing Bush's defense budget authority to $289 billion to $291 billion, about $18 billion less than the president has proposed for fiscal 1991.  Because budget authority represents the amount that can be spent over several years _ such as in a long-term contract to purchase warships _ the cut would force reductions in future Pentagon spending plans.	; ``I wouldn't hazard a guess,'' said one, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.  ``These things can go on for so long, and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical mass and then there's an agreement. '' After five weeks and eight private sessions, the Democratic and Republican sides agree that somewhere between $45 billion and $60 billion in new taxes and spending cuts are needed for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct.  1.  Unless some deal is worked out by that date, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will force tens of billions of dollars worth of spending cuts, an amount both parties say is intolerable.	; Bargainers concede that with fuel prices rising, raising taxes on gasoline or other sources of energy becomes less palatable.  ``I think it probably will kill any effort to have a broad-based energy tax,'' Gramm said.  Congressional leaders and Bush administration officials have struggled inconclusively since May to forge a package of tax increases and spending cuts totaling $50 billion for next year and $500 billion over five years.  The summit talks are on hold for Congress' August recess.  Iraq's takeover of Kuwait _ and resulting military and economic moves by the United States and its allies _ means the American economy could be weaker when the bargainers reconvene in September.

asd	;1	;school, education, students, special, schools, teachers	;  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> STATEMENT <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Learning Disabilities Association of Canada (LDAC) does not support full  <br /> <br /> educational inclusion or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,  or treatment of all students with learning disabilities or the idea that all students with learning disabilities must be served only in regular education classrooms at the exclusion of all other special education placement options.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> LDAC believes that full inclusion, when defined this way, violates the rights of parents and students with disabilities guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedom and Human Rights Codes which guarantee education equality and freedom from discrimination and rejects the arbitrary placement of all students in any one setting.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> LDAC supports the availability of a continuum of education services as prescribed in an individual educational plan for each student with learning disabilities to ensure success and must be flexible enough to meet the changing needs of students with learning disabilities by:   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1) Providing a range of options and services and diverse learning environments  <br /> <br /> (placements) to meet the specific needs of each student;   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2) Providing the most enabling environment for that student that will effectively meet the student’s best interests socially, emotionally, behaviourally, physically and educationally; and,  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3) Focus on what is in the best interest of the student and, in that context, consider all the needs of the student as expressed by the student and his/her parents and that of their consulting professionals.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> RATIONALE  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because each student with learning disabilities has unique needs, an individualized education plan and placement must be tailored on individual strengths and needs.  For one student, the plan may be provided in the regular classroom yet for another student, the regular classroom may be an inappropriate placement and may need alternative instructional environments, teaching strategies, and/or materials that cannot or will not be provided within the context of the regular classroom environment.	;  It seems odd that I’m actually considering this, because, years ago, I was committed to ensuring all of my children had the benefits of an inclusive educational environment.   Unfortunately, in this school district, that goal was unattainable.  <br /> Alex and Ben have both been placed in segregated school environments since they entered elementary school, where they have minimal interactions with regular education peers.   They have primarily attended school in what is called a “CD” or cognitively disabled classroom—a classroom positioned “off to the side” of the regular classrooms that is designed specifically for children with more severe special needs.   More recently, Ben has been pulled out of even this environment and placed in an even more isolated classroom due to his behaviors.	;
<br /> The idea of  reasonable expectations  encapsulates that idea that there are standards that should be met.   This idea translates in a great many ways.  <br /> As a parent and an advocate, it means: <br /> <br />  I have a reasonable expectation for my children’s special needs to be met while they are in school.  <br /> I have a reasonable expectation for my children’s educational needs to be while they are in school.  <br /> I have a reasonable expectation that both needs are equally important and one should not have to be compromised to meet the other.	;  Unfortunately that does not appear to be the case particularly in New Brunswick where the extreme full mainstream classroom inclusion model has been pushed relentlessly by Gordon Porter, the New Brunswick Association for Community Living and senior officials in the Department of Education.    <br /> Meanwhile some children, including some autistic children, for whom the mainstream classroom is not the right learning environment are forced into situations where they injure themselves, or others, in order to get out of an environment which is not the right option for them; an environment that overwhelms and harms therm.   My son, fortunately, has been accommodated in a separate learning environment for his primary ABA based instruction in our neighborhood schools with time spent in common areas of the school for other activities where he does get to interact with other students.   Conor was removed from the mainstream classroom, at our request, after he came home every day with bite marks on his hands and wrists.   He has been well accommodated by our schools and our school district.	;<br />"Good teachers are to education what education is to all other professions—the indispensable element, the sunlight and oxygen, the foundation on which everything else is built."  -- Lowell Milken <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This is especially true when it comes to teachers for children with disabilities like autism, ADHD, and dyslexia, among other common learning and/or neurological disorders.  I wouldn't be surprised if most if not all parents of special needs students haven't run up against teachers whose education was inadequate to the task, especially when are children are mainstreamed with regular education teachers.

While studies varied as to the    magnitude of gains, all have demonstrated long term retention of gains made.    Other major contributions of ABA to the education and treatment of individuals with  autism     include:       •   a large number of empirically-based systematic instruction methods that lead to the        acquisition of skills, and to the decrease/elimination of aberrant behaviors;         •   a technology for systematically evaluating the efficacy of interventions intended to affect       individual learning and behavior; and        •   substantial cost/benefit.        Over 30 years of rigorous research and peer review of applied behavior analysis’ effectiveness    for individuals with  autism  demonstrate ABA has been objectively substantiated as effective    based upon the scope and quality of science.  Professionals considering applied behavior   analysis should portray the method as objectively substantiated as effective.	;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Research to date benefiting persons suffering from autism disorders can be summed up in two words:  Lovaas ,  ABA.

And it is the sounds of the words that have stayed with me, so that  "Aprill, with his shoures soote"  bears the  accent  of spring.  <br /><br /> Charlie's words to explain this  change of seasons  are more to the point.  <br /><br /> At the speech therapist late this afternoon, he sat, face  open and attentive , eyes sliding to the side as he listened hard.	;  <br /><br /> Jim has been noting Charlie's sitting-on-the-edge-of-the-back-seat interest to certain CDs: <br /><br /> Don Sugarcane Harris , blues violonist.  <br /> John Coltrane , on the saxophone.  <br /> Jimi Hendrix , on electric guitar.  <br /><br /> This is not the music I like to listen to while driving solo (=rushing to pick up Charlie); I favor melody-driven, emotion-packed songs about the heart by  female singers .   <br /><br /> And then I hear Charlie humming "uh wub suh-peeem, uh wub suh-peeem," echoing Coltrane's "A Love Supreme."	;<br /> Read the color of the words below (not the actual words), try to do it as fast as you can.  Is it difficult?  How many Fs can you see?  Finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with the experience of years...  Even though the letters are jumbled in the following paragraph,most people have no trouble reading it!	; They are words that I have said in Charlie's presence, and that he has repeated after a space of up to a minute.   <br /><br /> Echolalia  is not a bad thing around here.  I know that it is one of those DSM-IV symptoms---"red flags"---that can scream "this child may have autism!!!!".  And it would certainly be at least a bit grating on the parental ears to hear everything one's mom-self had said instantly repeated by one's child.  <br /><br /> But you see, once upon a time,  Charlie could not talk at all .	; And this afternoon he sang some syllables that sounded like "tubby little cubby".   This was all very faint and garbled, but so wonderful to hear.    When I hear him singing a string of words, it makes me wonder what it will be like to hear him speak in phrases or sentences.

Went round to Haney’s<br />to talk it over, thought I’d stand it; went up<br />town to a Protestant Evangelical Knowledge<br />Society where I heard some of the vilest bigotry<br />ever vented.

Then to Presbyterian Church with Wing.  (“John Presbyter” has altered since Hudibrastic<br />days – fine organ, and sermon exhorting charity and christian spirit to<br />those differing in creed ).  That was the better part of the sermon.  For<br />the rest, the subject was too great for the preacher,) as it would have<br />been for most of his class.	;<br /> V. <br />When the battle rages round,<br />And the rolling of the drum,<br />And the trembling of the ground<br />Tell usurpers that WE COME! –<br />Then the War’s deep-rolling thunder<br />Shall our lightnings cleave asunder,<br />And our enemies shall wonder<br />At the British Volunteers;<br />Shall wonder at the cheers<br />Of the British Volunteers! <br /> VI. <br />God of Freedom!	; Drawing & down town.  To Franklin<br />Street for meals.  Welden called, requesting me as I intended<br />to hear Theodore Parker lecture at the Tabernacle this night,<br />to take his wife also.  Down town with him, to the “Times”<br />Office; – introduced to Raymond the Editor.  Office again.

Third Army Corps:<br />I have the honor to report that under the instructions received through Headquarters Third<br />Army Corps, dated May 4, “to support STONEMAN, and<br />aid him in cutting off the retreat of the enemy,” my<br />Division marched from its camp before Yorktown,<br />about noon that day. <br />We marched toward Williamsburgh.  After advancing five or six miles on this road, I learned that<br />Brig.	;<br />He ran to the nearest band and ordered it to meet<br />the coming regiments with “Yankee Doodle,”<br />and to give them marching time into the field<br />with the Star-spangled Banner.  A wild “hurrah! ”<br />went up from the army, and with a yell that was<br />electric three regiments of Berry’s brigade went to<br />the front, formed a line nearly half a mile long, and<br />commenced a volley firing that no troops on earth<br />could stand before–then at the double-quick dashed<br />with the bayonet at the Rebel array, and sent them<br />flying from the field into their earthworks, pursued<br />them into the largest of them, and drove them out<br />[newspaper_clipping]<br />behind with the pure steel, and then invited them to<br />retake it.  The attempt was repeatedly made, and<br />repeatedly repulsed.  The count of the Rebel dead<br />in that battery at the close of the fight was 63.	; Received a letter from Edward Greatbatch, or Bristol, as he always signs himself, dated Camp Montgomery, near Corinth, Miss.  It<br />is written in the lad’s usual artless, ill-spelt manner and tells the story of his recent experience as a <br />soldier.

gunn	;43	;auction, balls, trumps, grandfather, india-rubber, sale	;” and exit in a rush;<br />doctor comes, and the anxious messenger also<br />comes, with 400 marbles in 8 canvas bags,<br />with a toy-ship, five india-rubber balls, and a<br />small wheelbarrow; baby cries more; doctor<br />and four more kites, and twenty-one india-rubber balls (a bargain), come to cure the<br />dear boy of diphtheria; baby gets a pepper-mint-lozenge in his throat, and coughs; five<br />doctors called in quick succession to cure him<br />of hooping-cough; as the doctors are leaving the house, they are met by a man with a<br />cart containing a rocking-horse, fourteen<br />wooly dogs on wheels, four-dozen India-rub-ber balls, and three pecks of marbles–all in<br />charge of the anxious Grandfather from Patafornia. <br />Trumps gets out-doors on side-walk, plays<br />with stray children from tenement-house in<br />contiguous street; comes home, red spot on<br />his neck; his Grandmother says it’s his wis-dom-teeth coming through; his Grandfather<br />gives one shrill scream and dashes off at 2:40<br />speed for a doctor; two doctors–seven doctors, all the doctors in the neighborhood;<br />they come, are told by Grandfather that the<br />child is in the last agonies of death from<br />scarlet-fever; Grandfather himself lingers,<br />and at last comes in, with a large clothes-basket full of Indian-rubber balls, and half a<br />barrel of marbles; he meets the doctors departing, and in answer to his eager inquiry<br />as to whether he shall go for an undertaker<br />yet, one doctor, an Allopathist, who believes<br />in powerful doses, gives him a terrific swearing at for calling fourteen physicians to look<br />at a mosquito-bite; Grandfather collapses, is<br />afraid to come into the house, where he will<br />meet the Grandmother, and hear her prove<br />that the doctors are all wrong, and that nothing ails the “dear baby” but his teeth.  So the<br />Grandfather departs, and in a fit of absence<br />of mind he enters a toy-shop, buys three dozen dumb watches, twenty-six five-inch India-rubber balls, four sets of wooden soldiers, a<br />large India-rubber ball, five four-inch India-rubber balls, a box of nine-pins, a bag of<br />marbles, a dozen and a half solid India-rubber<br />balls, a toy-goat, a large India-rubber menagerie, comprising lions, bears, tigers, two<br />elephants, and a two-foot assortment of animals with squeaks in their stomachs, an In-dia-rubber foot-ball, some pewter plates, and<br />knives and forks, a tin locomotive engine<br />with iron tender, tin cars, and lead passengers,<br />all complete, a whip, a whistle, a rattle-box,<br />an India-rubber ball, a pair of skates big<br />enough for a man, a cricket-bat, a toy theatre,<br />a bag of marbles, and an India-rubber ball;<br />then, when he got on the steps of home, he<br />suddenly exclaimed that he had forgotten<br />something; dropped all his purchase in the<br />hall, and took a hack for down-town, whence,<br />in the course of an hour, he returned triumphantly with an India-rubber ball. <br />If the baby winks one eye, his Grandmother says he’s got a tooth coming there; if he<br />sneezes, she looks carefully into his nostrils<br />to see if some of his teeth haven’t taken a<br />wrong direction, and are coming through; if<br />he knocks his head and raises a lump on the<br />back of his skull, his Grandmother instantly<br />takes her scissors and a razor, and carefully<br />shaves the spot bare, so that when the tooth<br />comes through, it needn’t be turned sideways<br />by the hair.  She has, on several occasions,<br />poulticed his leg, under the belief that he is<br />going to have teeth all along his shin; and<br />whenever he stubs his toe, she looks at the <br />place, expecting to see a double tooth, while <br />his Grandfather rushes out for an India-rubber<br />ball.	; To me, whose faith in the achievements of<br />man has always been large and hopeful, the incredulity<br />of most folks about this enterprise has been surprising. <br />Not an American, excepting perhaps Haney, do I know, who<br />believed in it’s success.  Only yesterday “Doesticks” was denouncing it to me as a humbug; my Doctor as quite edifying, a<br />week ago on his skepticism.  I suppose the majority are<br />always inclined to be on the old world, conservative side;<br />if the thing fail they then pride themselves on their superior<br />sagacity, if it be a success every body is so well pleased<br />that all croakings and croakers are forgotten.  I’ve noticed<br />this in relation to the friends or attendants on sick people.	; And they’d retaliate,<br />and tell her of it.  Next day she’d repent and try to shuffle<br />off paying.
