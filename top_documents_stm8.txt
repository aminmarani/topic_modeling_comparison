Doc ID: 10051, distribution: 0.8638558132868824 ; eat foods to FUEL your body AND your soul, not just to tied you over until the next time you eat.  i used to be someone who would opt for high volume low calorie foods whenever i could. brunch? i'll take the egg white scramble. ice cream? i'll get sorbet. starving at dinner? i'll make a giant salad or big bowl of veggies. craving chocolate? i'll load up on fruit.  while sometimes a bunch of veggies or sorbet is legitimately what i'm craving, other times, it's important to listen to what my body ~actually~ wants and honor that.
——
i used to be scared of not being full, so i'd play mind games with myself and eat giant bowls of lower calorie foods thinking eating large quantities would make me less likely to binge later. in my head, i'd wonder why would anyone choose eating a cup of cooked rice when you could eat  cups of steamed veggies for the same calories.  but, even though i was eating a ton of volume, i would never feel completely satisfied, and i'd still end up binging at night.
——
now that i choose to eat whatever tf i want and foods that will actually fuel my body and my soul (like this loaded veggie pizza) and satisfy me rather than just “keep me full”, i actually find myself not feeling the need to finish everything i eat and eating less (i can actually eat half a pint of ice cream now instead NEEDING to finish the whole thing 😱) while also feeling MORE content than when i was technically eating more. health can be simple...wild, right?

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

My only other official running race previously has been the London Marathon last year, so I am super happy I entered and of course, the biggest shoutout to my supporters, camera crew, alternative vloggers and bag carriers 😏 . . . you know who you are 👀
-
The Berlin vlog was episode  in the Germany series (link in my bio), but if I had to pick my top  recommendations then I'd say the following:
-
🇩🇪 Go and chill at Tempelhof, the decommissioned airport  ✈️
-
🇩🇪 Vegan or not, you mustttt try the doughnuts from @brammibalsdonuts  😍
-
🇩🇪 And if you're there next year around the same time, go and either run in the Berlin City Nights event, just go and watch or visit the Irish pub nearby (I heard it was good 🙃👌🏻)

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok 😏).
-
The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes 👏🏻 please 👏🏻
-
We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push 🤨 ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.
-
Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! 😅You cannot win with British people I'm afraid. And Holly is % British, that's a fact.

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (😉), let's talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg 🤩 It's not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip 🏝
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our £ a night hotel room . . . £ you guys!!! 😱 It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)👌🏻
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay 👏🏻
-
🇹🇭 Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you 🙈 They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
🇹🇭 Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point 😆 . . .
-
🇹🇭 The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up 😂 It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great 😅
-
🇹🇭 I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing 🤨 There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country 😍 Please please visit 💚✨

sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about  minutes with stirring every / minutes). that's it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those  minutes just to thicken a  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

i loveeeeee cooking dinner with you guys 🥹 here's some inspo for this week! save this just for the super easy high protein dressing alone— so so versatile! 

loaded veggie & feta green goddess quinoa bowls

details:

- some of the veggies here are roasted and some are steamed (just based my preference for each one). i start with the roasted veggies since these take the most time (zucchini tossed in olive oil and spices, roasted for - min at F. there's also a green veggie burger on this same sheet baked the same way!)
- onto the steamed veggies— i love cauliflower and broccoli steamed more than i do roasted. i steam each one in the microwave with some spices. i do  min and  seconds for the broccoli and  minutes for the cauliflower. i use the green goddess seasoning form trader joe's on these veggies
- while those are roasting, i toss canned artichoke hearts with green goddess seasoning— no need to prep these beyond that!
- next i make my classic hummus dressing with a green goddess twist. i steamed  cup of peas in the microwave for one minute before adding to the blender with a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!
- once the roasted veggies are done assemble your bowl with a greens base of choice, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, artichokes, green goddess dressing, quinoa, and feta of course
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

Doc ID: 7109, distribution: 0.9746836746946652 ; chunkyyyyyy chili on a monday 🥶 chili is a go-to weeknight meal for me. so easy to make ahead and heat up on lazy nights after a long day of work 😴 for this cute lil' bowl i used my weeknight vegan chili recipe (dropping below) but added some big oven roasted carrot chunks to the mix for some fun with texture! i was may more excited for this bowl than i probably should have been lolol. today has been busy but i'm looking forward to winding down with some yoga later tonight! hope you all find a moment of stillness too 🤍

weeknight vegan chili

 chopped onion
 stalks celery, diced
 large carrots, diced
 can pinto beans rinsed and drained
 can black beans rinsed and drained
 can cherry tomatoes 
 cups water
 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
sea salt
garlic powder

sauté the onion in a generous amount of olive oil and sea salt until soft and browned. then add celery and carrots and  cook for another few minutes until browned. add cherry tomatoes, pinto and black beans, balsamic vinegar, spices, and water. bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer, cooking for about  minutes with frequent stirring! if it reduces too much add more water and cook for a few minutes longer. this made three portions for me!

chickpea and eggplant ratatouille:
sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about  minutes with stirring every / minutes). that's it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those  minutes just to thicken spa  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

amin: obsession with body image (reality vs. social media)
Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9718578493998853 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.9681946018147007 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they're human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

This is why I post these “Instagram VS reality” type of posts, because it's one of my most impactful ways to show how curated social media is, why we shouldn't compare ourselves to others & how our bodies can look different ALL THE TIME!

These photos were taken on the same day, minutes apart. On the left, I'm standing tensed & posed or with lighting that softens the dimples on my body making me look like I'd walk around with a toned body every moment of the day… But then, less than  mins later, when I relax, you can see that my body looks almost entirely different. 

Both bodies workout. Both bodies live a balanced lifestyle. Both bodies can wear cute activewear (I'm wearing the new @gymshark Elevate & Camo in all photos - 'BREE' for % off [ad]). Both bodies bloat, wobble & look different in certain angles, poses & times of the day/month/year. 

I used to compare myself & punish my body, striving for a body that doesn't really exist and/or isn't entirely healthy or sustainable for me.

But now I understand that ️⃣ everyone I see online, in the media or even in person might not be how they or their lives look at all times ️⃣ I understand that we are all built differently, with different lifestyles & habits, so we cannot compare ourselves to anyone ️⃣ I can now appreciate ALL bodies & especially my body for what it does for me, instead of the way it looks, and ️⃣ finally, I understand now that having fat on my body, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks, loose skin, belly fat (etc) is so normal, part of being human, not in need of “fixing”, shouldn't discourage me from continuing to do my healthy habits & overall it's part of my happy, sustainable, healthy balance.

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.9661824136453767 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those “less flattering” angles.

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark — it's coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio 😍

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

Doc ID: 2469, distribution: 0.96158101450741 ; ✨ When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change ✨

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

Doc ID: 2374, distribution: 0.9613743621534443 ; The reality of wearing a tight bodycon dress (& being human) 🤷🏻‍♀️

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

🌟 Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
🌟 Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
🌟 LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world 🥹 I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same… Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
🌟 Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
🌟 Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you… 
🌟 If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key 🥰
🌟 At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us 💅 It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible 🫶

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks 💗

Happy Real Me Monday lovelies!

As a teenager, I often compared myself to other women EVERYWHERE I went... Whether it was online or in real life. All I wanted was to have a flat tummy and abs while also having curves, I thought bloating meant I was gaining weight, I researched how to get rid of my cellulite, I thought stretch marks were a flaw & that my skin had to be firm! I thought skinny meant happy... But it did not... Shocker! 🙄 You see, confidence isn't a one-size-fits-all. There are many women who are smaller in size who experience low self-esteem & a negative relationship with their body image. I did too! So this week's real me Monday is focused on showcasing the reality — NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE, you deserve to feel confident & comfortable in your skin. Me being lean & living a healthy lifestyle doesn't mean all of those things I once considered to be flaws would automatically vanish and cease to exist. I lost kgs & I still bloat, my skin still isn't firm, I still have cellulite, rolls when I sit & stretch marks across my thighs. So don't for one second think that being 'thinner' or losing weight is going to help you reach happiness... You have to start embracing yourself NOW! Treat your body with kindness. You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love 🙅🏻‍♀️ REWIRE YOUR MINDSET BOO! 🥰

What is something you're going to make a conscious effort to start embracing? You're in complete control of how you view it! Let me know in the comments below! I'd love to cheer you on 🎉 

P.s. I've got some DELICIOUS new recipes up my sleeve for this week's recipe post to stay tuned 😉

Doc ID: 2612, distribution: 0.9609655478503679 ; Body confidence VS body positivity ⤵️

Happy Real Me Monday!!! Over the past + months of me posting this series, I've received a lot of BEAUTIFUL comments, but I've also received some comments from people who think that because I'm thin, I shouldn't have a voice in this “body image” space… So I wanted to dive into that a little in today's post.

What's the difference?

Body confidence = an individual's acceptance of themselves. When we have body confidence, we accept how we look & appreciate what our bodies can do.

Body positivity = this is about acceptance of MARGINALISED bodies in society no matter their physical weight or size. 

So no, I can't speak for the body positivity movement, but I am all for it! My posts fit into the body confidence category because my body is not marginalised & is considered “socially acceptable”. So, YES I've struggled with my body image, experienced disordered eating, suffered from the pressures of diet culture & picked myself apart because of the way I looked, BUT I've also had the benefits of thin privilege too:
-I don't have people judging me for my food choices
-I don't experience judgement or harassment for my weight
-I am generally assumed to be healthy
-I've always found my size at the store 

For me, I post this series because I'd much rather showcase my body's normalities than portray perfection! I post these photos now because it's what I wish I saw when I was underweight & unhappy. I wish I knew that being thin wasn't going to make me feel confident automatically. I wish I knew that most of the photos I saw online were edited & posed to create a certain shape. I wish I realised sooner that I'm so much more than my appearance.

I hope that by seeing more REAL bodies on your feed, it might relieve the pressure you feel to conform to an impossible beauty standard & allow you to actually ENJOY YOUR LIFE!

Comment with a “🙋‍♀️/🙋‍♂️” if you've ever struggled with your body image! You're not alone, but I hope these weekly posts may encourage you along the way ✨

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.971702257732826 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. “When you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.” T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. “You look like you're about to say something” T commented. “I'm deliberating whether to say it or not” I said, pulling a face. “Go on then, let's just say it”  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said “ok, sooo… it was a blip”. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it.

Usually she asks me “So, where to today?” or something similar. Today I think she said something like “I wanted to ask you a question” or “Can I ask you something?”. Anytime she says something like that, I immediately feel anxious. Something slightly out of the ordinary puts me on high alert. I nodded though that she could ask me, so she said “How do you feel therapy is going?”  She must have seen the look of fear that crossed my face, because she immediately followed up with “That's not a trick question. I'm not expecting any particular answer” and several other reassuring phrases. Then she said that she did have a few thoughts on it herself, but she would tell me them in a minute. I thought she might be referring to what I'd said last week, when I said I felt like therapy was running away with me and I keep not getting round to finishing talking about a subject before something else took over. I repeated those thoughts, and then T started to tell me what she'd obviously been waiting to say but couldn't until she'd done this sort of fake lead-in. It feels fake because I think she was only asking my thoughts so she could then tell me her thoughts. I'm not sure she really listened to my answer. Then she said that she had been thinking about therapy, and about how it was progressing, and where it was going. Very quickly, she added “I'm not talking about us ending, I'm not saying I think we should end. But I know you have brought the subject of ending up once or twice, so I know it's there in the back of your mind too.” I'm looking at her very suspiciously by this point, sitting very still with one hand curled up in front of my mouth.  She continued “When you started therapy, it was like I had to take you by the hand and lead you, like a small child. Then gradually you grew, so it was like we were walking along side by side, like you were a teenager or young adult. And now it feels like you have grown more and you are going ahead of me, and I need to step back and let you lead the way.” She finished speaking and I just sat, frozen, with my hand up over my mouth. I sat like that for what felt like a long time, and T sat in silence with me. Maybe she had asked me my thoughts on it when she'd finished speaking, I can't remember. I'd gone off into freeze mode. My brain heard her talk about endings and growing up and leading the way, and I hate it. I hate it all. I don't want it. I want to just carry on as we are doing. What's wrong with how it is? It's just fine. Just stop saying all this stuff.

As usual, it takes me some time to summon up the courage to say what I want to talk about. T sits patiently and waits. She won't rescue me anymore, she knows I get there in the end. Even after I told her what I wanted to talk about, I struggled to find where to begin. I think of ways to start, and then another part of my brain shoots them down. On reflection, that likely stems from my childhood. My dad had no patience for a story that wasn't thought through, or that rambled and didn't make sense. And all possible weaknesses had to be defendable. It means I overthink and freeze often when I'm trying to tell something. T gave me a way in by helping me get started, and then I was able to tell her the whole saga. I was really only telling it in order to talk about my texting dilemma afterwards, but it was actually good to explain at all. T was really encouraging and said I had done a good job even though it had cost me a lot emotionally. She started doing her psychodynamic thing, looking for links back to my childhood, but I said actually I really wanted to talk about something else and that was just the background. She smiled and said “Ok… and well done for interrupting me!” I told her about how I had a dilemma about texting her. I'm stuck between thinking that sooner or later I wouldn't be in therapy anymore and so she wouldn't be there for me to text her and so I should just learn to get on and cope with it on my own. And thinking that sooner or later she wouldn't be there and so I should make the most of it while she is there and (I got tied in knots here and ended up just reading out what I'd written which was “Make the most of it while she is there and it's ok to want to text her and I don't need to withhold it from myself”. I explained that withholding things from myself was an eating disorder behaviour, when the ed voice would tell me I could survive without x y or z and therefore I clearly didn't need to have it and must prove that I could manage without it. T said that she was absolutely happy for me to text her when I need to because she knows that I don't do it for just anything and only when I really need to. “I'm giving you something…. you're getting something from me. Some nourishment.”  Well that went a bit weird and therapisty 😳. I looked at her. She carried on, “One day you won't need to get it from me. You will be able to get it from people around you.” There was a long pause while I considered this. Eventually T said “You look like you're wrestling with some sort of dilemma?” I said “Yeah…. I'm just thinking…. that I did message H and my friends too, so I was trying to reach out to my real life supports too. But its like…. if a child falls over in the playground then their friends all try and make them feel better, and that's nice… but what they really want is an adult to come and look after them.” “Yesss…. that's to do with emotional regulation. When your feelings overwhelm you, you need someone more emotionally regulated to take your overwhelming feelings and digest them and give them back to you in pieces you can handle. That's what you didn't really get as a child, that regulation of your feelings. So you haven't had that experience and that's why it's difficult for you to do it for yourself now. That's why you sometimes need me to do it for you. But you are learning to do it for yourself, it's just a slow process. It doesn't happen fast. But that's ok.” I do think in some areas I am getting better at it. Like in fostering, sometimes something happens that makes me really mad or upset, and I used to always go to my manager and wail about it and she would speak to whoever and resolve it. But now I'm starting to think hang on, I can do something about this myself without having to run and get an “adult” to fix it for me. I'm learning to regulate myself more. Then T tried to do some grounding for the last few minutes and asked me a question about d, which I did answer but my brain was still on what we'd been talking about. So I said what I was thinking about… and then we were out of time.

Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.957035810233445 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 0.9559882977271422 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said “”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.” I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

Doc ID: 17232, distribution: 0.9550975202471543 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me “Do you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?”. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be “No”, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do.

Doc ID: 14578, distribution: 0.9538135780668987 ; Therapy .. // stressy and messy  I was in such an anxious wailing mess for this session that I can't remember much of exactly what was said. I wailed about the neighbour and the water under the house situation. T tried to give relate and gave a practical suggestion from her experience about the water, which I appreciate where she was coming from but it wasn't helpful because I already have the neighbour telling me one thing, the builder telling me something else and H wanting to bury his head in the sand and hope it'll all go away. T adding in another suggestion just stressed me right out, so every time she went there I cried and said I don't want to talk about what to do about it, it's too stressful. When the neighbour was talking to me, I went into fight or flight mode and then I couldn't think straight and as a result I forgot to tell him relevant things that would have supported the points I was making to him. “I'm also upset because I thought I was getting better at handling stress and now I'm just here all a mess and feeling like I'm free-falling, as bad as ever.” I don't know if anyone reading this can relate, it's not just stress about the situation. It's like my whole brain goes off-line and can't get a grip on anything to ground itself. There's nothing to contain the anxiety. I know there's a thing called “toxic stress” which children experience when they experience stress that they can't regulate and have no adult around to regulate it for them. In children toxic stress actually causes structural changes in their developing brains. I suspect I had some toxic stress as a child. My attachment figures were the source of some of it, which meant there was nowhere to go for regulation. Maybe that explains why my brain is so hopeless at handling confrontations We talked about previous situations that have been similar and not similar, and what's made them like that. T pointed out that the last situation that stressed me that I handled well involved my peers, whereas this situation with the neighbour is a throwback to interactions with my dad. “Different situations need different coping strategies”, she pointed out. We went right over time and I didn't even notice. T looked at the clock and said that we needed to end. I think she'd lost track a bit too, because usually she starts dropping “it's time to finish” hints with about  minutes to go. We scheduled for next week and then just before we clicked off, she said it would be good to start with how the conversation this session has felt. “It would be good to reflect on whether it's helped to talk about it, or whether it's just 'muddied the waters'. I'm going to make a note right here in my diary - 'reflect' - to remind me.”

Doc ID: 15470, distribution: 0.9536022281622669 ; Therapy .. // rupture time again  My therapist and I had a bit of a rupture last session. We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow.

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

Maybe you're tired of scrolling seeing other people doing the thing you want to do

Maybe you're tired of feeling like you'll never get to do the things you want because of your situation

The difference between you right now & the people you strive to be like, or your dream vision “you” is that…

You're still in your comfort zone.

You've let the small things keep you here, rather than throw them right back and move forward with your beautiful gentle power.

Getting to a new, more exciting place requires stepping out and trusting yourself. 

I've coached women through leaving their job, starting a new venture, finally taking the trainings they have been too scared to take, traveling the world for their heart's sake, and actually pausing everything to do the RESTING that their bodies have craved.

So here's to trusting yourself, trusting yourself to get up, brush yourself off, and to keep moving.

My -month coaching program, Flourish with Purpose is where women who feel stuck and unfulfilled in their job/path come to: 

🔥reignite their flame 
🌏learn how they can uniquely make an impact on the world
⭐️gain confidence & support to pursue their dreams
💅🏼live life on their own terms

I'm only taking a few clients at a time.

“I'm so lost I don't know my next steps are😩”

“I know something needs to change but I don't know what!!” 

“I'm so unhappy with where I am 😭”

Doc ID: 8721, distribution: 0.9104656287896624 ; if you have been feeling stuck, start with figuring out these three things (completely free exercises!): 

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

Doc ID: 8718, distribution: 0.908074696953204 ; of all the fears i had in changing my direction, the fear of other peoples reactions was the biggest block 

in my people pleasing past, i learned how to control the reactions of other people so that i could be in their favor by doing what ~i thought~ would make them happy

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others? 

in the most loving way i can say this- people don't care like you think they do. 

do the thing, make the jump, hire the person, make the change 

your best and highest version is waiting for you 😇🦋

Doc ID: 2552, distribution: 0.9075992427122435 ; It's hard to love yourself if you never spend time with yourself. Alone time is necessary 🌱

And by alone time, I don't mean scrolling through social media or watching a TV show, I mean making the time to be present, soak up your life & do what brings you joy.

Welcome to my th ✨SOLO DATE DIARY✨ entry 📖 

To me, romanticising your life isn't looking for the perfect moments in your life, it's about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little mundane moments. Being present in the ups & downs. It's about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I, myself, am extremely guilty of this… But I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Before dating myself, I had no idea I could be confident enough to go to an arcade on my own, dine in alone, sit by myself & get lost in a book with the hustle & bustle of life all around me.

I had no idea I could be alone without feeling lonely.

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It's necessary. It's empowering. I'm sure we've all heard the saying “you can't pour from an empty cup” & it's true. I urge you to prioritise yourself… FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

What kind of things fill your cup??? ☕️ I'd love to hear it, no matter how exciting or mundane it is!! It might give someone else some ideas for ways they can fill theirs as they scroll through💡
