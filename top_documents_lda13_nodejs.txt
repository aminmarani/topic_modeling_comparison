Doc ID: 6826, distribution: 0.9934125253788129 ; if you know me at all, you know bowls like these are basically my entire personality 🫡long time followers will remember my loaded veg bowls from college! 

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

Doc ID: 6845, distribution: 0.9926162767965252 ; my favorite fall savory meal. so versatile, can be served hot or cold, and packs so much flavor 🍂

fall harvest kale salad

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
-  apples of choice, diced (i used envy apples)
-  can of chickpeas (oz), rinsed and drained
- / cup vegan feta cheese

maple djion vinaigrette:

-  tbsp dijon mustard
- - tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup      
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the vinaigrette over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

tofu and veggie sandwich

-  slices of toasted sourdough
- vegan cream cheese
- hummus
- oven baked tofu slices 
- roasted red peppers
- massaged kale

pretty self-explanatory! spread the spreads on each slice of bread, layer the tofu and peppers, top with the kale, press the two halves together and slice!

oven baked tofu details:

slice tofu block into squares and place in a bowl. cover with:

-  tbsp coconut aminos
-  tbsp rice vinegar
- garlic powder
- sea salt

toss until well coated and let sit for a few minutes to marinate. then transfer to a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake at F for  minutes or until golden brown.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9942357368472601 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15104, distribution: 0.9929910045108479 ; Therapy .. // Part two // just be on my side!!  T asked me some questions about how my  year old self felt about moving up two years at school, but I didn't really feel safe to answer her. My  year old self does not feel T is fully on her side. T seems to often go back to defending my parents or justifying their decision, or sometimes even just being too rational about the whole situation and it just makes me want to cry pitifully and say “why can't you just be on my side?” So I couldn't jump into further discussion with T without laying that out on the table. It took me some minutes to build up the courage to say anything… my brain gets carried away working out what to say. Eventually I took the plunge and said “Can I ask you something?” Of course T said yes. So I said, “Can we… you…. just presume - when I'm talking about this stuff - that I don't need you to defend or justify my parents? That I've got all that stuff on full volume in my head anyway and I don't need you to say it.” T said “Yes. So what have I said today that defends your parents?” That didn't feel defensive on her part, more curious as to how I experience what she says. “No, not today, nothing today, but you did last week. And I just… it took so long to get past me believing they were perfect and that it was me that was the problem…. and now I'm trying to see that not so good side as well but it seems like whenever I say anything negative about them, you're always defending them.” T said “OK, I think it would be helpful if you told me immediately, if you felt like I was defending them. Then we could speak about it.” I nodded. She continued “You did think they were perfect for a long while - I still remember our very first session, when you told me 'oh no, there's nothing wrong with my childhood, there's nothing to talk about there' - and I heard that as a warning from you. A sort of 'don't even go there' message. So I needed to let you find your own way to your conclusions and not put my thoughts on to you. If I'd told you some of what I was feeling, it would have pushed you back into defending them again. But now I think you've got there, you are more realistic about them. You know they weren't perfect and I'm trying to help you get to a more balanced view, without tipping too far over into anger at them.” “But maybe I just need to do that…. to go the other way for a bit… before coming back to a balanced view” “Yes” T said thoughtfully, “I was just thinking that. Maybe you do need to be angry at them for a while.” “It really feels like, whenever I say anything negative, then you try and be rational about it and then you leave me on my own with how I'm feeling. And I just want you to be on my side!” 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16376, distribution: 0.9893130526524888 ; I texted T that quote I posted yesterday and said omg it's me. She replied “yes, it is you… but you're learning that your feelings are valid now” I first came across the quote as I was looking something else up in the book, and it really reminded me of how things were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet looking calm on the outside. That is definitely a thing I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It's strange to think it's not normal actually. Doesn't everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone's brain works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else's. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that's probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I've never really spoken about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was “quite avoidant” when it came up in conversation over something, but that's about it. Of course it's been referred to in the context of my responses to other things, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever therapists do when they figure out the theory of what's going on with their clients. I think it's perhaps something to talk about a bit more next session, 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14998, distribution: 0.9886098840349711 ; Question: How do you deal with talking about your mom and how she wasn't a great mother in therapy? I know you wrote about this before but my last session some very obvious abusive things my mom did came up and Idk how to go about talking about it especially without dissociating by time the session ends. It's so vulnerable to talk about and explore and the feelings are so conflicting and I just don't want to talk about it but I know I have to. I'd also really like to not shut down  Answer: We've approached the subject very slowly over weeks and weeks, just hinting at it or saying one or two little things, so that gradually I've been able to stay present with it. I think you have to be able to trust your therapist that they won't push you too far each session (while also being able to push you just enough at times).We've also taken the last - minutes of the session to “unwind” (that's what T calls it) but basically to ground and get back to the present, which has worked really well for me. Remember that you don't have to talk about it all at once in one go. You can just talk about one small part of it, dip in and then move on to talk about something else. For me it's felt really important to feel like T is on my side with this, before I've been able to be fully vulnerable with how I felt about my mum. So that's been gradually building up over recent session as well, me saying things and watching for her response, I'm quite hypervigilant anyway to how others are responding to me.I hope you find a way to talk about it with your therapist when you're ready! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16185, distribution: 0.9880873394923801 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15372, distribution: 0.9870305664251412 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15470, distribution: 0.9863674299664767 ; Therapy .. // rupture time again  My therapist and I had a bit of a rupture last session. We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14490, distribution: 0.9858612545976837 ; Therapy .. // slowly unfreezing  I sat frozen for some time. It probably wasn't very long but I lost any sense of time. I was not making eye contact with T but I was facing the screen enough that I could see her when she shifted position. I become very aware of my own blinking when I'm frozen like this, I guess my eyelids are the only part of me that moves. It's not going to be a very accurate account of what happened from here on because it's a bit hazy and I'm piecing it together from snatches of memory. T may or may not have asked me what I was thinking, but eventually I managed to rouse out of my frozen state enough to say “My mind is all blank”. T said “Mmm yes, you're having a freeze response, like in fight flight or freeze. Would you agree?” I nodded.  “Some part of you feels like it's not safe, what I just said?” she continued. I nodded again. Once I've moved out of the totally involuntary freeze state, it's hard to force myself to unfreeze further. Most of my brain wants to stay there, it doesn't want to make the effort to come back to the present. I have to really work to make myself focus and speak.  I don't know what got said in what order after this. T said if you keep someone dependent on you when it's not needed, then that's abuse, not comfort. I'm not sure why she said that, other than she's trying to tell me I need to be less dependent. Except I think I *am* less dependent than I have been, so I don't get it. And I'm not going to stop depending on her entirely because I'm paying her to be my therapist and I'm not going to turn down her support while it's still there. I don't want to look back when she's not my therapist any more and wish I'd made full use of her support when I had it. T mentioned that I had brought up ending therapy before, and so she knew I had thought about it. I dredged some words out of the back of my brain and muttered “I don't actually want to end therapy after all….. I'm just going to stay forever and ever.”  T said “That's very brave of you to say that. Thankyou for being brave enough to say that.” I flickered my eyes over to make eye contact and then looked away again. T said “There might be a bit of a problem with staying in therapy forever with our ages, as we both get older.” I felt like I didn't care about that. I don't have a solution to it but I don't need a solution right now. Right now I am here in therapy and that's where I'm staying.

Doc ID: 14425, distribution: 0.9858086388963588 ; Therapy .. // I still hate starting  I think I could be in therapy for  years and still not be good at starting a session. This session I looked around the room blankly and eventually pulled a helpless face at T, and she just raised her eyebrows back at me and smiled in a kind of carefully equally-helpless “yes, this is a dilemma isn't it?” I sighed and looked at my short page of notes and said “I'm trying to decide what order to say things in”. This is just a variation on things I say to try and get started. “Hmm ok. Well, you could start with the most difficult to get it out of the way, or you could build up to it and do it last but we might run out of time…” This is also just a variation on things T says in response to me trying to get started. I wish I could be someone who just sits down and start splurging their innermost thoughts. I seem to need  or  minutes for the emotional pressure to build up enough to get me speaking. I don't know whether there's any way to bypass this. I might bring it up next session. If nothing else, it will be a different way to start 🤷‍♀️ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15367, distribution: 0.9852020808476315 ; Therapy .. // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or…, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. “Maybe there's not a Perfect cake” said T, “Maybe there's just a Good Enough cake.” That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I'm in a 'which cake' dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don't want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I'm away (benefits of online therapy y'all).

Doc ID: 8812, distribution: 0.9877123161649901 ; The biggest fear holding most people back from living their truest lives is people JUDGING them…⁠
⁠
While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.
⁠
Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ⇣⁠
✨ the  year old version of you ⁠
✨ the  year old version of you
✨ people who are curious about the things you are but don't have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
✨ people who your message will inspire and change
⁠
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

Doc ID: 8712, distribution: 0.9870916447831132 ; hint: you don't actually need to HAVE all the things or truly be confident and clear on your forward motion for this to work!

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

Doc ID: 8642, distribution: 0.9860334329261604 ; I used to think it was soooo much more complex than this… but really it can be as simple as DECIDING that this life you want is possible for you.

You don't need to know how.

You don't need to know the exact steps right now.

The first step is to have some mental flexibility to say “yes i believe there are possibilities for this life i have been dreaming of”

“Yes, the resources and the support I need to get there exist somewhere in the world.”

“Yes, I think if i really applied myself to it, i could do it.”

Once you do this, 

Once you have DECIDED that you might be able to attain your desires (which are actually going to help the world),

It will start to unfold because it's meant to. 

Don't just take my word for it…. Try it for yourself and watch what happens.

And prepare yourself for that dream life to start making it's way to you.

You got this. I love you.

Being a highly sensitive person (HSP) doesn't have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨

i used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!

Some (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:

🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.

🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.

👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner world and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.

👀🔎Ability to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! 

😻Appreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.

⚖️Strong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the world.

😌💭Deep self-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and self-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.

being a highly sensitive person can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make their “sensitivity” their STRENGTH 💪🏽 in living their most aligned life.

- expecting to be paid from their purpose 

- making sure everyone is happy with your life shifts

- not wanting to make a wrong choice… so you don't make any at all and perpetuate feeling stuck

- thinking that your sensitivity and empathy is a WEAKNESS, so you hide it and don't explore what it can actually do for you.

- forcing a path because it “seems” right, not because you truly FEEL in your body that it is the right move.

details for these vegan twix bars below! the date caramel recipe alone makes this post worth saving… you'll want to eat it by the spoonful.

vegan twix bars

crust:

- / cup oats
-  cup soaked raw cashews (i did / cashews and / dry roasted peanuts)
-  tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil 
-  tbsp maple syrup 

date caramel layer: 
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter (can also use creamy salted almond butter)
-  tbsp maple syrup 
- - medium soft dates, pitted
- splash of vanilla
- sea salt
- cinnamon

chocolate layer: 
-  chocolate bar of choice, chopped
-  tbsp peanut butter 

directions:

add all of the crust ingredients in a blender and blender until uniform. transger to a brownie pan (i used a small tupperware) and form into a solid layer. place in the fridge to set for five minutes. while that's setting, make the date caramel layer by adding all of those ingredients to the blender (rinsed after making the crust) and blend until smooth/uniform. you may need to add more water in  tbsp increments to get the blender moving, especially if it's not a super high power one! transfer the caramel onto the crust layer and place back in the fridge to set for a few minutes. melt the chocolate and peanut butter (i use the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between). once smooth, pour over the caramel, spread evenly, and place in the fridge for set for at least  hours. remove, let thaw for a few minutes, slice, and store in the fridge!

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

this is not saying that being thin or losing weight is bad! but the phrase “nothing tastes better than skinny feels” encourages and romanticizes disordered eating, and trying to reach or maintain a weight that is below where your body wants you to be (which is different for everyone) feels like crap. you might be cold a lot, isolate yourself from loved ones, have a hard time concentrating, be consumed by thoughts of food, and sacrifice your health- mentally and physically.

gaining weight and undergoing body changes is hard, but that doesn't mean it's bad, wrong, or unhealthy.  you deserve to live a full life and enjoy food without constantly worrying about how it's going to affect how you look…

if you gain weight from fixing your relationship with food, eating enough to satisfy you, and enjoying foods you love, then you were supposed to gain weight.

Doc ID: 9744, distribution: 0.9855334192587142 ; opposite action is something that when i committed to recovery and trying to rewire my brain, REALLY helped me combat my negative thoughts and stop labeling my actions.

essentially, opposite action means deliberately doing the opposite of your harmful emotional urge.

if i had the urge to run, i would choose to get closer.

if i had the urge to isolate myself, i would choose to reach out to someone.

if i had a thought telling me that i “shouldn't” eat the chocolate cupcake, even if i didn't know if i really wanted to eat it, i would choose to eat the cupcake anyway with the goal of taking away the power from the food and transferring the power back to myself by making the decision.

this helped me eventually change the thought process from thinking i “should” or “shouldn't” do something to thinking about if i do or don't WANT to do something.

initially, opposite action can feel really scary because it's literally going completely against what your thoughts want, but that's why it works. the more and more you do things that feel scary, the less scary they become, and the more you're able to actually tune into how you really feel and make the choice you really want.

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.9660847511358313 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

but, food is also just food.

it's okay if you eat past fullness sometimes. it's okay if you ate something that made you gassy and bloated. it's okay if you eat something that doesn't satisfy you. it's okay if your eating isn't your idea of “perfect”.

there are so many valid reasons to eat other than “for fuel”including not having a clear reason at all. food doesn't have to have so much power over you, and there are SO many more important things in life to focus on and experience because at the end of the day, food is just food, and each individual food choice you make doesn't need to be so complicated.

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.9807022065768035 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those “less flattering” angles.

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark — it's coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio 😍

But this just goes to show that no matter how flawless we may look online, that's just not the reality most of the time. Our lumps, bumps and rolls are normal and nothing to be ashamed of ⭐️

Just like us…🪞 

So while you might not look exactly like the beauty you see in your friends or the people you follow online, that doesn't take away from the unique beauty that YOU ARE. Like the examples above, just because you appreciate one, doesn't mean you can't appreciate the other. Despite what we've been brought up to believe, there's not just one type of “beautiful”.

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that today could be the day you decide to kickstart your health journey to reach your “body goals” after a weekend of simply ✨ ENJOYING YO LIFE ✨ and there's nothing wrong with working on your goals, but I'll just leave this here every Monday to remind you that a woman who works out regularly, eats well & lives a healthy lifestyle can have belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks & doesn't always look as toned & fit as she may appear online. So next time you question your self-worth when comparing yourself to someone you idolise online, remember these weekly posts are here to bring you back to reality 💗

The more we see people with normal bodies, the more realistic our expectations will be & then hopefully more of us will start to accept ourselves too 💛

If I saw other women with realistic, relatable, healthy & normal features in magazines growing up, it would've caused my confidence to: 📈 instead of: 📉

Instead, we see the photoshopped versions of the people we look up to, and when we do see someone with similar features to us, it's plastered all over the front page with derogatory headlines (swipe across to see what I mean 😓)

 in  women struggle with their body image… Are you one of them? If you are, leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments & if you're not, leave a “🥰”.

We're quite literally brought up to believe the body we're born in needs to be fixed & scared into new short-term, unsustainable diet fads each week instead of being inspired to be our healthiest & happiest selves long-term.

Now, I know I can't possibly represent everyone because we all have different body types & live different lifestyles, but I guarantee that if we were educated on how normal (& common) these features are & saw diverse bodies of all sizes, shapes, colours, disabilities, etc being represented & accepted, I think the amount of women & men who struggle with their body image would be so much lower. 

Can you just imagine how the -year-old version of yourself would've felt if Britney Spears was on the front cover, cellulite & all, EXCEPT with a positive, uplifting headline about how happy she looks, rather than tearing down the PERFECTLY NORMAL cellulite on her legs? (Swipe across to see the cover I'm talking about 👉🏻)

The more we see it, the more we normalise it… So while the reality may not be embraced in magazines, you can still choose what you consume online. So curate your feed carefully! Opt in for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse 🌟

Would love to hear your thoughts 💭 

Have a stellar day my beautiful friends! Chat with you in the comments xoxo 🍿🤍✨

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human — there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

This isn't ONLY directed at female bodies… ALL bodies are different 💫

Did you notice it at first??? Would you have been able to tell that the first half of this video was not my real body? Leave a '😳' if you didn't notice the photoshop & a '😑' if you did notice it!!

What's frightening is that this is happening everywhere... In Instagram photos, in magazines, even in videos — and often by people we look up to 😅 so please be careful with what you consume online, if someone's content makes you feel worse, you have the power to “unfollow” — PRESERVE YOUR ENERGY & always remember that what you see online isn't always real. You're wonderful as you are 💛

Credit to @victoriagarrick who shed a light on video editing yesterday in her Tiktok video, it's a scary world out there folks & these apps are only setting us up for failure. How can we accept the person we see in the mirror when every voice we've grown up around has told us to conform, shrink, be less this and more of that? Happiness isn't a size or physique, happiness grows from within xo

The reason I decided to post something like this is because I remember growing up, seeing so many images of celebrities in magazines with bloated tummies, cellulite, breakouts, etc & the media would blast their photos all over the cover tearing them apart with headlines about how they've let themselves go, how they're having a meltdown & place them among the “ worst beach bodies” — it's toxic! So if your body has those lumps, bumps, cellulite, rolls, stretch marks, saggy or loose skin, “flab”, texture & pigmentation — you're not automatically a failure or ghastly beast that needs fixing boo, you're just like the rest of us = HUMAN ✨

Doc ID: 2392, distribution: 0.9455048400749662 ; You will never ✨actually✨ see your own body. You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Or a “perfect” version of yourself. Or anyone else for that matter. You are exactly where you are supposed to be, right now.

Take note of the REAL smile in the first slide here 🥲 in the past I would've believed the better photo is the one my body looks more toned & “Insta-worthy” in, but now I realise we're all worthy of being seen no matter what, and the best photos are the ones we're just being our comfortable, happy selves in.

You know, I used to allow the way I viewed my body to dictate how much I should or shouldn't eat, or what I should or shouldn't wear.

I felt bad for bloating.

I felt bad that my body changed & expanded after eating or drinking.

I wouldn't wear a fitted dress if my body did expand throughout the day.

I'd change into something baggy if my tummy wasn't flat or if my cellulite was too noticeable.

When I used to go out, I was too busy worrying about the way I looked or how others perceived me to enjoy myself & actually LIVE in that moment. 

WHY??? Why do we do this to ourselves?
 
We're not supposed to be perfect (whatever “perfect” is).

Plus, everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to criticise you! 🙈 

So… This week I challenge you to fuel your body & still wear that cute dress or those shorts or whatever outfit it is that you've been too afraid to wear — and just ROCK IT!! 🥳 

This weekly series is here to remind you not to compare your life or your body to someone on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with yourself as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that.

Happy Real Me Monday! ☀️ Swipe to the th slide for some super candid pics from my camera roll! 😂 Which number are you today? I'm a bit of  & a bit of  HAHA! Leave yours below👇

Thank you Spain for creating some of the best memories ever . . . as you can tell, I'm very much still 'living' in the clouds 🙈🫶🏻

Whether it's a fully vegan restaurant, quirky cafe or chain restaurant, being vegan is definitely something that isn't so abnormal or alien these days 🙌🏻 Times are honestly changing people 👏🏻 I've tried a fair share of places, but there are still many more I need to visit. One of the blog posts on my website will be dedicated to finding vegan food when out and about, and if you guys have any other video/blog post requests, definitely tell me in the comments down below👇🏻
