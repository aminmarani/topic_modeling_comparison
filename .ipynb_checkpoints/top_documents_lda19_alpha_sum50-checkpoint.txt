 It is okay to be angry at the world. To be angry at everything that is happening right now. To feel frustrated and lost. To be mad at yourself. Right now it might seem like everything is just getting worse and worse with all that is going on. And it can be so scary, I know. I just want you to know that all of your feelings right now are absolutely valid. You are allowed to feel angry, frustrated, lost or mad - and everything at the same time. I know there is hardly anything anyone can say that will make all of this more bearable, but I just want you to know that I am cheering you on. Even if you do not believe it, this will pass and you will be okay.

Doc ID: 9537, distribution: 0.954748534763539 ; it's hard to feel good about yourself when somebody is mean to you all the time. don't forget that you are somebody too. 

you know how someone can tell you that you're smart, amazing, and beautiful  times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn't really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you're incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't share about my hard days too. i've mentioned that i've been struggling a bit lately, and if i'm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.

if you need to hear it: you don't need to be your ‚Äúbest self‚Äù to be worthy and lovable. you are, have always been, and will always be enough.

the ones whose days have gone from
bad to worse,
the ones who feel like they lost everything
and don't know what to do next,
~keep going~
because things change, time heals,
and forgiveness towards others and yourself can grow in the toughest times.
~keep going~

Doc ID: 9702, distribution: 0.9470410899358401 ; self-love doesn't mean that you always feel good about yourself.

self-love is recognizing and affirming yourself for who you really are.

self-love is accepting yourself however you show up on any given day.

self-love is honoring yourself and your body even when you don't feel good.

self-love is being honest with yourself about where you're at and what is really best for you.

self-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.

self-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.

self-love is knowing that your worth doesn't change even when you do.

self-love is freedom, and being free is the best feeling in the world.

while i don't believe in manifestation in the sense that if you imagine something to be true, it magically will be, i do believe that positive mindset, thoughts, and emotions can be so incredibly powerful.  you can't always control everything that's going to happen in life, but you can control your responses, your reactions, and your thoughts, and when you realize that, you realize you control your life, and your choices determine your fate

the past few months, my mental health has been rocky, and it's honestly been really tough. i catch myself telling myself that once i feel better or things change, THEN life will be so much better and i'll be happier. something i'm constantly reminding myself of is that in the midst of struggle, there can still be space for happiness. i don't need to wait until i'm feeling better or in an easier stage of life to still seek out joy. i can want to change AND accept my current state. i can feel sad AND experience happiness. i can be healing AND be whole. duality exists, and it's a beautiful thing.

so, bloom where you are planted. if you are struggling to see the light, don't be afraid to be the light. you are exactly where you are meant to be, and beautiful things are on their way. after all, without rain, there would be no rainbows üå∑‚òÄÔ∏èüåà

. talk about your feelings, no matter how hard they may be. you're not crazy & you're not alone.‚Å£
. you deserve more than being thrown around like a toy. stand up for yourself.‚Å£
. use your voice. don't let anyone silence it.‚Å£
. trust the process. things will work out, even when it seems like it is the end.‚Å£
. love yourself & believe in yourself first.‚Å£
. you are loved and cared for. you do matter, even when you feel like you don't.‚Å£
. you have the choice to make a change in your life. don't be afraid.‚Å£
. allow yourself to take a break.‚Å£
. this is your story. you know yourself. you know the truth.‚Å£
. tell your loved ones how much you love and appreciate them while you have the chance.‚Å£
. you're not the problem. you deserve better than someone who can't understand you and strings you along.‚Å£
. as hard as it is to let people go, you have to do it. you have to accept that people aren't who they painted themselves out to be.‚Å£
. let yourself be happy and don't let anyone take that away from you.‚Å£
. you are so brave for taking the hardest step and reaching out for help.‚Å£
. feel what you feel. it's okay to be sad. it's okay to be anxious. it's okay to not be okay.‚Å£
. give yourself more credit for all that you've accomplished.‚Å£
. stop worrying so much about the future. focus on the present. focus on yourself.‚Å£
. hold onto hope. you are resilient. keep on fighting.‚Å£
. it's okay if the only thing you did this year was survive. please choose to stay." - @ashlekhram

- chopped arugula 

toss everything together and then add in the vegan basil pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

toss everything together and then add in the basil pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It's from their new Eclipse collection & I've been living in it üòç [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it üëèüèª

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! ü•≥

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know üíõ

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! üòç | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Wearing @baseline's new Seamless collection üòç absolutely adore these pieces & the gorgeous ribbed fabric!! You can get % off too with the code BREE - orders over $ get free shipping! ü•≥

I hope this series of 'what IG sees VS what IG doesn't' photos reminds you why you shouldn't compare yourself to people online! It's not fair on us to compare our natural, normal, everyday selves to the perfected, posed & edited versions of people online... We only see % of someone's life here on IG, so it's unfair to compare our % to someone else's highlighted % ü§Ø

When I first started this series I still worried that someone might see these photos of me and think, ‚ÄúOh, she's not as pretty as I thought‚Äù but then I realised it LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER! That doesn't change or determine who I am, what path I'm on and how I make others feel ‚Äî unless I let it. Being more accepting of yourself is a choice, CHOOSE to be kinder to yourself! ü§™ Anyway... All I hope for is that my Instagram can be a home for you to find comfort, confidence, acceptance, motivation & positivity. So I'll just keep posting these every Monday as a friendly reminder as we enter a new week. I hope yours is amazing! ü•∞

Doc ID: 2634, distribution: 0.7847982138895291 ; Happy Real Me Monday my friends... But with ‚ú® a special lil twist ‚ú® 

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram ‚Äî swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) ü¶ã 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

üå∏ people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC üå∏

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

‚ù§Ô∏è your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
ü•ô your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? üí™üèº 
ü¶† half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? ü•∫
üß¨ while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .‚Äù, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible ü§Ø

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way üíõ 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Doc ID: 2639, distribution: 0.7821453927698984 ; Happy ‚ú® INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY ‚ú® & real me Monday, where for the last  weeks in a row I've attempted to make Mondays a lil more enjoyable by sharing some ‚ÄúInsta-worthy‚Äù photos beside the REAL version of myself, the version I now prefer to share online! ü§ó

I used to post only my very best photos, and there's nothing wrong with posting photos you feel good in. But there was something wrong with the way I didn't feel good unless I looked 'perfect'. There was something wrong with the way that I wanted to impress other people to the detriment of my mental & physical health. There was something wrong with the way that I couldn't accept my body, the bloating, the rolls, the bulges, my cellulite, the way my body slouched & relaxed when I was completely comfortable. 

Honestly, beauty standards have changed SO much over the years. They're always changing, and we're always trying to shrink ourselves to fit them. So let's create our own beauty standards & make them as diverse as possible ü•∞

Beauty, to me, is a smile ‚Äî because it has the power to make another person smile, and their smile can make someone else smile, and so on until YOUR smile has created a hundred more without you even knowing your impact. Beauty is kindness. It is not a shape, height, style, race, weight, hair type, body type, or external physical trait. It's a mentality, it's subjective, it's something that comes from within, and... it also ISN'T EVERYTHING!

What is beauty to you? Lmk in the comments ü§î

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.778800354612237 ; REALITY CHECK‚ùóÔ∏èThis is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years‚Ä¶ 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a ‚Äúhealthy & fit‚Äù body would automatically be ‚Äúflawless‚Äù & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either‚Ä¶ ü´¢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places‚Ä¶ Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
üçë still have a small bootay
‚ö°Ô∏èhave cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
ü§∞üèª still have a lower belly bump
üí™ not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
üòÆ‚Äçüí® not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
üçïbe flexible with eating
üí§ rest
üï∫üèºhave a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's ‚Äúideal body‚Äù, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right.

Doc ID: 4125, distribution: 0.9566229041581065 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. ‚ÄúAvoidant attachment‚Ä¶. yes, yes I see that in you‚Ä¶‚Äù. She carries on reading. ‚ÄúHmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents‚Ä¶. How did it feel to read that?‚Äù I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof‚Ä¶ not that I think you were making it up‚Ä¶. but that you weren't just being nice‚Ä¶ like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said ‚Äúok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!‚Äù. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3115, distribution: 0.9566030612072043 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said ‚ÄúI can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?‚Äù I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  ‚ÄúOk, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?‚Äù I nodded. T continued, ‚ÄúSo it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?‚Äù I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said ‚ÄúIt depends how brutally honest you want me to be?‚Ä¶. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!‚Ä¶‚Äù My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúnot normal‚Äù when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 4795, distribution: 0.9546350701990834 ; Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says ‚ÄúWhere to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about‚Ä¶. what we were talking about last week?‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like I'm in a gap between those two things‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, well‚Ä¶. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?‚Äù I nod. T flips a page in front of her. ‚ÄúYou said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?‚Äù That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says ‚ÄúSo you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?‚Äù ‚ÄúNoooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm and did you feel that I felt like that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.‚Äù We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? ‚ÄúNo, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think‚Ä¶ I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit‚Ä¶ *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.‚Äù I hadn't ‚Äústopped eating‚Äù, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4452, distribution: 0.9521106483710818 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said ‚ÄúOk Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.‚Äù We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said ‚ÄúSo tell me about [something].‚Äù I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2966, distribution: 0.9511920009117363 ; We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said ‚ÄúI think I need to talk about something else now‚Äù which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I'm not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. ‚ÄúShall I ask you some questions then?‚Äù she said, and I nodded. She carried on ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ ok‚Ä¶ children‚Ä¶ holidays‚Ä¶ the baby‚Ä¶ what shall we go with?‚Ä¶ oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I've hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there‚Ä¶. So, what's happening with her future?‚Äù I started telling T about the plans for the baby's future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by  minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I've had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we've talked about, but this week I don't seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it's a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4821, distribution: 0.9467977712258459 ; Me: *sits in silence* My therapist: have you got things going round in your mind, or has it gone blank? Me: yes I've got things going round, I just don't know if I want to say them My therapist: You don't want to say them because?‚Ä¶ you've got something else you want to talk about? Or because they're not very comfortable to talk about? Me: yeah they're not very comfortable to talk about and I'm just not sure if I want to go there My therapist: They sound like exactly the things we need to talk about then Me: ugh 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2394, distribution: 0.9459948266957727 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. ‚ÄúThis week's been a bit difficult‚Ä¶. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about‚Ä¶ uh, things I'd been holding all week‚Ä¶ and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.‚Äù I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong ü§îü§Ø hence‚Ä¶. the therapist is always right?? 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 3805, distribution: 0.9418059111774684 ; Therapy .. // a snippet  We were towards the end of therapy today and T was on a roll, talking talking talking about anger. Sometimes she gets like this, she says lots of really good and potentially helpful stuff but sometimes she gets carried away and misses the fact that I'm not quite with her. I was still processing something she'd said just previously which I was quite impacted by, and there she was going on and on about something that felt quite irrelevant. Eventually I burst out in frustration ‚ÄúCan you stop talking for a minute!‚Äù T stopped talking immediately and said ‚Äúmm of course‚Äù. Then she said ‚ÄúWell done for telling me to stop‚Ä¶. I'm glad you could say that to me‚Ä¶..‚Äù (Sorry T sorry that was rude, thankyou for taking it so well) I was so shocked that I'd just cut her off like that. T probably thinks of it as progress. I sat in stunned silence for some minutes after, trying to get control of myself and cope with what I'd just said and also think about she'd said immediately before all of that, that had rather knocked my feet from under me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2322, distribution: 0.9373473159511538 ; In therapy last session, we got to the last few minutes and I realised that I hadn't talked about something that I had intended to. I had a moment where I fell silent and dithered over whether to try and cram it into the last two minutes or to leave it till next week. I couldn't decide, and then completely spontaneously I put my hand on my chest and said ‚ÄúI feel all panicky just now because I had something else to say and I can't decide whether to try and say it now or not.‚Äù T was really calm about it and gave me the choice of saying it now so it was said and then coming back to it next week, or keeping it for next week. I decided to keep it for next week, but what I really noticed afterwards was that I had actually had a feeling IN SESSION and was able to feel it and name it. Usually I only get the feelings afterwards or realise that I felt them afterwards. This feels like progress and I feel encouraged! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 5172, distribution: 0.9361119537262813 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me ‚ÄúDo you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?‚Äù. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do.

While the EXACT reason is unknown it could be due to ground shift, a volcanic dike of some weaker mineral that solidified there before everything was exhumed, an old pressure crack or it could be due to an old (minor) fault line.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake‚Äî hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract‚Ä®
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in‚Ä®‚Ä®
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave‚Äî all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend

- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.
