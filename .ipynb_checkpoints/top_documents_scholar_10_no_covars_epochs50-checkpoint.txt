Doc ID: 13094, distribution: 0.9928669929504395 ; Empty: A Memoir by Susan Burton
 
 So I just finished this incredible book, and I have a lot of thoughts to dump out about it.   It's different from other binge eating books that I've read in that it does not focus on recovery—Burton is upfront about that, and it's basically in the title (it's a memoir, not a guide or explanation). And, a good chunk of it is about her restrictive eating phases before and after her bingeing phase. But it really, really resonated. It's kind of incredible how experiences that you think are unique to you, are in fact common experiences.  Even if this book didn't provide a clear path forward for myself, it made me feel less alone. To quote Burton, who also dove into books about eating disorders while in the midst of her own: “I wasn't interested in the end, the part where she came out okay. I wanted to stay in the part where she was wrecked. I wanted to feel less alone, because isolation had become the primary consequence of what I did, separating myself from the regular people who lived in the regular way” (Burton ). Burton voiced thoughts that I didn't know I had until I read them, and she articulated feelings I've struggled with. Here are some quotes that I felt in my soul, in case they help anyone else: Describing bingeing as “a way to temporarily shut everything out and exist in an altered reality defined by the loosening of restraint. But bingeing deadened feeling and was incompatible with human connection” (Burton ). Later describing binge eating as “a 'short-term escape from an aversive awareness of self'” (Burton ).  I had never conceived of bingeing in that way in particular, but when I read it, it felt right. In the moments of bingeing, it's almost freeing—I'm in a different world where it doesn't matter what I eat, I'm just free to eat and exist and nothing else matters aside from that freedom. But it's not a “freedom” to actively avoid reality and everything it brings. It's caging, it's isolating, and it prevents living my life. I'm actively avoiding existing as myself—my mind, my body, my life feels too uncomfortable (even if that discomfort might just be the uncomfortable “urges to binge” that Kathryn Hanson describes in Brain Over Binge) and I turn to bingeing.  Describing her mother calling out her anger: “My anger had been talked about before. And, yes, I had plenty of it, but it was all at myself. I was angry at myself for all the wrong ways I was. I wouldn't be angry if I were better! If I could just fix myself, this would all end” (Burton ).  God, the anger and self-loathing is so real. On days I binge, or even think about the consequences of previous binges, I just feel like absolute shit, and I'm teetering on the edge of lashing out at everyone around me. But part of me wants to scream that I'm not angry at them, I'm angry at me. And I've convinced myself I just need to “fix myself” and stop bingeing, and then I'll be the perfect bubbly person I want to me. Is this true? Probably not.  “Ten minutes was enough to ruin everything. How was it that in such a small unit of time you could make an entire day into a total wreck?” (Burton ).  Simply put, this quote was just relatable. It feels impossible some days to ever be a “normal eater” when an entire day can be ruined with ten minutes of bingeing. I know that black-and-white thinking is a problem that needs to be addressed, and days can't truly be “ruined,” but it was refreshing to see this account written by someone else—a professional! a writer! a perfectionist, over-achiever like me!—who felt the same way I do.  “Other girls just had their bodies and put food into them and didn't think. Or they did think but in a normal way. I could tell by the way they said it: 'I am getting so fat.' They weren't wrecked by food in the way I was; it didn't define them” (Burton ).
  I felt this one so strongly. Even when I was mostly “recovered” in college, I still envied the girls who could talk about their food or bodies without feeling deeply uncomfortable or shameful in the way that eating disorders mess up your cognitive associations. And I know that's unfair of me; I never know what other people are going through, including with food, and Burton addresses her own experiences with having to challenge her preconceived notions of others and her own self-centered perception of eating disorders. It adds to the guilty and shame, I think—to hate yourself, and to project that anger onto others who seem more “normal,” and then to hate yourself even more for doing so.  “My eating had worsened in distinct stages. Beginning each new level, I'd felt horror that this is the worst it's ever been. Now the worst felt medical. There were times I ate so much food I worried something bad could happen to my body. A line had been crossed: The fear of the harm I was doing was now worse than the humiliation of continuing to expand” (Burton ).
  So much about this book had me yelling internally, “This is me! This is me!”. I can point to specific times when it felt like I'd crossed a bingeing threshold. For example, I would previously never eat at night—not because I was actively avoiding eating at night, but just because it had never really occurred to me to do so, and I didn't have the desire to. Until I did once during a binge, and suddenly it became a new norm. The number of time's I've said to myself, “This is the worst it's been…” Yikes. And Burton specifically discussing the medical fears—I have felt genuinely afraid of the damage I was doing, of the heart palpitations and the stomach discomfort and the severe bloating. I'd imagine how embarrassing it would be to die from bingeing so hard that my stomach bursts, and I get so anxious about the possibility. B.E.D is truly horrible.  Discussing how the life milestone of leaving for college couldn't even feel like an important milestone because of the bingeing: “I could not even contemplate what I felt about leaving home. The only exit I cared about was from the eating. Until I left that, nothing else would matter” (Burton ).  Bingeing takes over your life. I feel like I cannot live fully, I cannot do anything, until I get my eating under control. It just fills my mind constantly: thoughts of food, eating, weight, body, meals. Nothing else seems to matter, and nothing else can matter, until I clear some of the mental space that is currently taken up by bingeing.  Reflecting on her post-binge rituals of writing and setting new never-again goals each time: “It was the first moment I realized that I was getting something from this. That I liked something about this. I liked the possibility inherent in the act. I liked getting as low as you could and then every day the moment of begin-again. I liked the calm that followed an episode. Something quieted, the need met. Ah, yes, here I am in the place where I make resolutions and start afresh” (Burton ). “And it was true that I would miss the cycle of destruction and renewal, so regular that it was circadian” (Burton ).  This really caused me to reflect on my own “destruction and renewal” cycles. It's true—after a binge, there's something ridiculously empowering about setting new goals and resolutions and feeling convinced that it will never happen again because in that moment, it truly feels like a fresh start and a new beginning. Is that part of what keeps the habit engrained? That part of me thrives on the fleeting sense of control, even though I am never able to follow through with those resolutions? Some of my most productive moments have been post-binge, once I get past the self-loathing stage and move on to the resolution, future-oriented stage. I had just never before considered this to be an inherent part of the bingeing cycle…  Describing her constant food thoughts as a sound engineering metaphor: “The eating stuff was a track that ran in my brain under all the other tracks. Sometimes it would get so loud that it would drown out all the other tracks; sometimes I could lower the volume, but I was never able to remove the track from the session. Deleting the track was the wrong idea, [my therapist] said; lowering the volume was good, but the main thing was to boost the other tracks. Boost the other tracks. Develop other strengths and ways to cope; raise the signal on all I'd neglected” (Burton ).  I absolutely loved this metaphor. Food takes up so much of my brain energy and thoughts, and I have been so desperate to clear up that space for other things. But if I find ways to focus on other strengths and cope with life in new ways, the space will clear itself to make room for the new focuses. It's kind of intuitive, so it's not particularly new information, but I wanted to print out this quote and wallpaper my room in it. It gives me hope.

Doc ID: 9562, distribution: 0.9901959300041199 ; i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they're meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

Doc ID: 2612, distribution: 0.9790046215057373 ; Body confidence VS body positivity ⤵️

Happy Real Me Monday!!! Over the past + months of me posting this series, I've received a lot of BEAUTIFUL comments, but I've also received some comments from people who think that because I'm thin, I shouldn't have a voice in this “body image” space… So I wanted to dive into that a little in today's post.

What's the difference?

Body confidence = an individual's acceptance of themselves. When we have body confidence, we accept how we look & appreciate what our bodies can do.

Body positivity = this is about acceptance of MARGINALISED bodies in society no matter their physical weight or size. 

So no, I can't speak for the body positivity movement, but I am all for it! My posts fit into the body confidence category because my body is not marginalised & is considered “socially acceptable”. So, YES I've struggled with my body image, experienced disordered eating, suffered from the pressures of diet culture & picked myself apart because of the way I looked, BUT I've also had the benefits of thin privilege too:
-I don't have people judging me for my food choices
-I don't experience judgement or harassment for my weight
-I am generally assumed to be healthy
-I've always found my size at the store 

For me, I post this series because I'd much rather showcase my body's normalities than portray perfection! I post these photos now because it's what I wish I saw when I was underweight & unhappy. I wish I knew that being thin wasn't going to make me feel confident automatically. I wish I knew that most of the photos I saw online were edited & posed to create a certain shape. I wish I realised sooner that I'm so much more than my appearance.

I hope that by seeing more REAL bodies on your feed, it might relieve the pressure you feel to conform to an impossible beauty standard & allow you to actually ENJOY YOUR LIFE!

Comment with a “🙋‍♀️/🙋‍♂️” if you've ever struggled with your body image! You're not alone, but I hope these weekly posts may encourage you along the way ✨

Doc ID: 9550, distribution: 0.9786185026168823 ; you don't need to justify your weight gain to anyone (including yourself), and the only thing weight gain really means is that you've gained weight. that's it.

weight gain doesn't mean you need to change how you eat.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less beautiful.

weight gain doesn't mean you've “lost yourself”.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less healthy.

weight gain doesn't mean you can't still rock your favorite outfit.

weight gain doesn't mean you should be less confident.

weight gain doesn't mean you're any less worthy.

weight gain doesn't mean ANYTHING about the wonderful human you are.

weight gain really doesn't have any inherent meaning, and it's important to remember that our bodies are MEANT to change throughout the course of our lives. even if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, your actions, how you feel, and your quality of life matter a whole lot more than your weight does.

recently, i've gained weight, and you know what? i'm cool with that. i know it can feel a lot easier to know and be told than to truly believe, but you deserve to love yourself and accept yourself no matter how your body changes.

your body is the vessel to your soul. it WILL change, but your worth never will. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2618, distribution: 0.9772675037384033 ; What's your motivation? To be fit & healthy? But at what cost?

Do you feel like you're punishing your body or nourishing it? 🤔 I'll leave the characteristics of a 'punish my body' VS 'nourish my body' mindset below:

Punishing:
🙅🏻‍♀️Eliminating entire food groups
🙅🏻‍♀️Rules around when you can eat
🙅🏻‍♀️Can't miss a workout 
🙅🏻‍♀️Not eating when you're hungry 
🙅🏻‍♀️Negative body checking
🙅🏻‍♀️Only feeling good if you've stuck to a strict routine & anything outside of that is a failure
🙅🏻‍♀️You measure success via how sore your body is & how hungry you are
🙅🏻‍♀️Your inner monologue tells you you NEED to “do more exercise” or “eat less”
🙅🏻‍♀️You get anxious around birthdays, Christmas & Easter
🙅🏻‍♀️You feel like you have to “earn” your meals
🙅🏻‍♀️Bloating makes you feel awful about yourself
& so on 

Nourishing:
✔️Giving into your cravings
✔️Working out in ways you enjoy
✔️Being flexible with your eating & exercise habits
✔️Skipping a workout when you don't feel physically or mentally up for it
✔️You forgive yourself for any negative thoughts & try your best to be kinder to yourself 
✔️Food is essential, not only for health but for enjoyment too, whether you workout or not 
✔️Weight fluctuations are expected & accepted
✔️You don't check the scales regularly or associate what you weigh with your worth 
✔️You're okay with your body changing/bloating throughout the day
✔️You prioritise your mental well-being just as much as your physical health
& so on

Which one sounds like you? Maybe you're a bit of both... But what kind of mentality do you want to work towards? Let's do that!! 😍💪🏼

The crazy thing is, a lot of us feel like we have to punish ourselves in order to reach our health goals, but this mentality is actually counter-productive. You'll find it much easier, more sustainable & realistic to reach your health goals with a 'nourish my body' approach 🥰

Here are some photos I took when I had a 'punish your body' mentality beside me now — same poses, just a whole new perspective & outlook on health & happiness 🌸

Doc ID: 2644, distribution: 0.9767118692398071 ; Wait… What do you do AFTER weight loss? What *actually* happens when you eat more? How do you maintain it and increase your food intake???? “I'M SCARED I'LL GAIN IT BACK”

These are all questions I had in the photo on the left after I'd lost kgs. And I'm not gonna lie, with increasing my food intake, I did regain a few kilos back, some in the form of muscle & some in the form of fat, but that's not something to be feared or afraid of. I now eat more than ever before & maintain my weight! I couldn't have done that without working my metabolism back to this point. It made me realise that my 'goal weight' wasn't a certain body shape, it was whatever weight I reached by actually LIVING & prioritising my health!

So yeah, I gained a few kilos, but swipe across to see what else I gained! <

✨ NOURISH YOUR BODY ✨
FOOD is your body's fuel. It needs it to survive. Food itself won't cause you to lose or gain weight, it's your overall intake VS output that will.

✨ PRACTISE FLEXIBILITY ✨
This is important on ANY health journey. Whether you want to lose weight, maintain your weight, gain weight… Practise flexibility. My body burns roughly  cals a day, but some days I'll eat  cals, other days I'll eat . Just listen to your body's cues and fuel it with delicious & nutritious food. That's balance bby, it all balances out in the end! 

✨ LIVE YOUR LIFE ✨
Weight fluctuations don't mean you're losing control or going backwards… They're an indication that you're LIVING YOUR LIFE. Last year was my first year of maintaining my weight… And what that *ACTUALLY* looked like was my body weight going up & down by about kgs all-year round… My weight may have fluctuated slightly, but my overall confidence, happiness, health & sanity DID NOT!

Anyway, more can be found on my YT or IG! I hope this helped in some way! If so, let me know by leaving a lil '💪🏼' in the comments below! 😘

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9747519493103027 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

Doc ID: 9921, distribution: 0.9740263223648071 ;  weeks into my all in journey, and this is where i'm at:
- my hunger levels are definitely lower, and i've now been eating ~- calories a day. i have fluctuations, but the consistent weight gain seems to have stopped, which means i'm reaching or around my set point
- MOST days are good or neutral body image days, and i think i've gotten pretty good at having ~body neutrality~. i still have bad body image days sometimes, but i've realized that bad body image is usually a response to other stuff in my life going on and isn't really a response to how my body actually looks even when it feels like it, so i'm able to dismiss the negative thoughts pretty quickly
- i have been averaging one structured workout a week for pretty much this entire weight gain journey so far because of other things. this has probably been the hardest on me mentally because it took me years to build the amount muscle and strength i had. i'm proud of how far i've come with my relationship with exercise though and know that it's okay for body comp to change in different stages of life
- i didn't realize until this morning how big of a win it was for me that i haven't had a binge eating episode (if you didn't know, i struggled with binge eating disorder for  years), since i started this all in journey
——
i share where i'm at right now, not so you can compare your journey to mine, but so that if you're on a similar journey as i am or have been, you can maybe feel less alone or have hope. this is my second weight gain journey since choosing recovery and isn't a response to healing disordered eating (i've been fully recovered for ~ months now), so this process has looked wayyy different than when i gained weight immediately post-restriction.  i say this because i know some of you are gaining weight, and i don't want you to misinterpret that committing to eating in excess and weight gain while healing from disordered eating is easy because it isn't. it was the hardest thing i've probably ever done. but, it is WORTH IT, you CAN do it, and eventually you WILL get to a place where food doesn't consume your mind, numbers don't affect how you view yourself, and you are TOTALLY free

Jumping on this trend because I resonated so much with it & thought maybe y'all would too…

Body image is a person's thoughts, feelings & perception of the aesthetics or attractiveness of their body. It's not *actually* about your body, it's about the way you speak to & think of yourself. 

At my lowest weight I still wasn't happy… Look at that face 🥺 I was so focused on looking as lean as possible at all costs that I'd completely overlooked what that state of leanness had actually cost me… I'd forgotten how important LIVING MY LIFE was. I had bad body image days more often than good ones because I was always striving to be “more this” and “less that”. 

Those extra few kilos I've gained in the photo on the right is the freedom to snack out on sleepovers with my besties, to order what I want from the menu, to not weigh and track everything I eat, to not push myself to extremes in a workout, to enjoy my life to the fullest! It's the freedom to accept my body changing & see myself as a whole person, instead of one body part or flaw.

🚨 Disclaimer: this isn't supposed to be a comparison of my body type but rather my mindset now compared to then. It's just that the left photo was taken at a time when I was hard on myself & couldn't find peace with my body. My body image is much better now, not because of my body, but because I'm nourishing my mind with more forgiving, accepting, positive thoughts 🌱🚨

Which do you experience more often? Leave a “🥰” in the comments if you experience more positive body image days & a “😅” if you experience more negative body image days. I'll be replying with some personalised affirmations for y'all because YOU ARE AMAZING!!! Chat with you in the comments 🌈

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that Mondays are renowned for being a fresh start, the day to kickstart your goals & make drastic changes… So I'm just leaving this here as a reminder that:

🌟 You can prioritise your health & still eat your fav burger
🌟 You can enjoy a weekend of eating freely with friends without punishing yourself today
🌟 You can love working out & still enjoy rest days
🌟 You can have bad body image days & still love, respect & appreciate your body
🌟 You can have cellulite, fat on your body, stretch marks while still being the fittest & healthiest you've ever been
🌟 You can have both, it's not all or nothing.

I started my health & fitness journey close to  years ago now. 
This body lifts weights  x a week 💪🏼
I eat nourishing foods 🥙
I get plenty of rest  💤
I drink plenty of water 🧉
I live a balanced lifestyle 🍩

I do this not to punish my body, but to nourish it. It makes me feel good. 

So why is it that when we picture “healthy” or “fit”, we picture the version on the left, but not the right? Why is cellulite, tummy fat, stretch marks, etc something we seek to “fix” through food, exercise & lifestyle changes? Why do we set ourselves an expectation to look a certain way & fit a very specific beauty standard when our lifestyles, our history, our genetics & our body compositions are all different? 

The truth is, “healthy” is going to look different on everyone. And yes, for most of us, that includes cellulite, rolls, lumps, bumps & marks.

That's not something that needs fixing, changing or hiding! That's just human 🌻

Doc ID: 14433, distribution: 0.9985217452049255 ; Ahh we have had such a lovely th wedding anniversary day.  We called by a local deli and picked up a sandwich each for lunch and a chocolate chip shortbread each too, and then headed out to our nearby countryside (staying local of course). Then we went on a  mile walk, which was slightly unintentionally longer than I planned because it was SO misty today that we couldn't see more than about  metres in front of us, and as a result I took us off on the wrong path at one point. Anyway, it wasn't a problem and it felt so good to get out together. We sat on a rock just over halfway and ate our sandwiches, for about  minutes till it got too cold to sit and we had to finish our sandwiches while walking. When we finally got home about pm, we had a pre-dinner drink from a new bottle of my favourite gin ever (see above) and opened our cards. d cooked us the most delicious evening meal (menu as above - all my favourites!) and in between the starter and the main course, we had to have a break to face time with d who is away at uni. It turned out that d had made us a video by messaging loads of our friends and getting them to send her video messages for us. It was absolutely fabulous! My sister and her family did their message popping up and down behind their sofa saying one word at a time each and it was so funny and went wrong so many times, that H and I were propping each other up laughing. Another of our friends made a whole message themed around board games which was so clever. I just got so emotional that so many people would take time to make us a message - and they kept so quiet about it and pretended to be all surprised if I ever mentioned to them it was our anniversary coming up! After watching the video, we finished our meal (and a bottle of Prosecco) and then chilled on the sofa with after dinner coffee watching the final episode of one of our Netflix binges. It's been a such a wonderful and memorable day ❤️

Doc ID: 15148, distribution: 0.9943768382072449 ; Thank you all you lovely people for all the birthday wishes. I had a lovely day, starting with a  mile run to set me up for the day. Then I went out for lunch with  of my friends. We went to a little Italian cafe and I had an Italian ciabatta followed by a slice of ricotta and pistachio cake. Some of us were very decadent and shared a bottle of wine. What a treat for lunchtime! I came home and when d and d came home from school I opened my cards and presents.   In the evening we went out again for a family dinner to a nice pub. I had fish and chips, and then later a slice of this birthday cake d had made for dessert. We called in at our friends on the way home and had a drink and played a board game before heading home just before midnight. Very content. It was such a lovely day. Now to get on with being .

We went up yesterday for a  hour visit, taking the baby but leaving d and d here to fend for themselves - the first time we've ever left any of our children home alone overnight!  I cooked a big lasagne and took it with us for dinner last night - cooking lasagne from scratch is a real labour of love. We played games, sat in the hot tub, explored the forest, ate birthday cake, and this morning went swimming and then ordered takeaway lunch from the cafe. It was a lovely break and so much fun to have some grown up time and do something a bit different in the middle of a week. Oh, and I ate a pain au chocolat for the first time in years! Not my breakfast of choice but yay me for going with the flow and not making some excuse.

Doc ID: 16443, distribution: 0.9901686906814575 ; Yesterday was Boxing Day. I went for a short run in the morning before the rain came, and in the afternoon we met up with my sister and family and went for our traditional Boxing Day walk up a local hill. It was cold and wet but good to get out for fresh air. After that we sat in front of the fire and watched a family movie, ate turkey curry for tea and played board games in the evening. d and d were coming down with colds or maybe even in d case the flu 😷 so they took themselves to bed for early nights. Today my mum and I have mostly been starting and doing our pc Christmas jigsaw. Hoping to finish it before we leave. I made baked Camembert and potato wedges for lunch while my mum went for a run. I'm saving my legs for parkrun tomorrow. We went round to my sister's this afternoon and the kids all had a chocolate fountain while my sister, my mum and I planned my mum's party for her big birthday next year. Now we're back at my parents, drinking gin and working on the jigsaw.  Being at my parents has difficult moments but so many lovely moments that the difficult moments feel worth it. This is maybe the first year though that I've properly acknowledged, even to myself, that it's not all lovely.  Tomorrow is parkrun and then we may head home in the evening, or maybe the next day. Currently undecided. It might depend on when we finish the jigsaw…

Beautiful madness. We visited my in-laws and saw our niece for the first time since she was walking. I went all the way to the Shetland Islands for a weekend to run the most northerly park run in the UK. More madness. While we were up there I saw puffins for the first time. Amazing. The baby and I went on a mini-retreat to the seaside and I had a bit of a breakthrough thinking about therapy things. I went away with H for two nights and we stayed in a cow-themed room. The baby and I had a lovely day out to a country house and saw penguins. My sister had a festival in her garden for my BIL's big birthday and we all went up for the weekend. My mum and I did one of the most scenic parkruns in the UK along the shore of the lake. My teenagers had birthdays, grew up, didn't want to have days out, didn't tell me when they would be home, stayed up all night on their gadgets, slept in till midday, and did all the other things teenagers are supposed to do in the summer holidays which drive their parents mad. I ❤️ them. The baby and I had a daytrip to meet up with @raspberryrose and her baby, which was fab. A sudden heavy rain shower put a rapid end to our picnic but then it passed and we spend the afternoon pram pushing in glorious sunshine. I tag @raspberryrose , @eattodefeat and @productivetimewasting if you want to join in.

Doc ID: 15968, distribution: 0.9862104058265686 ; Lockdown Day   These lockdown days seem to get so full up of stuff that I barely have time to get on tumblr, which is sad because it makes me feel disconnected from all my tumblr friends. Eating has been somewhat better today, although after doing PE with Joe (and d, d and d), I went for a run (my one allowed daily outing for exercise). It was the penultimate run of my half marathon training schedule, a tempo run with  minutes warm up jog then  minutes at fast pace and  minutes cool down jog. My legs were dead, I don't think Joe's PE was a good pre-run idea. For the first time ever in the entire training schedule I skipped the optional extra part of the run, so I only did  minutes fast. Then walked home for the cool down. I didn't eat enough yesterday and I exercised too energetically this morning and it came back to bite me at pm when I crashed out on the sofa. So none of that was great.  On the positive side, the weather was so sunny and warm today, I started to wonder if I should have worn suncream for my run. It's been beautiful and we've been sitting out in the garden enjoying it. I want to write about therapy - last week and this week. I'm hoping I'll have time to do that tomorrow. I am in need of a peaceful day just pottering around rather than frantically trying to do jobs and take phone calls in between the baby's schedule and trying to keep on top of everything as much as I can for the girls. In other news, we got Disney+ yesterday and everyone is very happy. I'm not really bothered about watching it (no time haha) but I'm happy that everyone else is happy. Since the gym is shut, we get a rebate of our gym membership which will more than cover the Disney+ cost so that was our justification. Plus we need things to do in these lockdown times. Of course our daily appointment with Boris at pm. He wanted to be remembered for Getting Brexit Done, and instead he'll be remembered for Getting Us Through The Coronavirus Pandemic. I don't like him and his party and policies but I do think he's doing a pretty good job overall of this. And Chris Whitty and the other guy (Prof someone) will be up for knighthoods when this is all over I'm sure. This evening we had a Zoom with our church group and that was lovely to see everyone and give thanks for the good things in our lives and pray for each other's needs. Very encouraging. I'm heading for bed very soon now so I'll say goodnight. Stay safe and healthy everyone if you can x

Doc ID: 15766, distribution: 0.9859386086463928 ; Question: Do you drink tea? Or just coffee? How do you take either? Do you drink multiple cups throughout the day or just in the morning? What's your favorite coffee shop order? Answer: When H and I first got married, we drank tea all the time. We had a running joke that in the evening one of us would make a pot of tea, and then we'd leave it to brew and invariably forget about it and then an hour later we'd be like, did we ever pour that tea? (Maybe you had to be there lol)Then at some point in life (I think it was after three pregnancies in which I completely went off both tea and coffee and that acted a bit like a reset) I switched to coffee. So I do like tea but I rarely drink it now. I take both tea and coffee with just a splash of milk. I drink coffee fairly continually through the day, but it's instant coffee not “proper” coffee. After pm I switch to decaf. If I go to a coffee shop (maybe once or twice a week), I order an americano. I can only drink one coffee shop coffee, if I have two I get the caffeine jitters and it feels horrible!

Doc ID: 14294, distribution: 0.9858389496803284 ; Question: Dumb question is tea what we would call dinner in the us or do you still eat dinner in addition to tea and tea is more of a snack? Answer: Haha I get asked this quite often on here. Yes tea is what you would call dinner. I say tea when it's a casual meal probably about pm and dinner if we were having friends for a meal and eating later like pm (back when we could do that!). Sometimes we say Sunday dinner or school dinners, and then dinner refers to a hot meal at lunchtime. When I was growing up we called our evening meal supper, although my local friends called supper a snack you had before bed. So there you are, totally confusing! At least breakfast is the same name everywhere.

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 0.9894994497299194 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 14593, distribution: 0.9891138076782227 ; Therapy .. // ending therapy thoughts  We had  minutes left after we'd spoken about the girls and their health kick and I asked T if we could talk about something else. I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  “Oh yes, I remember” T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . “I genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?” That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the “time to end therapy” is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said “uh I don't have much time left”. T said “Does it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?” and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9872254729270935 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 15173, distribution: 0.9868078827857971 ; Therapy .. // I was telling you the FACTS! // a messy session  T must have read my face and my hesitation when she asked me about how brutally honest I wanted her to be, because she said “Ok, how about I ask you a question instead?” She asked me what I would have done, if I were my parents making a decision about their child moving ahead school years. I said that I might have gone with the first year but not the second year. That led into me giving a long explanation of the circumstances around me moving ahead two years and the decision-making that I think went on around it.  T asked me if there'd been talk of me taking a Gap year after sixth form before I went to university, and I said it had been mentioned but that there wasn't anything exciting that you could do at age  in a Gap year then because for most stuff you had to be  or over for their insurance policies. I wondered out loud whether my parents should have pushed more for me to take a Gap year or whether I should have had the insight to think that it might not be best for me to go to university so young, or was it reasonable for me to just follow the system. What if my parents had said no, I needed to stay at home for another year. “They could have had me at home for two more years than they did! If they'd wanted me there, they could have had me there.” It's a thought I don't think I've ever put into words out loud before. “Ohhhh… hmm… is that what this is all about?” T asked.  I was temporarily shocked by what I just said, so I said “Uh, is what what it's all about?” T said “Well, you've just spent  minutes defending your parents and their decisions, and now you're saying they could have had you at home longer.” All I heard was the first part of that. It felt like all our attunement fell away in an instant and T “dropped” me, emotionally-speaking. I don't know what T observed looking at me, but I felt a big shift happen inside me. “I don't think I was defending my parents!” I exclaimed. I pulled away, as much as you can over Skype, from our connection. T said “ok but you were explaining why they made the decisions they did…” “I was telling you the FACTS!” I fired back. T said something else, which I can't remember. I think she asked me another question. I ignored her question and said grumpily, “I'm all confused, because now it feels like we've been talking at cross-purposes all this time” I was telling T the story of moving up two academic years, which is a story I have told hundreds of times in my life, and she thinks I was defending my parents. I got overwhelmed by all the feelings suddenly swirling up in me, and T sitting in front of me trying to keep the conversation going, and I did something which I haven't done in therapy for years . I flopped over sideways off-screen and hid my face on my legs, so T couldn't see me anymore. Then I just did some breathing and tried to see my way forward out of the swirling emotions. T waited a bit and then started talking. I've no idea what she said. I peeked round eventually and I was surprised to see her still on the screen. I don't know why I was surprised.  I told myself that I don't want to use the rest of the session hiding off screen, and I don't want to have to end while we are still in this mess, so I need to sit back up and have the conversation. I did manage to sit up and be back on screen again, although I kept my legs drawn up in front of me in a defensive way. “Are you angry with me?” T asked. I glanced at her and told her “yes”. “Ok… we don't really have time to talk about it anymore today… it's time to end… so do you want to unwind for five minutes? - or do you just want to leave it there?” I paused while I had a bit of an internal battle between wanting to just walk away and wanting to have a little bit of connection so I don't have to carry this feeling with me all week. “I just want to leave it there, but I'll probably feel worse if I do.” “Ok” T said, and started making some chat about d. It was hard to push through and respond to her questions, but I did mutter a couple of answers, and T tried hard to empathise and remind me of my strengths and say some positive things. It seems very strange that I can be angry with someone, and also at the same time manage to have a normal(ish) conversation with them. Looking back, I do appreciate that even while she knew I was angry with her, T also didn't want to leave me in that place all week but tried to rebuild a bit of our connection and positive feeling in the few minutes we had left.  We ended with scheduling and then we both said “bye” and I clicked off. Usually I say thankyou as well but I wasn't feeling it this week so I didn't.

Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.9820020198822021 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 16855, distribution: 0.9817459583282471 ; Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says “Where to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about…. what we were talking about last week?” “I feel like I'm in a gap between those two things” “Ok, well…. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?” I nod. T flips a page in front of her. “You said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?” That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says “So you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?” “Uh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.” “Did you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?” “Noooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.” “Hmm and did you feel that I felt like that?” “Well nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.” We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? “No, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think… I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit… *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.” I hadn't “stopped eating”, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached.

Doc ID: 14933, distribution: 0.9816548824310303 ; Question: Hi Faith, I've been following your blog for a long time now and was hoping for some advice from you or your followers. I know about how your therapy journey started but do you have any advice for anyone starting therapy? After years & years of wondering, I'm now starting therapy next week. I don't have an ED and I kind of feel like I don't "need" therapy but I also don't really know how to feel happy & can't remember the last time I did. But I don't know whether a therapist could help with that. Answer: Ah I think a therapist could definitely help with that! Well done you for being brave and taking the plunge to work on something that you want to be different in your life. I would have also said I didn't “need” therapy when I started. Because I was keeping myself alive day to day and wasn't that what really counted? But you don't need to be on the verge of insanity before you can go to therapy. Wanting to improve your life in any way related to your mental wellbeing is a good enough reason to go to therapy.I am never sure how helpful it is to give advice about starting therapy, because I think every therapist is slightly different and going in with too much advice given beforehand means you already have expectations about how it should go. I don't know what sort of person you are, whether you find it easy to speak about how you're feeling or not. I also have a whole load of words now to describe my inner world that I didn't have any concept for when I started therapy, so I could suggest from my 'enlightened position' that you say this or that, and you might look at me like I'm talking a foreign language. I think just turn up and try and be as straight up as you can. Tell the therapist why you've come for therapy, and let them take it from there. For me, because I'm quite avoidant and reticent in therapy, sometimes I try and pretend that I'm someone who doesn't mind talking about these things, who doesn't get tied in knots over it. Because I truly believe there are people out there who are like that. So I try and pretend I'm one of them and that can help me just get on and say stuff without overthinking it to the nth degree. A bit like, Fake it till you Make it, although I'm not encouraging you to be fake in therapy, it's just brain tricks I try and use to help myself talk! Best wishes for your first therapy session, I hope it goes well and you click with your therapist. (Remember you can shop around for a different therapist if you find after a few sessions that they're not the one for you) xx

She asked which bit of it I wanted to talk about. I said I wasn't sure if I really felt like talking about any of it right now. T suggested we try and push through that feeling, unless I wanted to talk about a different topic.  “I think… we were looking at this list last session before the break… and I'd forgotten - completely forgotten till we came to talk of scheduling right at the end - that I wouldn't see you the next week… and then I was all in the middle of stuff on the list but suddenly I wasn't going to see you…” “Yes, it all felt a bit raw?” T asked “Yes, it was all left hanging. And I'd forgotten I wasn't going to see you last week, because I'd been too distracted about you being unexpectedly away during the week before and whether you were going to be back in time for my session. It was like I'd been looking back and I forgot to look forward…” I don't really know whether T got what it felt like for me when she unexpectedly went away. Or maybe she did get it, but she had forgotten about the little exchange we had about it. Which is maybe understandable because maybe it was a family emergency and she has been caught up in dealing with it and has understandably forgotten some of the details of what went on with my therapy before hand. I still felt like she wasn't entirely on the ball this session.  We looked again at the list and I started talking about how ideally I would like to be able to share emotional stuff with H in the moment, without feeling lazy, guilty or demanding. As it is, I either only tell him when the crisis is all resolved and everything is neatly wrapped up, or when I have a massive meltdown to the point of not being able to function.  “When I'm all emotionally stressed out, in order to be able to share it with H, I need even more emotional energy. But if I'm all maxed out, I don't have any more emotional energy to use. So I just keep it to myself.” We talked about it for a bit but I can't remember now what we said. I think we might have run out of time at that point. T lightened up the conversation for a bit of grounding before we finished. I got talking about a fostering course I am doing and we ended up going about  minutes over time, but only on chitchat not therapy (maybe that's not so bad?) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15833, distribution: 0.9801827669143677 ; Therapy .. // good end bad end  Then the second thing that rocked my world a bit was I'd talked about the controlling mind end being similar to my mum and the “good end”, and the greedy needy body end being similar to my dad and the “bad end”. I said I try and stay as close to my mum's end as possible, my mind in control of my body as much as possible. T looked at me and said “What if both ends are bad though?” I had a sudden feeling of intense panic/terror. If both ends are bad, where can I go? Where is safe? If this end is bad, what am I doing here? How do I know where in the huge expanse of middle is the right place to be? The floor has just fallen out from under me. It all felt very huge and real in the moment. T started talking about anger and how expressing not enough anger and too much anger are both bad and she was going on and on and on. I told her it wasn't really about anger but she said she was just using it as an example and carried on talking. I just let it wash past me while my thoughts whirled round and round in my head. She talked and talked and eventually I felt like my head was going to explode till I couldn't stand it any longer and burst out “Can you stop talking for a minute!” I'm sure she's supposed to be tracking me and seeing if I'm with her…. although I'll grant it was a bit hard on the iPad as she can't see where I'm looking with accuracy. Anyway, she had totally lost me and gone of on her own tangent. But when I asked her to stop talking, she did straight away. She said “Yes of course” then she said “Well done for telling me to stop talking” and “I'm glad you could say that to me”. I sat with my face turned away and my hand up in front of it for a while, taking some deep breaths and just trying to calm down a bit. Eventually T asked me what was going on for me right now? I said I was just thinking if both ends of the line were bad, then I thought I was safe but I'm not, and how do I know where to go? T said “It seems like your world has just shifted in a major way…”  I was a bit zoned out and sat mostly in silence for a few minutes, then T said “We have gone way over time, but I know this is a challenging place to end… I'm just wondering do you have a couple of minutes to talk about some more light hearted things….?” I sat in silence. I was a bit too deep in my thoughts to come out of it by myself. I could have done with T asking me a few more questions to pull me up out. But I know she was there with me. When I didn't say anything more, she brought the session to a close. I kind of nodded at her a few times and I did manage to say goodbye, she said “Stay safe” and I said “You too”. She said “Thankyou, I will do” and then I managed to end the call, which told me I must be partly back in the present because when I end therapy feeling really far away, I have to get T to click the call off. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15963, distribution: 0.9801278114318848 ; Therapy .. // the relationship > everything else  This is just a quick round up of this session because not a lot happened and I didn't write any notes afterwards. I had things I intended to talk about but I just couldn't get my brain to sink into that therapy space. My brain was like “nope I'm going to stay adult this session”. So we started the session talking about the coronavirus. Bear in mind this session was a week and a half ago, before any strong measures had come into force in the UK. We were just on a recommendation to avoid public places if possible. However I'd been rather obsessively following the bbc live news feed about what was going on in Italy and what was likely to be coming our way, so I felt sure that things were going to get more serious. T asked me how things were, and I talked about my coronavirus worries for maybe  minutes. Then T tried to open up the therapy space. She asked if I had a list of things to talk about. I had thought I would talk about how difficult it felt to disagree with her slightly. Last session, we had talked about how I felt H deserved a nicer wife than me. T said that was about identity, and we had talked a little bit about that although I didn't fully embrace her idea. I am not so sure it's about identity. If I was all on my own, I think I feel quite confident in who I am (there's a lot of “I am” statements from the Bible we talked about and I actually feel pretty good about most of them).  My issue is more with, for example, I know H would like me to be all touchy-feely and I'm just not, I feel smothered when he tries to do that draping himself all over me thing. (His brother and his wife do this a lot and when I see them, I just feel guilty about how much H would like it if I was like that) So I feel like H deserves someone who wants to be all touchy feely with him and I feel bad that I can't be that person.  I don't know if that all ties back to identity or not. And that's my problem. I grew up learning that I should never disagree with something my dad said, unless I had a full on defence of my statement lined up in my head. That makes it feel hard to disagree with T sometimes, I feel like how can I say “I'm not sure it's to do with identity” unless I've got a solid defence and counter argument ready. Anyway, I was trying to explain this to T, but she wasn't really getting it and I wasn't really explaining it very well because I kept lapsing into silence. T was asking questions to try and understand, and eventually I pulled a face at her and did a massive sigh. She started to ask me another clarifying question and then broke off and said “Ah no… back off…. that was a big sigh. What did that mean?” I said “My head is just not in the game today”. And then we basically went back to talking about coronavirus for the rest of the session, at which point I got very animated and talkative again after being quite shut down. So that was it, not a whole load of therapy went on. But what can you do? These are difficult times and I was really preoccupied with the goings on - which subsequently turned out to be extremely valid because look what has gone down since then. T hadn't been following the news with quite the same intensity as me and so we weren't quite on the same page, but she did manage to track me ok in the end and stay connected.  It didn't feel like a very productive session, but honestly, we've been doing weekly therapy for  years so I guess a session here or there where we don't do any deep work has to be expected. I'm thankful that we didn't have a rupture and that T managed to reconnect with me before the end. In the end it's about the relationship above anything else.

Doc ID: 2555, distribution: 0.9846107363700867 ; Welcome to the most INTERESTING solo date I've ever had 🥲

Today reminded me that the most important opinion of you is your own! Be you, you are enough 💛

This was another day of overcoming old fears. Growing up, I avoided the beach because I didn't feel comfortable in a bikini. So if I ever went, I wore long t-shirts or a one-piece or a sarong or high-waisted bottoms, just to hide myself. For this week's solo date, I wanted to combat that! Here's how it went 👀

I MAKE THE TIME for these solo dates because it's so important to me to step outside of my comfort zone, challenge myself, grow as a person, maintain my own independence & learn about who I am, what I love doing & how I'm feeling. It's the perfect opportunity to sit in your thoughts, reflect & come back feeling refreshed! 

Even if there were a few doubts & negative opinions being projected onto me by a male stranger in his late 's 🥲

You'll always be “inspirational” in someone's eyes, yet “uninteresting” in someone else's. “Talented” to a friend and “talentless” to another. The world's never gonna agree on a definition of who or what you are, so just focus on you & do what makes you happy 🥰

As you can see, when situations like these arise, my coping mechanism is not to get angry or sad. I get up, shake out the tension/stressful feeling, go for a walk & repeat some affirmations to myself. These are a few of the things I do to help me reframe my mindset when I start thinking negatively towards myself. But tbh, after all of that, I still felt down throughout the day & that's okay too. Not every day has to be a happy one 🌧💛

All in all, even when you're in a relationship, I think it's important to date yourself & have alone time outside of your partner, friends & family! 🙌

What are some ways you work through negative feelings to bring some joy & kindness to your mind??? Would love to hear them 🌸

Also leave a “🙌” in the comments if you're gonna take yourself on a solo date!! Highly recommend ✨

Doc ID: 8698, distribution: 0.9812957644462585 ; trusting your intuition will CHANGE your life.

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right ones👁

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

❌our problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right path🌲no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

🙉you don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people… who would have known i “just” had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

🌟 SOLO DATE DIARY # 🌟 

The reason I started taking myself on these solo date adventures is because I'd always lacked confidence. I was the -year-old without a license or job, relying on my mum to make doctor's appointments for me because I was too afraid to make a phone call. But I knew that version of me was being held back by my fears… So now, at , I've decided to start dating myself. It was my way of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into situations I'd usually avoid, to prove that . I can enjoy my own company and . I WILL grow into my happiest, most confident self 🤝

Remember, the person you want to be is already within you, otherwise you wouldn't want to be that person. The person I AM is confident, kind, spontaneous, motivated, compassionate, isn't afraid to order what she actually wants to eat off the menu, makes friends with strangers, doesn't care what people “might be thinking of her”, she can handle awkwardness & she's proud of who she is! 💪🏼 

In the past I've taken myself to a theme park, the cinema, the arcade, random cafes, the beach, sunrises on the lake, the library & so on… Ahhh, there's so much fun to be had in your own company 🤩 would anyone want SOLO DATE DIARIES to become a thing where I take you along each time?

Doc ID: 9151, distribution: 0.9783617854118347 ; hi! hello! i can't believe it's already been  months since i've posted!! if you are just joining in, you didn't miss much-i took an instagram ~feed~ break in April and dedicated this time and extra space to allow myself to soak in the personal growth i've done in the past year. i took this relatively short time to think about what matters to me and what i REALLY want to share with you .

i hit a wall mentally because i couldn't figure out why my page wasn't "growing" the way it used to. maybe it was because i didn't have one focus the way all big influencers, businesses, entrepreneurs, etc do. was the constant change off putting to people? its hard to NOT share my change because i'm still on my journey.
and then it hit me. i'm still on my way .

if you've been here from the start you got to see me go from university student on #RawTill (shoutout to all my fruitluck friends), to finishing my degree in Nutrition and Dietetics, to unraveling my spiritual self through my yoga travels to India (two in less than  months, actually), and now to being a clinical dietitian advocating a plant-based diet for preventative health. {with plans to study medicine and do more for the plant-based movement} .

so, this is just me. i touch on many things as i go through my life path in the hopes that we might share something in common. to reassure you that you don't need it all figured out and finished just because it seems like everyone else on here is. if you're still here with me, here's what you can expect: -plant-based nutrition and lifestyle
-yoga/mindfulness
-movement and wellness
-authenticity, honesty, real life stuff .
with that said!!! i'm excited to be back. thanks so very much for existing. sending you love
.

Doc ID: 11187, distribution: 0.9782191514968872 ; I literally think this is total M A D N E S S ... I've grown up with a fear of boats, and cried pretty much every time I've set foot on one. I also never liked the sea that much either. All the fish, jellyfish and goodness knows what else in the water that I could never see always freaked me out. I would completely flip each time I'd first get in (and provide very good beach entertainment too 😅). -year-old Holly was even content simply just seeing photos of the underwater world, and always said I'd never want to see it myself.
-
But ok. So here's the thing. I'm now a qualified PADI Open Water Scuba Diver, and as I said, it's total madness to me. Besides dancing, learning to dive has been the most rewarding skill to master and I even want to take it further. I genuinely cannot wait to be back swimming with the fishes ... and sharks ... and turtles ... (if you saw the vlog, you know) 😏
-
And yes, the Great Barrier Reef is beautiful. Waaaay way better than the photos 😉. Enjoy this little montage of Holly in her scuba gear, and again, I want to say a huuuge thank you to @divers_den for being incredible. If I ever return to Australia, I want to be back on the Ocean Quest in Cairns without a doubt, and if you guys want to learn to dive, please check out their tours. For reference, I did the -day course (a gifted experience) which includes your scuba theory, pool work,  training dives and  dives when you qualify (including a night dive) 🦈 It's also the only company in Australia offering up to  dives a day!
-
Oh and the last thing I wanted to say. This all means that I can now share my experiences with my Grandpa, who did a lot of diving himself, instead of just listening to all of his crazy ocean adventures. Maybe we'll have a two-sided conversation next time 🤔😆

Doc ID: 2395, distribution: 0.9780210852622986 ; FLYING TO SYDNEY... SOLO! Come with me on a brand trip! 🚀

This is something I never would've done if I'd never started taking myself on solo dates. I adore working with brands who encourage me to step out of my comfort zone & make the time for myself on such an intimate level… Thank you @cerave_aunz!! #AD
 
I read somewhere that “There is a big world out there. Some journeys take you far from where you come from, but closer to where you belong. Don't wait for someone else to take you by the hand… Just go!”
 
And it couldn't be more true. For me, I'm constantly evolving because I put myself in uncomfy situations. Honestly, I was sweating torrential rain from my armpits because I was nervous and I always second guess what I say and if people are vibing me, but at the same time I know that all I can do is be myself, so whether I “fit in” or not doesn't matter. The only person who has to like me is me. I was SO excited to be somewhere new, with new people, embracing a new sense of confidence and learning new things. It's scary, but I no longer let that control my limits or stop me from stepping out of my comfort zone.
 
While I was on this trip, I realised how important my skincare regime has become. It's that dedicated time in the day, morning and night, where I look at myself in the mirror and declare, “I'm going to look after you. It's you & me baby! I care about you & I'm going to put time into you.” which is something a lot of us don't do and often times something we avoid.
 
I'm so glad I'm prioritising a few minutes every day to take care of my skin & body, inside & out. I know future me will thank me for it!!! Currently, this is my skincare regime:
 AM: Skin Renewing Vitamin C Serum + AM Facial Moisturising Lotion with SPF
PM: Skin Renewing Retinol Serum + Skin Renewing Night Cream, all from @cerave_aunz 
 
Keeping in mind it does change every now & then depending on my lifestyle & how busy I am. If I have more time, I will include other products :)
 
Hope this inspires you to make time for you & give yourself love <

while the new year has already brought me lots of newness, i'm still the same me, and i can't wait to spend this year nurturing this current version of myself.

appreciating you,
being kind to you,
coming home to you.

happy (belated) new year! i hope that this year of endless possibilities and opportunities is also filled with lots of joy, peace, fulfillment, growth, love, connection, and happiness for you 💌

i used to be TERRIFIED of cooking with oil. genuinely afraid of it. a few years ago i swore by steamed everything. cooked my veggies in water ☹️ safe to say eating was NOT a pleasurable experience for me. everyone is different with different needs, but for me, enjoying hearty, nutrient dense veggie dishes like these is not only healing and therapeutic, but also has me actually looking FORWARD to meals. mini rant *over*. note that i'm speaking from a place of deprivation and restriction, NOT of dietary or medical need. just do what works for you, you know? 🤷🏻‍♀️

~fancy~ grilled cheese: fig butter, brie cheese, prosciutto, + greens between  slices of lightly buttered bread cooked on a heated pan for ~- min on each side. i like to pair this with either a side salad or a side of roasted veggies

caesar salad: chopped romaine, chicken, crispy turkey bacon, everything bagel croutons (cut up everything bagel, sprayed with some oil, & air-fried til crispy, + caesar dressing

cheese filled fiocchetti: trader joe's frozen items are a lifesaver when i'm short on time or just want to switch things up! trader joe's cheese filled fiocchetti with pink sauce with chicken sausage + spinach & topped with red pepper flakes

fall chicken + veggie bowl: chopped spinach + greens massaged, roasted brussels sprouts, roasted sweet potato, air-fried chicken drumsticks, + honey goat cheese. this is super easily customizable! you can swap in other roasted veggies and add in nuts + fruits.

chickpea pasta mac & cheese: @eatbanza chickpea pasta, sauce made w/ milk, flour, white cheddar, parmesan, asiago, + romano cheeses, + spices, + broccoli

reminder:

you don't need to compare what or how much you eat to your friend, your partner, your family, your favorite social media influencer, or anyone else.

what someone else eats has nothing to do with what you should eat.

your body.
your needs.
your desires.

Doc ID: 8769, distribution: 0.9790335297584534 ; i started my instagram page as a vegan content creator. while veganism remains a big part of my life, i've taken a back seat from sharing much food content because i care more about the RELATIONSHIP we have to food than the actual food itself.

still- food is a love language to so many people &  i know that it can be helpful to see others give themselves permission to eat whatever feels good while listening to their bodies💕

i'd love to keep making fun content like this to show what is possible with eating less meat & dairy (if that's what you choose to do)

through my many trials of content creation, i have made peace with the fact that MAKING recipes is not my thing… but EATING and sharing the deets is 😂 

SO with that- i am GRATEFUL for my healthy taste buds! we visited @cafegratitude this weekend for lunch & my body was so happy that i could taste such amazing meals & be nourished by the vegan goodness! here's what i got, in the order of the video:

✨I AM INFINITE (adaptaccino mocha shake): almond milk, Mind's Eye powder, cacao powder, cacao nibs, espresso, cinnamon, date, sweet almond whip, smoked salt
✨YO SOY VIDA (“machaca” mexican breakfast hash): Mushroom carnitas, tofu scramble, tomato, red onion, red pepper, black beans, brown rice, salsa rustica, choice of corn tortillas or tortilla chips
✨I AM GRACIOUS (asparagus & tomato confit): arugula, persian cucumbers, avocado, cashew mozzarella, basil hempseed pesto, balsamic reduction, brazil nut parmesan, cauliflower hempseed rice
✨I AM FIERY (spicy buffalo wrap): buffalo cauliflower, ranch dressing, pickled carrots, romaine, scallions
✨I AM HOLY (baked doughnuts)
✨I AM MINDFUL (strawberry rhubarb pie)
✨I AM COSMIC (antioxidant spirulina latte)

if i had to get ONE thing for a filling weekend brunch, i'd get the I AM FIERY wrap. if it's a workday or a quick bite, the I AM GRACIOUS (don't be fooled by the fact that it's a salad) slaaapppssss.

i don't share “what i eat in a day”s because i personally think they are more harmful than they are helpful, but i'm all for sharing meal ideas, so save if you need some meal inspo!

lox bagel sammie (getting lox to add to my bagels for the week always feels like such a treat! add cream cheese, red onion, or whatever fix ins you like)

winter salad (greens tossed in olive oil, acv, maple syrup, and s+p w/ roasted brussel sprouts, roasted butternut squash, pan-seared chicken, turkey bacon, beets, and goat cheese)

steak and veggie stir fry with rice (steak marinated in soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, cornstarch, sugar, garlic powder, and salt)

burrito bowl w/ whatever protein, veggies, and flavors you like (the easiest mexican-inspired shredded chicken requires just  ingredients- chicken and salsa. add chicken and a jar of salsa to a slow cooker, cook on low for - hours, and shred)

protein oats (a bfast favorite of mine. i like to add vanilla protein to mine and top w/ frozen blueberries, dark chocolate chips, and nut butter)

lemon alfredo pasta w/ spinach and seared scallops (a fun switch up from my typical pasta w/ red sauce. sear scallops in a mix of avocado oil and butter for  min on one side and  min on the other)

avocado toast (a classic. i highly recommend the san francisco style sourdough bread from trader joe's. i topped mine w/ sea salt, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of evoo)

instant ramen w/ - min eggs and wilted spinach and baby kale (i like to make my own sauce with soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, and honey)

roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and butternut squash paired w/ air-fried chicken breast and goat cheese (this is a super easy meal that can be prepped ahead of time. veggies roasted at  degrees for about  min and chicken air-fried at  degrees for  min)

broccoli and kale slaw salad w/ pan-fried tofu (no shame in using salad kits for convenience! the broccoli and kale slaw from trader joe's is one of my favorites. i toss my tofu in soy sauce, paprika, and garlic powder, and i like to have a side of bread for balance and satisfaction)

if you're not brushing the outside of your sandwiches with pesto before toasting them on the stovetop… drop everything and try it right now. i don't know how i haven't tried this sooner but i don't think i can ever go back to eating a sandwich any other way 😂 

this feta avocado PESTO CRUSTED SANDWICH is probably the most flavorful sandwich i've made to date. here's what we've got: a layer of pesto on the inside paired with fresh avocado, salty feta, and refreshing cucumber slices laying in hummus. on the outside, another rich and toasty layer of pesto crusted in the sourdough. if you're wondering, yes i shed a tear typing that vivid description hahaha

feta avocado pesto crusted sandwich 

toast two slices of sourdough to your liking, then spread/layer on the following:

- basil pesto (i used vegan)
- fresh avocado slices 
- crumbled feta cheese (i used vegan)
- garlic hummus
- thin sliced cucumber 

sandwich the pieces together, brush both sides with pesto (!!), cook on the stovetop for - min on each side or until crispy and fragarent. slice and enjoy!

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

this is one of my favorite flavor combos to date!

sun-dried tomato and basil pesto pasta salad

start by cooking your pasta according to the package. the one i used said to boil for  minutes, but i found  minutes to be perfect. while those are cooking. once the noddles are done cooking, drain and rinse with cold water. add to a bowl and add the following:

- cucumber slices
- diced green onion
- diced red onion
- avocado chunks
- sun-dried tomatoes 
- feta cheese crumbles
- arugula

toss everything together and then add in the basil pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

VAGINA. DICK. INTERCOURSE”. dim lighting helps if ur self conscious, but yea once ur bodies are like out there… and all smooshed together it's a lot less nerve wracking than u'd think, bc its not like they're staring at all of u at once. they're only looking at one given part of u at any given time. & theres ways to bend and contort and hold urself so u dont feel or look completely exposed, youll see. dont do anything u arent comfortable with but dont let urself get held back from any experience just bc ur self conscious!!! men are literally ugly so if anyone is self conscious, its him. he's lucky you're even considering granting him access to your palace. forreal. you just gotta do it and once you do anything you realize its never as bad as u construed it to be in ur anxious brain 🖤🖤🖤 also dont be sorry its not stupid i completely understand your worries

Doc ID: 23060, distribution: 0.988503634929657 ; Question: Hi :) I'm recovering from my eating disorder, I think I'm stuck in a quasi recovery (halfway relapsing i guess) . I feel like a loser like I'm not % sick or % recovering, I can't fast for days like before but as the same time I'm not responding to my hunger cure at the time like what I did at the beginning of my recovery. At that time I was so determined. I'm neither “successful” in having an ed nor recovering. Sorry if this triggered anyone, stay safe sending virtual hugs:) Answer: (my writing can come across as aggressive sometimes so im saying this now to make sure we're cool: im not mad at you at all. Im happy you sent this. This mini rant is not directed to you personally, i promise. youre cool as hell. )man everybody really needs to stop assigning rankings and levels to eating disorders and recovery. theres no leveling system for how bad an ed is or successful recovery is. theres no percentage. thats all made up to make you feel like shit. theres no such thing as % sick or % sick or % sick. either you are sick or you are not. either you are struggling or you are not. The fact that you even entered recovery in the first place PROVES you were sick. Who the fuck cares ““what percentage”“ of sick you were. that shit isnt real. Your ed just wants you to feel like ass and pretend it was never “that bad” so you'll come back to it. its all a manipulation tactic. its bullshit. “Sorry you have % cancer, not enough for any kind of treatment, we are gonna wait until you waste away to % cancer to do anything about it” ??????????? thats not how this works. and on the topic of quasi recovery.. i see that shit everywhere. and so many people slip into it when they get the idea that they werent % sick to begin with.. so they cling to the ed, because maybe THIS TIME they WILL be % sick enough.. but they disguise it as recovery to make everyone else happy. Its not a good place to be. Never build your mental health on lies. Its REALLY great that you noticed this and are aware of it. REALLY great. Because you now have the choice to take the next step toward real recovery and the next step AWAY from ed. “% recovery” is just living without an eating disorder. and that shit takes WORK. hard work. I want you to know youre feelings about it are normal. it happens waayy too often i promise you, youre not a loser or faking anything. Normies dont question themselves like this. Normies dont even consider questioning themselves like this. All sickness needs healing no matter what degree of pain someone is in.

Doc ID: 23909, distribution: 0.9884429574012756 ; how annoying.  ive been getting  hrs of sleep a night for the last  weeks because of my animals. ive woken up in the night screaming hysterically for seemingly no reason, ive woken up to my animals having difficulties and in grave danger bitch in . seconds. im losing my balance struggling to dress and they just keep knocking so now im screaming hysterically and my window is cracked near the front of the house so all I hear is my grandma going “WHAT!?”. and then I realize it' my grandma. and then . seconds later I finally get this hoodie zipped over my bare tits and I clear a flight of stairs and finally get to the door and shes just driving away. like REALLY? what the FUCK was that? I don't even feel bad im not even going to turn my phone on and apologize for cussing at her unknowingly like im not even gonna explain myself because I just don't care. she lives  min away she can go home. I cant ever get one nice day of sleep. I don't know what everyone wants from me. im doing so much right now and im doing my best and I cant even turn my phone off and sleep for  hours for one fucking day when I really need it,. im losing my mind I just need to be left alone. she knows my cat died yesterday and if im not answering my phone why would you just show up and start frantically knocking. can you not knock and wait. I get that its cold but like realistically I don't know what the fuck she was thinking or expecting or wanting. people  never wanna help me they always just wanna bother me.  and im not even talking about yal. everyone on the internet his mostly either been supportive or apathetic which I appreciate/don't mind. but life doesn't exist inside of the internet unfortunately. I can only play escapism to feel better for so long until I have to come back to reality or get behind on it. I feel like im always being the bigger person and comforting everyone else in my life but nobody can ever afford that same courtesy to me and its really getting old.  the least u cld do is leave me the fuck alone so I can focus figuring out how to give myself the energy that im constantly giving everyone else. I just wanted some relief from the intrusive thoughts today but now we're up and at it since the dogs had to lose their fucking shit. I honestly hate these dogs im so sick of them.  I don't know why we had to have . everything was fine when I had MY dog, and my dad had his, . but then my fucking waste of space brother decides hE wAnTs a DoG tOo because its not fair that We BoTh HaVe OnE.  so my spineless father gets him a fucking dog that he cant even take care of for a WEEK and now we just have this dumbass untrained puppy taking up space and eating shit and making messes and fucking up the pack dynamic with the other .  my dog has always been challenging with behavioral problems and they've just gotten tenfold worse since this fucking rd dog came into our lives. now its to the point where she isn't even manageable for me.  I hate this third dog. hes not disciplined.  my dad doesn't discipline any of the dogs and he always enables them and undoes the work that ive put in with their unruly asses. I hate it.  I hate having  big dogs constantly in my way and trying to boss me around and lurk and steal me and my other animal's food. I never asked for that responsibility. I never asked for any of these responsibilities.  I have  animals that belong to me and THEY ARE MANAGEABLE by themselves but once you throw in the family cat with a tumor that NOBODY else was paying attention to or worrying about, and  other huge ass dogs that don't get adequate attention bc my dad and brother are pieces of shit who don't get up from their desks more than x a day tops. if theyre even here. so I get stuck tending to their asses.  im just over it.  I love animals but theyare taking over my life and not in a good way. literally my only friends are animals and theyre gonna die soon too and then im left with nothing. nothing done, no friends, no money. nothing. because I spent it all on  extra animals that I never even signed up to fucking have.  I signed up for . not fucking . the animals wont leave me alone humans wont leave me alone im literally ready to flip a bitch and explode because all I want is to be left alone.  if nobody wants to even try making me feel better, if nobody can bring themselves to be considerate for once…. then just LEAVE ME ALONE. WHATS IT GONNA FUCKING TAKE. most days I don't actually want to kill myself, sometimes I actually do. but these days I feel like I don't even have a choice and one day its going to be my only option because I cannot escape my frustration

Doc ID: 23269, distribution: 0.9876991510391235 ; This self quarantine is hard and I really miss interacting with people in my life. Im seriously contemplating giving my friend a call….. And I hate talking on the phone. 
 I will blatantly admit my Ed is LOVING this and is thriving. I've been binging daily. But there isnt much I can really do about it, my environment has always had an impact on my ed and until the environment changes, my ed wont change. So i just have to live with the ed behaviors until its time to work on recovery again when life allows it. But i cant stop thinking about food and food delivery. RIP.  What are y'all doing to stay sane? Ive been working on art, organizing my website and my art instagram. Trying to make more sales lol i have some big art projects to begin but i think im intimidated by them. Lots of cleaning as my family couldnt care less about the outbreak and im an at risk individual so i have to care for my own safety here. Theres no way I would live through it. Randomly bleached my hair the other day for funsies. Gonna do it again tomorrow (i have dark hair and i need more bleach to get out the brassy color) might chop it and put in tinsel too because fuck it who the fuck cares. Trying REALLY hard not to depression shop. I always go crazy with online shopping during depressive episodes and Im really trying to avoid it this time.Still enjoying The Witcher  it helps me calm down and relax and not think about any troubles. Im also chipping my way through the  DOOM but that game is nuts and I really need to be ready to feel the rage and adrenalin when I play. I lean more towards relaxation than aggression.  But both feel great.  Every day im on full dog duty, i cook his meals multiple times and prepare his medicine and administer it and i take him outside and i bring him fresh water throughout the day and help him on and off the couch as he is very old. Im so tired but i love him so much. Idk why he is still alive. Maybe he just likes it here.  
 My mental health is shit these days. And I know i would be safe under a  but now really isnt the time to go to the ER or a facility packed with people. Big yikes. I wish i stayed on my meds cuz my brain is inside out and everything feels awful. Seeing things, hearing things, im paranoid / im getting nightmares again, everything blows. 
 
 At least i have my dog to snuggle and horror movies to binge watch.

THAT sauce. first i will display this cringetastic inbox shot and then i will give context and ill try to make it brief but I NEEd some input so please if u love juice and u have an opinion i could use u  so this is a person i met a few months ago - on my weed / bizniz instagram. he lives like a mile away from me and he pays me  an hour (nice) to help him gram out wax and trim and label jars n wtf ever. hes a bit older than me (//) but hes smart and talented at growing / processing rly quality weeds. so we have that in common. ive always had an innocent crush on him bc i like his nice teeth and nice tattoos and surprisingly his bald head bc hes not ashamed of it so good for him. anyhow i had a dream once that i licked him on the nose and ive been repressing my feelings since because hes already seen me thru some pretty rough weeks and i had already convinced myself that he thought i was entirely neurotic just bc .. its hard for me to hide lmao. shit, maybe he does and just doesnt care.. anywho innocent crush right. didnt think he was interested in me. im supposed to go help him trim tomorrow and thIS IS WHAT he sends me tonight like hello how am i supposed to handle this im in a relationship with an asshole that i still love and i dont like cheaters and i wouldnt want to be cheated on so i dont wANT to cheat but my boyfriend literally crazy makes me and has my heart in tangles and then theres this ole guy so cool n casual in the corner (LMAO) like “hhhbbrrggbb hey i wanna FuCK YEH”. like how endearing yano. im attracted to him but i was honestly just flourishing in my own sexual tension and i didnt know it was mutual so now i feel obligated to back off and just not see him but like (i actually really need money… and im out of smoke…… and seeing him tmrw guarantees both) (and i still like the.. seccual.. tensions….🥴) but im suppose to be a goodly adult arent i and to be perfectly REAL WITH YAL my vagina tingles at the thought of sex'ing him but THATS IT JUST THE THOUGHT. i dont want to do anything to compromise the mess im already in and i dont ever get away with shit, karma literally lives on my back and walks life with me every step of the way.  i dont even like thinking about it like that id just like to think that its wrong and bad but HEY HERE WE ARE and im most likely gonna go over his house tmrw anyways and idk how to gracefully ignore OR tackle the elephant in the room should it arise pls oh god yal i have  girlfriends weighing in on this i literally have nobody to consult what the fuck how do i handle this i havent felt giddy abt anything or anyone in so long it sucks that i cant just have this with the person i picked  years ago last time i even THOUGHT. CONSIDERED sex'ing someone who wasnt my bf he straigjt up died the day before we were supposed to hang out so i rly feel like that was a bad omen / warning / whatever on top of super unfortunate circumstances. i wish i was making this up lol rest in angst gary..
