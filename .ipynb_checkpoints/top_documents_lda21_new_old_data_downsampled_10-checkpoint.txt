Doc ID: 7401, distribution: 0.8624103333404158 ; Question: When you say safety from family what do you mean? Like you don't want someone you know in real life to recognize you? Answer: I talk about family stuff a lot and I don't want to hurt anyone or make them angry and they also don't know everything about how I identify and I want to keep it that way. I also like being anonymous bc it makes me feel more comfortable being honest. I guess I might be open to people knowing who I am but only if you think you already know and private message me and I might be willing to confirm or deny it.

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
good mood food energy bites: - / cup raw cashews
- / cup raw walnuts
-  tbsp ground flax
- / cup @eatnuttzo creamy peanut butter
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  tsp maca powder
- sea salt
- vanilla

add all ingredients to a food processor and blend until thick, sticky batter forms. roll into balls and place on a sheet of parchment paper. roll in extra toppings of choice (i used diced almonds and cacao nibs)

Doc ID: 7213, distribution: 0.8146126662980299 ; how do we heal when the world says no? how do we heal when what hurts us is right in front of us? how do we heal when the toxic thoughts and beliefs and pressures and fears that we work every single day to shed and silence live so boldly in those around us?

what does it mean to be selfish? are we selfish enough? healing is selfish, healing is vital. sometimes i look at the those around me and find that there's no place for me to grow there. is this selfish? maybe it's vital. maybe we need to talk more about protecting ourselves.

i think through questions like these a lot. i find them to be especially pressing during the holiday season. for me and many others, this time of year is marked by more time spent in others' company (this year may be more virtual, but still connecting nonetheless) and an elevated focus on food and indulgence. when i was recovering from my eating disorder, i simply couldn't enjoy the holidays- instead i was suffocating, drowning in anxiety. i wish i had the right tools and support to prepare myself for things like large gatherings and triggering comments about food/bodies/exercise.

like most of the content i create here, i always begin by asking myself what would have served me when i was struggling. what did i need that didn't exist?

i couldn't be more excited to share 'Lean on This' with you all. i spent weeks creating this holiday season mental health and wellness guide with my past self in mind. it covers topics such as dealing with the holiday food scene and associated guilt and how to manage/respond to triggering comments from family and friends, to name a few. 

i know this time of year can be hard for a million and one reasons. i know we all have our own battles. my hope with this guide is that it can help you prepare yourself for discomfort, help you not to lose sight of your healing. help you to protect yourself while still finding joy and peace in this special time of year.

this guide lives on my website and is free for everyone to access :) the link will be in my bio.

yes, i care about my health and well-being, and yes, i eat ALL foods because ALL FOODS CAN CO-EXIST IN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE 🥯🍨🫐🍕🥗🍜🍟🥑🍰

additional reminders:

pursuing health doesn't mean you have to restrict yourself

obsessing and stressing over food is a lot less healthy than whatever food your stressing about

eating foods you enjoy is crucial to living a sustainable healthy lifestyle

what's healthy for one person may not be healthy for another

there is no such thing as “perfect” eating

food is fuel and also SO MUCH MORE!

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
instant pot red curry -  tbsp red curry paste
-  diced onion
-  medium diced red bell peppers
-  head cauliflower florets
-  eggplants, skinned and cubed
-  cup butternut squash chunks
-  can full fat coconut milk
-  can diced tomatoes
-  cup grape tomatoes
-  cups vegetable broth
-  cup spinach
- sea salt
- garlic powder
- curry powder
- ginger
- cumin

i like roasting my veggies beforehand for this curry. i tossed the eggplant chunks, cauliflower florets, and butternut squash chunks in olive oil and sea salt and roasted at  for about  minutes. you can do this the day before or right before cooking, works either way! 
set the instant pot to sauté and add a generous amount of oil. add the onions and sauté for a minute before adding the curry paste. once softened, add the diced peppers and mix through, cooking for about two or three minutes. at this point add the remaining ingredients (if you dont roast the veggies before, just add them in raw here). stir until well-combined. set instant pot to pressure cook for  minutes. once done cooking leave the natural pressure release on for  minutes before venting. add spinach at the end and mix through to wilt before serving! .

 on the topic of binge eating: binges, whether they are objectively identified or subjectively experienced as such, nearly always have an identifiable source, which can be broken down into  main ones: ) transgression of one's dietary rules, leading to a temporary abandoning of said rules; ) undereating, where binges stem from a physiological need that is not being met; ) substance use, where inhibitions are lifted and food rules become less rigid; and ) adverse mood or external event, where the binge acts as an emotional regulator to dampen the negative feelings produced by the event.  each of these can be a trigger for binge eating on their own, but can also interact with others. identifiying and analyzing the source of each binge is a necessary step to understand the process leading to it and, over time, will help in regaining control over binge urges.  source

currently still recovering from my weekend trip, but houston  has a lot of incredible food to offer, and i wanted to share the spots i visited!

swipe for this weekend's highlight reel/photo dump and an important monday reminder —>

@mad.houston
a really vibrant and exciting atmosphere with delicious cocktails and a unique take on spanish cuisine. the highlights of our meal were the gin cocktails, the grilled octopus, and the pictured huevos rancheros dessert (passion fruit mousse, mascarpone cream, and white chocolate aerated rocks).

@wearevibrant
a casual restaurant with a modern, open, and airy interior. they serve an all day menu with a lot of great options for anyone with dietary restrictions. one of the best matcha lattes i've had.

@milkandsugarcreamery
a handcrafted ice cream shop with unique flavors and specializing in fun house-made mix-ins. i got the thai tea and rain or shine (earl grey, lemon, + lavender) flavors, and they were both really tasty.

@uchihouston
some of the best sushi i've ever had. an amazing experience with great service, nicely timed courses, and innovative flavorful preparations of melt-in-your-mouth sushi. every bite was incredible!

@tinysmilkandcookies
a cute walk-up dessert shop connected to a full-service restaurant. their chocolate chip cookies were the star of the show and are super flavorful, soft, and chewy.

@torchystacos
a local chain serving a variety of tacos. the queso was super tasty, and the tacos were really good too.

@localfoodstexas
i really liked this place and could see myself going often if i lived nearby. a no-fuss cafeteria style restaurant offering a ton of fresh, flavorful, and interesting sandwiches and salads.

@sweetcupgelato
a fun gelato and sorbet shop with a great variety of rotating flavors including classics such as pistachio and dark chocolate along with unique flavors such as black sesame and lavender & guajillo-honey tres leches.

big thank you to @ev.degroot for showing me around your city! so grateful college brought us together, and there was no one else i'd rather explore houston with ❤️

Then I wrote out a timetable for this morning and d and d played with the babies while I got everything sorted. It was sooo good. Even posting pictures now makes me want to eat it all over again. I love mint sauce soooo much. Amusingly though, we can't let anyone in real life know about it because everyone's bringing us meals on the basis that we don't have capacity to cook for ourselves. So if anyone asks, we just had a bowl of cornflakes each. Of course we had Easter Eggs for dessert.

you deserve to live a really truly happy life, and to do that, you have to learn to let go because where energy goes, energy flows. letting go of anything can be really hard because how things already are may feel safe, and with most loss, there's a sense of grief that comes with it. but, i promise you that the things and people that only add negativity to your life are not worth holding onto, and there is so much life beyond what you're used to that will open up to you when you make the space for it.

in order to keep moving forward, we need to let go of the energy that is no longer meant for us and free ourselves from the chains that are holding us back. your life won't be empty, your life will be open, open to receiving more opportunities, building healthier relationships, creating positivity, receiving calm energy, and becoming fuller than it ever was before.

you deserve that.

relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

even if you're not where you want to be, look at how far you've come!! i'm so proud of you, and if you need the reminder: each moment is another chance at a new beginning, and it's never too late to choose yourself 🌷

Also I'm guessing they can't confirm whether or not she was a past client. I've paid for the appointment though so that should count for something.  Also worrying about d.  months ago she got a really bad infection in her outer ear (“swimmers ear”) that ended up with a hospital stay and some quite traumatic treatment. After our few days away in the house with a pool, she's complaining of ear pain again. I'm really really hoping it doesn't get as bad as last time. I think we may need to be heading to the GP on Monday, so hard to know whether it'll clear up itself or not.

I'm not wasting their time, because I can't know what is going on with my body without their expertise. I'm not stupid, because getting checked out was a wise decision. And they're not going to shout at me, because I'm not a child now, I'm an adult, and they're not my dad.

If you've been following the ups and downs of our relationship, you'll know how much that means. I can't remember if I wrote about it, but a couple of weeks ago things came to a head and I had a big and emotional chat with her one evening after she'd been particularly dismissive of us all over the evening meal. I can see she has been truly trying a bit harder since then. It reinforces my belief that she doesn't understand how other people feel until it is spelt out to her really clearly. And that holding the boundaries even while she pushes and pushes against them is actually giving her a sense of security. I also have hope now that she will grow through this phase and come to like us all again. Because now it's been made clear to her how she makes us feel, she is trying to improve that. Only in little ways but I see it. And the others see it too. Maybe the issue before was just that she didn't realise or think how we were being affected by her actions.  This afternoon she has baked a complicated five layer cake filled with buttercream and strawberries. It has been a complex dance for me of helping her make a success of it and being around and alongside her, while also ensuring that I give her enough space and privacy to get on with it. It was the classic push-pull…. “mum ok you can go away now… oh but mum how do you do this?” often repeated several times, catching me each time I was nearly out of the kitchen. She was so proud of her finished cake and when the others got in from the cinema we had a big reveal and everyone had a slice. d tolerated about  minutes with us, eating cake and telling her how wonderful it was, and then she retreated back up to her bedroom. It was a special afternoon and will keep me going for some time even if she goes back to hating us all for days on end now, I have hope that we will get through this 💕

- improves cholesterol levels by lowering total and  LDL (the bad) cholesterol
- the high amount of antioxidants can counteract the damaging effects of inflammation and oxidation in brain cells, improving memory and learning
- nutrient dense, containing chromium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus with only  calories per g

ACAI DRAWBACKS - theyre not the only source of antioxidants
- can make a dent in your wallet
- may be made with sneaky added sugars

TLDR- MY OPINION

Acai smoothies or bowls are a great way to cool down on a hot day and add in extra antioxidants that can improve so many functions (immunity, skin, digestion, memory/learning) but arent necessary to love a healthy lifestyle. I personally like to get acai bowls when I'm out as a treat (shoutout to @cafegratitude for this Vibrant bowl) and when I'm home I stick to the basic bananas and berries for my smoothie bowls. Plus there's something magical about the experience of getting an acai bowl ❤️ admittedly they are cheaper if you make em at home but I like the whole shebang. do you make your own acai bowls at home? #amandasacaiadventures #acaibowl #cafegratitude #blessedretreat #MyBlessingLA #vegan #acai #acainutrition

I felt that way this morning, and at lunch I almost succumbed. BUT I ended up stopping myself from binging and having more of a snack-based lunch instead. Similarly, after my walk, I started feeling like a binge was coming, and I started making the tell-take rounds through the kitchen. BUT I stopped myself before it progressed to far. I'm disappointed that I haven't been able to stop overeating as much, but my goal for these  days was to stop binging. If I focus my energy on that for now, and put weight loss on the back burner, then I'll have the necessary tools to begin a healthy weight loss journey. So I just need to remind myself that overeating, while not great, still doesn't equate a binge. And I've made it a whole week without binging!  PLUS I can tell that I'm getting more confident in my own ability to control myself. Twice today I was able to tell myself NO and it worked.  One thing I really want to work on is having set, filling meals. I think part of the reason I had issues at lunch  and dinner was because I wasn't sure what I was going to eat for the meals and the uncertainty left room for a binge to start.

I am very happy to eat lunch, but I have a list of requirements that must be in place for me to do so. For example, it must be after pm, the baby must be asleep, there must be nothing outstanding that needs doing, ideally no one else in the kitchen etc. All the Swiss cheese slices must be lined up with a perfect hole passing all the way through and I can only eat lunch when that happens. Seeing it in this picture format has made it feel quite clear to me.

Doc ID: 2957, distribution: 0.941347510333619 ; Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that's not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say  years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it's up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that's the foster care that we do. Then there's permanence foster care. This is when the child won't be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they're + and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there's adoption, where usually there isn't any contact with the birth family. There isn't much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic  weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the (+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it's done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were  years ago. However it's one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day . To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past.

Doc ID: 9562, distribution: 0.6278303467464038 ; i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they're meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

do you see your body in parts and pieces?

or do you see yourself as a whole entire person and your body as the vessel for your soul?

i spent so long viewing my own body as an object that could be broken up into pieces and “fixed”. i viewed my body as a shape of a fruit or a geometric object that i was taught to a maintain a certain way and dress to accentuate the “good” parts, cover up the “bad” parts, and “correct” and “balance out” as a whole.

while it's perfectly up to you if you want to accentuate parts of yourself in the way you dress or even pose in pictures, what happens when we start seeing ourselves as bits and pieces rather than who we are and all that we are capable of is that we start tying our value to how we appear. at some point along the way, it can be easy to forget and lose faith that our self-worth is unconditional and lies far beyond what we look like.

you are so much more than your body, and you owe nobody to shrink, change, manipulate, or hide your body.

People do not choose to develop eating disorders, and unfortunately we cannot will them away, just as we cannot will away a broken bone or a cold. And just like with a broken bone, seeking professional help is not only OK - it's a brave step in the healing process. If you are struggling with an eating disorder, there is absolutely no shame in asking for and receiving help. We are not meant to do this alone. ⁠

.
.
over , photos and videos documenting relapse after relapse after relapse. for years i've put off deleting these reminders of my past. i've hung onto them, never looking at them, really. rather, simply harboring a certain comfort of accessibility. at the tips of my fingers at any time.

sometimes i'd scroll through them just to remember what once was. not because i missed it necessarily. more so to remind myself of how far i've come and how much has changed.

Doc ID: 7370, distribution: 0.8896023472326641 ; i created this account the summer before my senior year of HS. after a year of half-assed recovery attempts and inevitable relapses, i finally committed to true healing. to hold myself accountable for my meal plan, i turned to IG. i anonymously documented everything i ate in a food diary, right here on this feed.

when i created this account, i was directionless. i was conflicted, between holding onto the eating disorder i had come to know as my identity, and letting go, seeking a life of greater purpose. 
what i needed at that time was to see what life was like beyond initial recovery. i needed to see why i should endure the agony. i needed to see genuine healing, body acceptance, restored relationships with food/exercise. i needed proof that life wouldn't be dark forever.

that was  years ago. my needs have shifted since then. this account is now a celebration of life. i hold a soft spot for eating disorder warriors, past and present. i think of you always, above all. 
here, you won't find means of comparison; think pictures of my body, full days of eating, workout routines. you won't find darkness; think negative self talk, body shaming, food labeling. 
what you will find are glimpses into an illuminated existence; think reflections on mental health, a passion for cooking, a love for living. you will find little details that make up a big life; think books i'm reading, and music i'm listening to, and the friendships that fill me up.

when i develop content for this account, i always keep the girl i was at the beginning of all of this in mind. what content would serve her? what content would deter her? i share accordingly. i'm here to make up for the years i wasn't alive, not in a way that matters. i'm here to prove that healing isn't easy, but it's worth the world. 
this account is a collection of moments of a life redeemed. you'll find glimpses into a girl who has hurt, who has been there. a girl who is showing you that life gets better. brighter. lighter. 
regardless of your past, i hope you can find light in this tiny corner of mine. may we connect through the simple fact that we are both alive and are striving to grow. 
thank you for being here ⚡️

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
VEGAN copycat cookie cake bars

set oven to . grease a loaf pan. in a small bowl, make a flax egg by mixing together  tbsp ground flax and . tbsp water. let sit until thick.

in a large bowl mix together: - / cup coconut sugar
- / cup melted coconut oil
- splash of vanilla

ad the flax egg and stir until everything is thoroughly combined. then add: -  cup almond flour
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

mix until a thick, sticky dough forms. fold through chocolate chips of choice, then cover bowl and place in fridge for  minutes.

meanwhile, in a food processor add: - / cup almond butter
- / cup soft pitted dates
- pinch of sea salt

run the blender. after a few seconds, slowly pour in a tablespoon of warm water and let it run through the mixture. add one more if the blade isn't moving much! the mix here should be sticky and rollable, not watery.

add the almond butter/date mixture to the dough, the mix thoroughly with hands until sticky and well combined. if the batter is a dit dry, feel free to add up to  tbsp dairy free milk. stir through chocolate chips at this point as well! transfer dough to the loaf pan and press down until even. bake for about  minutes, then let cool completely before slicing

.
.
i have no idea what comes next.
.

i'm a firm believer in things falling into place, things happening for a reason. always investing my trust in the universe or some higher power, whatever that may be.
.
.
but this doesn't mean i'm not intimidated by whichever next steps i inevitably face. .
.
i have so many passions and ideas and projects i want to pursue but worry i'm not moving quickly enough. i have so many roles i see myself excelling at but worry i'm not qualified enough. i worry about my resume. i worry about my gpa. i worry about my job performance and spending habits and my ability to plan for the future when living in the moment has been such a healing mindset for me this past year.
.
.
wherever i'm meant to be after graduation, i know i'll find my way. i don't expect things to work out instantly. i've always been late when it comes to these kinds of things. i spent six years of my life sick and alone before i started to live fully. six whole years behind my peers. but i got there.
.
.
when i get down on myself in moments like this i try to build myself back up. i know i'm resilient and can navigate hardship. i know i'm passionate and fully invested in creating something from nothing. i know i'm capable and dedicated. these are hard things for me to say. they feel selfish, obnoxious. .
.
i'm working on being more comfortable supporting myself. there should be no shame in recognizing our own strengths. for all the worry that hangs over me over the next few months, knowing i have a strong head on my shoulders helps me move forward.

.
even if i'm not quite sure what i'm walking into just yet. all in good time.

Doc ID: 5111, distribution: 0.9297965832479402 ; rd August  I think I've hit a bit of a wall! My get up and go has got up and gone. But I carry on, just rather wearily, like ploughing through treacle. I did the parkrun this morning while H had the babies and took the car to get a new tyre. The tyre took longer than expected but he did eventually manage to meet me after the parkrun and we went for a coffee in the same outdoor cafe as yesterday. Parkrun was a slow one. I knew I didn't have the energy to push myself so I just took it steady but even so my legs were running on empty. I think I am probably exerting more calories than I'm taking in, even though I'm stubbornly pushing myself to eat three meals a day and mostly succeeding. I think I should eat more but my rigid brain doesn't want to bend that way. This afternoon we have hung out at home, taking it in turns to entertain the babies and do jobs. I managed a nice period of one-handed jigsaw doing (I was bouncing baby  in the bouncy chair with the other hand) outside in the warm weather, so that was good. A little bit of (almost) me-time. H and I also took it in turns to each have a short nap on the sofa. Now it's the evening. We might get a Chinese takeaway later but H and the girls are out, and I am home with two sleeping babies, so I'm waiting for the others to get back. I'm sitting with the remaining mess of the day around me, and ignoring it while I drink a glass of white wine and try and catch up with the babies' daily diaries. I'm supposed to write in them every day but I'm pretty rubbish at remembering and always end up writing a few days at a time. I really hate to admit it, but I think two babies for three weeks may be my limit.

Doc ID: 1804, distribution: 0.7950519071184896 ; Hello Anon.Hope youre doing okay as well!!Bro im an artist i dont know medical science. All i can offer is a really dumbed down version of some thoughts that may or may not be accurate. Are you talking about muscle cramping? I think muscle cramping is connected to what we feed our bodies (and what our bodies are lacking). I would always get achey and sore and also get cramping in my legs and lower back when i was in my ed. Even now that i eat plenty and am at a higher weight i still get cramps now and then. Im probably lacking in specific nutrients or minerals or whatever my body needs. Idk! I also crack my joints and sometimes if i cant get it to pop i get extra aches. I also very little muscle definition and am weak so i get sore easily. Maybe you can relate to any of that?Do you have swelling?Does propping your legs up on a pillow help at all? Theres probably a lot of things it could be. Bad joints? Weak muscles? Maybe physical therapy to build up the strength? Idek. I dont have any answers here. Sorry dude.. If you are able to email a doctor maybe that could help youI have heard many times that when we are deep into ed for a long time and then finally come out of it into recovery, all the medical issues start to show up. :/ Sorry for the long response. I miss human interaction. Maybe someone else reading this can say something a lot smarter than i

Lately I've been taking my practice as an opportunity to connect with myself as deeply as I can. Daring to explore deeper within myself. which muscles are really engaged? Which are stretching? How do I create more stability? what other muscles can lengthen when im in this posture other than my hamstrings? Where else can I be more mindful? How can I slow down the movement? These questions and the like have me focused on my movement and breath more than anything in my practice and block out room for boredom or anxiety. Breathe in, monkey brain out🙊🙊

“The mind is a strange machine which can combine the materials offered to it in the most astonishing ways, but without materials from the external world it is powerless.”  —  
 alternatively, biocentrism theorizes that there is no material world outside of percieved consciousness. without consciousness, there is no observer to the material world. if theres no observation, does it even exist? 
 the mind is a vessel, non-local consciousness inhabits it. without consciousness, it is powerless. no material. without consciousness, the material world is also powerless.

Doc ID: 4030, distribution: 0.8463951988201545 ; Thurs  Feb  The last thing H said to me this morning before he went to work was “Why don't you just have a restful day today.” It seemed quite possible at am this morning, with the whole day stretching ahead of me.  I got a text from d in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said “Can you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.” Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an  minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn't pass 😭. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn't a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I'd ordered wasn't there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn't ordered was there. So we made a profit of  packs of brioche,  packs of krispie cakes,  bags of crisps and  eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I'd sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d's medical needs, I was rather hoping my pm tutee would cancel, but she didn't. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D's bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I'm finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week's episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice. I'm nibbling on dark chocolate and raspberry coated almonds which I bulk ordered online as a nutrition dense snack to help push my intake up after my long runs.  Tomorrow I am hoping for a proper restful day. All my children may make it out of the house (d has improved as the day has gone on and hopes to make it back to school tomorrow) and I may even get chance to paint the bannisters!

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

lately, i feel like there's been a lot more pressure on here to show up a certain way, and while i try not to think too much about how i may appear to others, sometimes being in this space can feel confusing and intimidating.  some things that are important for me to remember are that at the end of the day, this account is for ME, i'm allowed to pick and choose what i want to post about, and this platform is a place for individual expression, so we are allowed to show up on here and choose to express ourselves however we want to whether that's using instagram as a public diary, an outlet to show a single side/passion of ours, or a place to simply keep a collection of our highlights or photos that we think look good.
——
instagram is not reality, and i also don't think it needs to be reality because we all live a life outside the realms of our phones and this app, so rather than trying to expect ourselves from others, i think it's our responsibility to take what we see on here with a grain of salt and mute, unfollow, and block anyone if what they post isn't what we want to see (that's part of the beauty of social media!). we are individuals who choose to come onto this app for individual reasons and to express ourselves in our individual ways, and we are all going through shit that other people don't see, so however you want to and choose to show up on here, i am here for it, and i support you 💫

 Daily reminder that you can do this. Recovery is not easy - in fact it's downright horrible sometimes. But even my worse days in recovery were nothing compared to my worse days with my eating disorder.  It's really difficult to stay on the recovery road, but you have to make sure you're not falling into all or nothing mentality. For example, you skip a meal one day. You might feel all it lost, or that you can't do this. You can. So you missed a meal, then just make sure that tomorrow you eat all your meals + extra. Get right back on track. You can do this. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 6307, distribution: 0.7714601576558588 ; Eating disorders are complex. Your age, gender, wealth, sexual orientation, body shape, race, religion, ethnicity - none of it matters. What we see on the outside does not correlate with what you feel on the inside. For this reason, we wanted to begin sharing your stories on our feed, highlight your journeys (highs and lows), and provide support to those who may be feeling the same way.

We're thrilled to kick this off with our staff member, McCall from Florida. Please visit her account, @mccalldempsey, to read the full story: “No Sunday Scaries here. But that wasn't always the case.

Ten years ago in my eating disorder, Sunday's were the absolute worst. They were the catastrophic downfall of my week's restriction turned to eating “normal” with friends and family on Friday and Saturday leading to binging and purging on Sunday.

I always thought it was Sunday's fault...my fault. If I could just “get my shit together” and not eat so much then I would be fine. Obviously, the issue wasn't that simple.

I had a severe mental illness that required professional and medical help. Nine years ago I finally received that help and through my hard work in recovery, Sunday's are no longer scary...they are simply amazing…”

I don't even know which bed I mean if I were to say "I can't wait to sleep in my own bed." This used to drive me insane, to literal tears of frustration and feeling lost because I couldn't find ONE spot to call "mine," or my "safe haven" "escape" "place of comfort," etc.

my problem wasn't that I couldn't find a place to call home, it was that I couldn't call my self home. Or I wouldn't call myself home. i didn't feel like I had a right to say that i was my own home. i didn't deem my own physical vessel worthy for my soul to rest. since coming back from my trip, I have started to feel more at home with myself than ever. It's funny how being away from home catapulted my straight into looking inward. Now it's okay that I don't know where my external home is because no matter where I go, I AM my home. I am the place I rest in. I am the love and comfort I need. I am enough- more than enough to house the infinite that is within me. Instead of looking outward, I fold inward and realize I am home. 📸: @ireneb

I have got a screening appointment to be in the covid vaccine trial, and of course they will weigh me. It hadn't occurred to me until now. After three months enforced scale-free-ness, I am about to be hit with the number. It could be a disaster if my brain turns on me and trips me up. Going by how my clothes fit, I am approximately the same size as when I last weighed. I think I have gained muscle over lockdown and so this may cause the number to be higher than it was. Some days I think I've gained a lot of fat too but other days I realise this is my brain playing tricks on me.  I feel strong and healthy and fit. No matter how the number on the scale has moved, I need to remember this. Plus of course the scales at the hospital and the scales at the gym could easily be calibrated a few pounds different to each other.  Agh and just in therapy this week I was working on this whole, I don't need to know the number to calm my anxiety about my body, and we were talking about retraining my brain to know that I am so many other more important things than my weight or size. And now that could all be about to be derailed. Eek.

Very rarely did the pictures or texts posts on here match the facts of the situations, and I feel sad that I thought a shiny facade would make what was going on around me/inside of me okay. Sometimes I did wake up and think “wow it's a gorgeous day here in the city and I'm going to the farmers' market and I'll make some pancakes beforehand and cut out little banana hearts and that will be a fun thing to do,” but that was honestly pretty rare, given the number of pancake pictures I posted where that was not the case at all. Sometimes instead I'd wake up from gnarly trauma nightmares and make cute-looking toast, with a very surface-level caption about how trauma can be tough but I GOT THIS I'm a survivor etc and also more importantly look at the strawberries I made into flowers! I never showed the bowls and bowls of cereal I would binge on at night, I never told you that I threw half of that breakfast away, and I certainly never said “this oatmeal was so pretty! Too bad I threw it up immediately afterwards!” Or I'd have horrific fights with my partners at the time and then make us brunch so I could take pictures of it and feel a sense of normalcy. I spent my rd birthday crying so hard I couldn't breathe, but you got pictures of me eating a lil vegan cake and some flowers in my hair. I told someone who asked me an anonymous questions that I “drink sometimes socially but never do drugs.” I spoke so lovingly of my relationships on here when those relationships were toxic and I was a terrible terrible girlfriend. I said I had bpd, but failed to mention the suicidal ideations or the impulsive and dangerous promiscuity or the self harm or the rage. I offered advice for people with depression that I needed but never followed. I only talked about relapses or their extent after they had happened. I understand why I did all of that, I do, and I'm working on not feeling shame about hiding the absolute wreck that was most of my life from yes my social media but from friends and family as well. I'm learning now that being messy is preferable to being dead. I definitely don't present as put together so much anymore. Still workin on it, the urge to smooth the edges is still very much there. But yeah. Things I've been thinking. Love you beans ♥️
Respect.Social medias (especially recovery based social media) makes it very hard to be honest and vulnerable. Its very foundation is to inspire and that causes the majority of recovery accounts to post fake happiness and fake success. It takes courage to admit it and it takes self awareness to even acknowledge it. Good for you. Being honest can be terrifying but its an important step to take in recovery. Its really nice and refreshing to see someone being real. We relate to real. I respect thatTake care.

 Tw! self harm Telling my mom was very hard. I have a very tight relationship with my mother so a part of me was scared of telling her because i didn't want her to be disappointed, but also, in México those topics aren't spoken about or we all have a very minimal and limited understanding of what an eating disorder is.  So, i've had spent a lot of time considering telling my family about my problem for a while now, since September, because of various factors: 
-I realised i had a problem 
-I was very tired of not being me 
-From September through December I've had lost A LOT of weigh, i was at my lowest and it made me uncomfortable. Losing weight was no longer euphoric 
Among others, but it was when i harmed myself for the first time and i got the balls to do it. 
 It was December th, and i was in my room eating dinner and I ate chips and omg, the feeling of disgust that washed over me was debilitating, I was full on crying, panicking, shaking, sweating, everything! It just sent me overboard, I was tired of everything, of being me, of being in this situation, of not being able to eat chips without this happening, i was tired of lying, of feeling tired /, of just living the worse version of my life. 

I went to the bathroom with my cutter, full on panicking, and made four slashes on my stomach it calmed me down, but then i just started crying even harder and i instinct was “tell your mom” and i ran out of my room before i could my mind could even react. 

I went to her room and she was getting ready to go out, and as soon as i enter and she saw me, she sat me down on her bed but i couldn't talk, I was just saying “i am so sorry, I am so sorry” over and over again, until she just sat there visibly concerned and slowly started getting the information out of me while trying to calm me down. 

That night I told her EVERYTHING, from how it started to that night. I don't know how long i talked for but i wanted to get everything out before, it was the first time in a while that my ed voice wasn't active so i just took advantage of it. 

It was really hard telling her, I wasn't explaining myself well and she was too stunned and concerned to have patience, but we made it work and at the end, i had erased the bookmarks about dieting and ed related things, my pinterest boards about exercised, agree I will start therapy and to put a firewall on my computer so i can't search certain words or enter certain websites (that was in my old computer). It might seem excessive but again i wanted to start as soon as possible, i was just so tired. 

And from that moment on, my recovery began! GOD, to think it will be two years soon is amazing to me, i can say that if I kept the rhythm I had, i wouldn't be here, at all. 
Recovery is fucking great!

remember that the life you are meant to live is meant to be lived by you

remember that you have all the tools within you

remember that you don't have to do this alone

remember that it is your birthright to be excited about each new day

remember that being human also means experiencing pleasant AND unpleasant emotions and we can still choose our default setting ❤️❤️❤️

Doc ID: 8662, distribution: 0.9667443528845305 ; 📣📣Neglecting your physical health is like playing life on hard mode.

We might not notice it at first, but you know the neglect catches up!

Prioritizing your physical well-being is the first step to unlocking the energy and clarity you need to find your true purpose.

Picture this: you finally have the energy to tackle that side hustle or passion project. 

You're waking up each day feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world. 

By investing in your physical health, you're laying the groundwork for success and fulfillment.

You don't have to navigate this journey alone.

You'll always have support to create a daily routine that supports your physical and spiritual well-being, so you can finally live a life that feels meaningful and purposeful. 

Trust me, you've got this.

I have a few spots available for my coaching program, Flourish with Purpose,  where women like you not only find their sacred mission but also set up a daily routine that supports their physical and spiritual well-being. 

DM me “PURPOSE” to get started!
