Doc ID: 14447, distribution: 0.980595915042609 ; Well, I felt good while I was running. I fuelled well beforehand, took some cliff blocks while I was on route, and made scrambled eggs on toast when I got in. Then I took a shower and couldn't stop yawning when I was done, as well as feeling pretty woozy. So I lay down and napped for  minutes. For the last  hours since then I've felt shocking, even though all I've done is sit on the sofa. I don't know if it's low blood pressure or low blood sugar but I've had to lie on my back with my legs propped up high on the back of the sofa, while eating cereal bars, to cover both bases.  Anyway, I've just eaten another meal and starting to feel better. I'm actually sitting up normally now! It feels quite ironic that I felt really good while running but so awful after I stopped. Maybe next time I need to eat more carbs when I get in, one piece of toast clearly wasn't enough. We live and learn eh?

Doc ID: 23899, distribution: 0.9804626023345414 ; Question: I hate that what's left of my ed still makes me get a little triggered when I see people in larger bodies.This sounds very cruel and just overall awful cause we shouldn't put each other in boxes based on body sizes but for some reason I can't help it. I'm trying to snap out of it every time it happens but it's just ed irrationality.I was wondering if you can relate on this one  Answer: eh generally im not triggered by it. i've always had overweight friends. my best friend is obese. ive always tried to be mindful of this one. and generally i dont feel any aversion to anyones body. but i will admit - if someone crosses me, wrongs me, disrespects me - usually strangers - and they're overweight. they'll hear it. and theyll suffer for it. the minute someone endangers my life or disrespects me i start swinging at the knees. kinda a defense mechanism. but i have been in a position where i've been triggered like this before and my (obese) friend was present. i caught myself mid-sentence cussing someone out, changing the word ‚Äúfat‚Äù to ‚Äúfag‚Äù. wasnt really a good save at all lol. and i dont use the word fag, especially to demean anyone. i was just tryna save his feelings because i know his weight bothers him and im just a loud mouth bitch. im not proud of myself but im learning to work out of it. another way i get triggered is when people eat my food. often, my boyfriend and his family will eat the food i bring for myself if it gets left out. (not even left out‚Ä¶ but like if its put away and within EYESHOT) they're all overweight and unhealthy and i get LIVID when they eat my food because they literally dont need it at all. theyre on diets to lose weight. im on a diet to gain. when your f*t ass takes food from someone who needs it without thinking twice, sorry but thatll make my mouth sound off. i can definitely relate. but yeah i would never look at someone minding their own business or struggling and think ‚Äúugh theyre disgusting‚Äù. im not disgusted by the body. im disgusted by greedy, grubby antics. and if you're overweight WITH grubby antics my natural response is to associate the two and call a person out for both. :/i agree it sounds cruel and awful but hey we're self aware and honest so that means one day we'll get past it.

 things this is not: - stereotypical - ideal ive been the perpetually tired fragile starving anorexic and guess what? its miserable. you cant function or even defend yourself. your ‚Äúdark eyes‚Äù are always strained and can never focus on anything. this is exceptionally dangerous when you have shit to do (like jobs and school) & have to drive yourself around ..  
 i started taking my health seriously when i got attacked by a grown man in the parking lot at my work. i stood no chance against him because i was a weak piece of shit. there is nothing to gain by becoming this girl besides death. 
 why do yal want your lives to become more difficult. if its DEATH you want, then just say its death that you want.

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7890, distribution: 1.0 ; i used to be terrified of my body.
.
what it looked like, what it didn't look like. what it could do, what it couldn't. what it wanted, what it needed‚Ä¶what i neglected to provide.
.
when i first began eating disorder recovery i had no clue how to talk to my body. for years, i pretended i didn't understand what it was asking for. hunger pangs were foreign. i trained myself to unlearn my body's own language.
.
my body is my house, and during this time i was petrified to return to it. each day was a step closer to the porch, then the door, then inside. every second inside that place felt like i was drowning. responsibility, so much of it. but it was my job to make this house a home, so i did.
.
i called my body back. years of damage had caused my hunger cues to nearly disappear. my mom would try to make meals for me. ‚Äúwhat are you craving?‚Äù. the question brought tears. anger. i simply didn't know. .
.
learning to intuitively listen to your body, like all things, takes time. i know my body needs something when it's all my mind can think about. where does the mind go when you let it wander? follow it there.
.
living intuitively means releasing external pressures from those around us. what society has told us not to do. are you hungry now? eat now. do you want a smoothie even if it's  degrees out? get the blender. did you wake up in the middle of the night with a brownie craving? have one and get back to sleep. the longer you try to silence your body, the stronger the craving will get. it will cripple you. .
.
it's daunting to let go of the rules you've created. but that's the the beauty of it; YOU created those rules, so YOU can break them. look internally if you seek what your body truly needs. it's there for you, it's begging you to listen.
.
so i ask you to ask yourself: .
.
what's it saying? üí´

Doc ID: 2102, distribution: 1.0 ; ceo-of-regulus-black-deactivate:Any tips on how to cope with being bloated after a meal? It always freaks me out despite it being completely normal.. 
For me I drink some warm tea and either lay down or do something distracting like play a videogame or watch a scary movie. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7838, distribution: 1.0 ; my eating disorder recovery was marked by insecurity. .

i was insecure because i was a sophomore in high school and smaller than my th grade sister. i only fit in one pair of kid's leggings, and my skin was pale paper that draped over bone. my eyes were empty black holes that led nowhere, not to a soul, not to a heart. to nothing at all.
.
i was insecure because i was a teenager that had to be monitored like an infant. my recovery called for healing on all fronts. the restoration of weight. the mending of mental health, paranoia, anxiety. i proved that i couldn't be trusted alone in my own company. and so i lost that privilege.
.
i was insecure because my parents made and monitored all of my meals. they rarely went out, fearful i'd capitalize on their absence. lock myself in their room. run through exercise DVD's for hours. when my mom did go out she'd tell my  y/o sister, ‚Äúkeep an eye on angie‚Äù. i was .
.
i was insecure because every nutrition label in our pantry was suffocated by colorful post-it notes- i couldn't be trusted around numbers. my sisters didn't have friends over for dinner- i was a basket case at the table. the kitchen was stripped of harmless tools like measuring cups, and the clock was covered while i ate so i couldn't time myself between bites. .
.

i was insecure because these acts, these needs‚Ä¶were those of a toddler, not a teenager. it was frustrating and scary and i felt trapped, as if i had regressed in time, in maturity.
.
but all discomfort is temporary. a part of me knew that i wouldn't be lost forever, but that i'd stay lost if i resisted.
.
our insecurities have as much power over us as we allow for. we're taught what to feel insecure about based on how closely we align with the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù. .

what we forget is that the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù won't always serve us. the steps i needed to take to recover weren't part of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù teenage life, but they are what gave me that life back.
.
insecurity is not a threat; it is an invitation to rise. my eating disorder recovery was marked by insecurity‚Ä¶at first. life got easier when i embraced the discomfort, worked through it. feeling insecure is normal, but it's not the end.
.
in fact, it's the beginning.

Doc ID: 11239, distribution: 1.0 ; Exciting times (well, mini exciting times) ... tomorrow I'm going to post my first little workout here on insta for you guys to see. It's going to be a set of four upper body exercises, so not very many, but I do them as supersets as I will explain in the caption, and my arms are shaking by the end of it (which you can see quite clearly in the videos) üòÇ

The reason why I want to start posting videos like this is to not only give you some workout inspiration, but also help you guys out if you've not used gym machines in the past. Before my brother started helping me out, I had no clue how to use any of the machines. I took a lot of time trialling different ones and getting the form right before I started putting together some mini-workouts. That way I could make sure I was isolating and working the right muscle, and just building my confidence using machines and weights in the gym (which can be a very male-dominated area üòÖ)! I'm hoping that I'll be able to explain how to use each machine correctly and what it should be doing. A lot of this knowledge is being channelled from @matt.j.white so big shout out to my not so little brother anymore (who actually turns  today üéâ). He also filmed all my videos and did a pretty good job üòè Watch this space people‚úåüèª

Doc ID: 8958, distribution: 1.0 ; September is national yoga awareness month! 

I thought I would share a few things that are integral to yoga, starting with the  limbs. The  limbs of yoga  are the bread and (vegan) butter to the teachings of yoga. They are steps that act as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. They serve as a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline. They direct attention to one's health and help us to acknowledge the more spiritual aspects of ourselves.

Notice how asana, or postures, is only one of the . Yoga is truly a lifestyle that encompasses mindfulness and love for others and the self. Read more about it in Patanjali's ‚ÄúYoga Sutra‚Äù! That's one of the books that are required in most yoga teacher training courses. 

Of course, I am just a baby in my yoga life so if you want to learn the true teachings of yoga (aka not just doing cool postures), my personal favorites for yoga wisdom are @larugayoga and @kinoyoga.

I'll be sharing more yoga infographics this month but we shall just start with this one :)

So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don't know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I've mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These  exercise I did for  minute each, and repeated the whole circuit  times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise  // Lat pull down //  minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise  // Seated chest fly //  minute
Keep your arms slightly bent and shoulder blades pinned back.
Exercise  // Flat chest press //  minute
Don't lock your elbows at the top, have a slight arch in your back and press your feet firmly against the ground. 
Exercise //  Low row //  minute
Pull your elbows in and back, and hold then the squeeze for a second or so to feel the burn.

two years ago i started coming to @tonehouse. after my first workout i cried and swore i would never go back. it was too hard, too much, too extreme. a challenge i couldn't handle. .
.
but i was back the next week, and then the next. and here we are two full years later. .

this place has shaped me into the athlete i am today. it's challenged me and pushed me and brought out the best in me. my tonehouse community is a family and second home.

I feel that way about ever attempt to better myself.. work out? Ed ruins it. Eat healthy? Ed ruins it. Eat more? Ed ruins it. Eat less? Ed ruins it. Drink more water? Ed ruins it. Every time I try to just be normal, Ed pushes it to the extreme in any direction and ruins it.I look normal. talking about it with people isnt really helpful.

And at home Im struggling to get anything going, because i hate it so much but i also am afraid if I give effort im going to overdo it like always. There's no balance. Its shitty no matter what I do so I tend to get ultra depressed and avoid it. bringing me back here, complaining I cant do anything right and help myself.

Doc ID: 7922, distribution: 1.0 ; i've never had good skin.
.
during my eating disorder,  my skin took an alarming hit. terribly dehydrated because i was afraid to drink water. pale and gray because i robbed my body of the nutrients it desperately needed.
.
during this time i also developed a rigorous case of anxiety. i was constantly paranoid, and to cope i would mindlessly pick at my skin. it was pain i could control...to mask the pain i couldn't. .
.
so now we have dry, pale, blistered and red skin.
.
even in good health, my skin has continued to be an issue. it seems like no matter what i do i'm constantly red, dry‚Ä¶something.
.
and then, it happened. my solution fell into my lap (mailbox).
.
last month my generous friend @daninemeh sent me some goodies. in the package she included the chlorophyll face mask by @cocokindskincare. i had never used anything from this brand but decided to try it out.
.
not to be dramatic, but this mask changed my life. it's super delicate so i use it every night (or in the morning if i have time)! after about  weeks of using, i saw tremendous changes in my skin. it was glowing, it was clear‚Ä¶and it was staying this way. coco, thank you for your magic!
.
this is in no way sponsored by any brand mentioned below. i've just gotten a lot of interest in my skin routine and this has been such a pivotal component for me!
.
to give a quick run down of my routine and other products...
- i was my face with @cerave skin renewing facial cleanser right when i wake up
- after wearing makeup for the day, i use a makeup wipe to remove it. then i wash my face again with this wash, and then use the @cerave hydrating micellar water to really make sure its all gone. then i use the cocokind mask!
- after i wash off the mask i use the cerave skin renewing night cream
.
as far as daily makeup goes, i usually wear a light base of foundation, some blush, and just curl my eyelashes. mascara if i HAVE to, but i hate taking that ish off üò™ i also drink a ton of water and that has helped! i have a @healthyhumanlife  oz water bottle that i refill -x a day! if you have any questions drop them below babies üí´

Do I regret cutting my own hair? Well, my initial thoughts are to say, yes . . . I didn't want it to end up this short again, because I think I preferred it a tad longer when I could still tie it up easily without having to use a band to keep it all off my face. My one-cut job also meant that it had to be feathered at the front when my dude fixed it.

H O W E V E R. I really dislike the thought of living with regrets. It's just not worth it. I don't know why I decided to pick up a pair of scissors and chop off my hair that day, but I did, and I can't change it. Hair grows, get over it Holly.

Doc ID: 15506, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: The caffeine all my daughters still live at home and on tumblr I always refer to my husband as H (for husband!).d's name was our favourite girls name at the time. d was going to be called Esme until we made good friends with a couple with a baby called Esme right when we were pregnant, so she got her intended middle name as a first name instead. And d got named after a little girl who was at daycare with d whose name we had never heard before but we loved it as soon as we heard it. (Annoyingly, my cousin had a baby  years later and gave her the same name, which is terribly confusing for my poor Grandma who now has two great-grandchildren with the same name)We would have been happy with sons but we didn't keep trying in the hope that we'd get a boy. I love having  girls. If we'd had boys they'd have been named Caleb (d and d) and Levi (d).

Doc ID: 12292, distribution: 1.0 ; This was a pretty big weekend for me: I finished my conversion to reform Judaism and am officially Jewish!¬†  I took the Hebrew names Miriam Ziva: Miriam as a symbol of music and celebrating freedom, and Ziva for light  radiance.  Names are very important to me. When I moved out of my parent's home  yrs ago, I started going by my middle name, Lindsay, as a symbol of being my own and leaving behind the baggage of my legal first name. I'm wondering now if the use of new names is in order to accompany another identity shift.   I am Lindsay the Brave  always will be, but as of Friday, I am also Miriam Ziva.

You are welcome to use any of those names to refer to me (though I love nicknames: Linds / Miri / Ziv).¬†   I would welcome thoughts on incorporating these names into my life!¬†

Topic 11 : 
top terms: houses, house, the, uk, neighbours, we, our, answer, are, question
Doc ID: 14507, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: We do have semi-attached homes in the US called duplexes, but they're not terribly common and typically in lower income areas (in my experience at least). They are typically rentals as well, owned by one landlord and rented out to two people. How do you go about making shared repairs on the house with your neighbor (for example the roof)? Also what is a loft conversion? Answer: Each house is just responsible for their bit, so if our roof needed repairing we'd just do our side. If it affects both houses, we'd have to negotiate with our neighbours what to do, but usually we just take care of our own side.A loft conversion is when the top space of the house under the roof is converted from a dusty random space (often with a trapdoor for access and maybe used for storage) into usable rooms. We have a big bedroom and an en suite bathroom up here and it's lovely. It's generally cheaper than moving to a bigger house to get more space. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16973, distribution: 1.0 ; The house next to us is for sale and there's lots of viewings today. Parking is really difficult on our road so we want some people without a car to move in. We're being very nosey checking out all our potential new neighbours. H came home and I fake-shouted at him on the doorstep for taking my parking space üòÇ in the hope of putting off the car owners. To be honest, if we could think of a way to join their house to our house, we'd seriously consider buying it. But we are one side of a semi and they are the near side of the next door semi, so short of a first floor sky bridge it doesn't seem very possible. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14487, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: wait where are the mailboxes??  Answer: We don't have separate outside mailboxes in the UK. We have a letterbox on the door and the post drops straight into the house 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14488, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: are bungalows flats? and are bungalows and flats like our apartments or studios?  Answer: Left: bungalow (one storey house)Right: flats (several storeys but each floor is one home)I don't know the difference between an apartment and a studio. Apartments in the UK is basically another word for upmarket flats. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14495, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Also! The same street can have LOADS of different house types because they've developed organically over time not been built as one entity. My road has ish houses and we have a few different styles terraces, a few detached, some semis, a small block of flats, etc. All look completely different  Answer: Yep. My road is terraces for the first half of the street, then semis for the second half and at the end are a couple of small blocks of flats. The problem my road has is there's not enough parking as so many houses have two cars, but there's only space for about . cars to park on the road outside each house. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14496, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: It's important to note the uk has way less surface area than the us. Houses have to be close and yep we tend to build up and not out because there isn't loads of space especially in towns and cities. Loft conversions get you a whole extra floor of space! Also a lot of our housing stock is old eg Victorian terraces which were built for factory workers before people had a lot of choice about where they lived and no way to demand bigger/better housing. It's not worth knocking down massive portions of towns or cities so we just improve it as best we can  Answer: Thanks anon! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14498, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Where are houses attached to each other in the UK? In my experience in my metropolitan area, duplexes are common for older individuals who don't feel comfortable living in regular sized houses (or want a smaller space), people who have disabilities, and families with young children. Answer: We call them semi-detached (or terraced) and they're just all over the place. A really standard way to live.When people want a smaller space, they may downsize to a bungalow - that only has a ground floor and no stairs. Ironically, bungalows are generally detached because they're often newer one-off builds built by people on spare bits of land.

Doc ID: 14508, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Blow their minds, tell them about terraces!!! Answer: I give you‚Ä¶.Terraced houses. Joined together on both sides!! This is the true classic UK housing ‚Äútwo up two down‚Äù ie two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs.  (Btw you can spot the individual houses here by the front doors)Some terraced houses are actually quite big though - I lived in one as a student that had five bedrooms over three floors 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14484, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Aaaand - because I'm loving this cross-cultural sharing: In the UK we use the term duplex for a flat (apartment) that includes two floors of accommodation, joined by an internal staircase. And three floors (uncommon) can be referred to as a triplex. And there's also maisonettes... Answer: This is getting into the realms of specialist housing blogs now. No more!! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14511, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Are you able to share how you and your neighbors have attached houses? Answer: I'm guessing you're not from the UK üòä Semi-detached houses are a very standard way of housing here. Houses are in pairs all down the street. Here's an example image from google (not my house) that's an example. On my road we don't have drives or garages, so we just have to park on the road outside the house.
