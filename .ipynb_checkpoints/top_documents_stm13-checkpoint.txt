Topic 1 : 
top terms: therapy, felt, bit, maybe, talk, thought, tell, therapist, end, away
Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.6661056752746395 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14500, distribution: 0.6614464979568789 ; Therapy .. // part one // and freeeeze…..  I can't remember now how T introduced the subject. Usually she asks me “So, where to today?” or something similar. Today I think she said something like “I wanted to ask you a question” or “Can I ask you something?”. Anytime she says something like that, I immediately feel anxious. Something slightly out of the ordinary puts me on high alert. I nodded though that she could ask me, so she said “How do you feel therapy is going?”  She must have seen the look of fear that crossed my face, because she immediately followed up with “That's not a trick question. I'm not expecting any particular answer” and several other reassuring phrases. Then she said that she did have a few thoughts on it herself, but she would tell me them in a minute. I thought she might be referring to what I'd said last week, when I said I felt like therapy was running away with me and I keep not getting round to finishing talking about a subject before something else took over. I repeated those thoughts, and then T started to tell me what she'd obviously been waiting to say but couldn't until she'd done this sort of fake lead-in. It feels fake because I think she was only asking my thoughts so she could then tell me her thoughts. I'm not sure she really listened to my answer. Then she said that she had been thinking about therapy, and about how it was progressing, and where it was going. Very quickly, she added “I'm not talking about us ending, I'm not saying I think we should end. But I know you have brought the subject of ending up once or twice, so I know it's there in the back of your mind too.” I'm looking at her very suspiciously by this point, sitting very still with one hand curled up in front of my mouth.  She continued “When you started therapy, it was like I had to take you by the hand and lead you, like a small child. Then gradually you grew, so it was like we were walking along side by side, like you were a teenager or young adult. And now it feels like you have grown more and you are going ahead of me, and I need to step back and let you lead the way.” She finished speaking and I just sat, frozen, with my hand up over my mouth. I sat like that for what felt like a long time, and T sat in silence with me. Maybe she had asked me my thoughts on it when she'd finished speaking, I can't remember. I'd gone off into freeze mode. My brain heard her talk about endings and growing up and leading the way, and I hate it. I hate it all. I don't want it. I want to just carry on as we are doing. What's wrong with how it is? It's just fine. Just stop saying all this stuff. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14759, distribution: 0.6580290146558935 ; Question: How did you pick your therapist? What do you do for talking about problems you would usually address with them during your breaks from seeing them? Answer: faithhopeloveandtherapy:
I didn't pick her. I've told the story a few times on here in the past, but basically my friends staged a bit of an intervention and made me an appointment with her. They knew her because we all went to the same church, although I had not ever met her when I started therapy with her.Oops realised I forgot to answer the second question. These days we aren't really dealing with day to day problems in therapy, more digging into the past to make sense of things, and I'm much better at emotional regulation now so things that would have sent me into a spin in the past during breaks, now I can cope with.But in previous years when we were on a break, T said I could email her up to once a day. She didn't reply but she was ok with me sending them. I never did email once a day but I do remember a Christmas break where I emailed her a lot. Also sometimes I journal or message with friends as a way to deal with that stuff, and use my coping skills or think about “what would T say?” and listen to my internalised T voice. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16349, distribution: 0.6393736040030116 ; Therapy .. // ending talk // part two  Then T said “but you brought up last week that you had been thinking about ending therapy….” I haltingly explained my thought processes around that. Mostly thoughts that ending therapy is a necessity at some point and that I want the ending to be well managed and enough time to do it properly, not have it forced upon us by external circumstances. I said that I hadn't intended to say it last week but I felt like after T had brought it up, I felt like I had to say it because if I waited till this week to say it, it would seem like I was just saying it sort of as a defence to what T had said. T said I was making good progress, some big leaps, in therapy and if I wasn't making any progress, she would be suggesting we finish. But I am making progress. I was thinking, are you talking me out of finishing? It felt a bit like that, even though she said “I'm not saying that I think we should finish this year or that we shouldn't finish next year” I do trust that she works very ethically and she has supervision, so I don't think she would talk me into staying as a client if she didn't think it was best for me. I asked “but how do you know when you're ready to end?” T said “Hmm I think you just know” I said “Yes but when we have a foster baby, imagine if there was a family all ready to adopt them and social care said to us, when will you be ready to say goodbye, what date would you like the move to be? I would say never. I'd never be ready. It feels like that with therapy.“ I said “On the other hand, I'm never going to know if I can cope with stuff, the stuff that will inevitably happen, without therapy, until I actually try it.” T agreed with me and talked again about how when we felt like the time was right, we could cut down therapy sessions, first to every fortnight for a while, and then to once a month. So we would have time to see how I coped without therapy in those in between times and get used to managing things myself. T said “Maybe you need to hear that this is about a relationship, for both of us. That we will both grieve it when it's ended. To do long term therapy, it has to become a relationship. We have a meaningful relationship and there will be a time of grieving when it's over.” We had lots of eye contact and I felt our good connection while she was saying this. After she'd said it, we sat quietly for a few moments. “How does it feel in your body right now?” T asked. Ugh I can't answer that. I scanned my body but there was nothing in particular there. I felt sad but it all seemed to be in my head. T said she felt a tightness in her chest and throat, like you might feel when you were sad. Even with her prompting I couldn't answer her question though. Eventually I told her “That's a too-hard question”. We sat quietly again. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16064, distribution: 0.63831418288366 ; Therapy .. // part  // emotional energy  T found the list I'd sent her on her phone of what I wanted to be different in my relationship with H. She asked which bit of it I wanted to talk about. I said I wasn't sure if I really felt like talking about any of it right now. T suggested we try and push through that feeling, unless I wanted to talk about a different topic.  “I think… we were looking at this list last session before the break… and I'd forgotten - completely forgotten till we came to talk of scheduling right at the end - that I wouldn't see you the next week… and then I was all in the middle of stuff on the list but suddenly I wasn't going to see you…” “Yes, it all felt a bit raw?” T asked “Yes, it was all left hanging. And I'd forgotten I wasn't going to see you last week, because I'd been too distracted about you being unexpectedly away during the week before and whether you were going to be back in time for my session. It was like I'd been looking back and I forgot to look forward…” I don't really know whether T got what it felt like for me when she unexpectedly went away. Or maybe she did get it, but she had forgotten about the little exchange we had about it. Which is maybe understandable because maybe it was a family emergency and she has been caught up in dealing with it and has understandably forgotten some of the details of what went on with my therapy before hand. I still felt like she wasn't entirely on the ball this session.  We looked again at the list and I started talking about how ideally I would like to be able to share emotional stuff with H in the moment, without feeling lazy, guilty or demanding. As it is, I either only tell him when the crisis is all resolved and everything is neatly wrapped up, or when I have a massive meltdown to the point of not being able to function.  “When I'm all emotionally stressed out, in order to be able to share it with H, I need even more emotional energy. But if I'm all maxed out, I don't have any more emotional energy to use. So I just keep it to myself.” We talked about it for a bit but I can't remember now what we said. I think we might have run out of time at that point. T lightened up the conversation for a bit of grounding before we finished. I got talking about a fostering course I am doing and we ended up going about  minutes over time, but only on chitchat not therapy (maybe that's not so bad?) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15233, distribution: 0.6229509486938873 ; No therapy this week  Tomorrow should be therapy day, but I opted to miss this week. We are on holiday and although since we do therapy by Skype, I can in theory do a session while away, I've opted not to. It's stressful being in a new place and trying to find somewhere private to Skype from when the rest of the family are around, and also not knowing if the WiFi will be good anough for a call. Also, T pointed out in session last week that if we were doing face to face therapy, we would have to cancel on a week when I was on holiday. (At this point, I asked her if she was seeing anyone face to face again yet, and she said she wasn't)  So, no therapy this week. I will probably send her a text though, just to make sure she doesn't forget me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16881, distribution: 0.6225230725988713 ; Me: *sits in silence* My therapist: have you got things going round in your mind, or has it gone blank? Me: yes I've got things going round, I just don't know if I want to say them My therapist: You don't want to say them because?… you've got something else you want to talk about? Or because they're not very comfortable to talk about? Me: yeah they're not very comfortable to talk about and I'm just not sure if I want to go there My therapist: They sound like exactly the things we need to talk about then Me: ugh 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17159, distribution: 0.6105873623595762 ; Therapy .. // separation   My head was not in therapy mode at the start of this session. I wasn't sure what to talk about. T brought up right away the end of the previous session where I'd said it felt like she was defending my mum, and that she'd apologised for that and knew that she didn't need to defend her.  I had to sit for a few moments and push myself to move into therapy mode, choose to dive back into it all. I took some breaths. Eventually I said “it just seems…. not fair” T asked me what didn't seem fair. She made a suggestion which I can't remember now, but she was off on the wrong lines. However even when she gets it wrong, in telling her that's not what I was thinking it usually helps me get going and tell her what I am thinking. I talked about how my mum was throughout my childhood years, from about my age -. Her dieting beliefs (which I thought were ubiquitous in the nineties until T disillusioned me of that), and how much they impacted me. I thought lots of my mum's beliefs and actions around food were normal, because as a child we soak up what our parents tell us and we don't yet have any beliefs of our own to weigh it against. So for my mum it was “just a dieting phase” yet for me it became my core beliefs around food. That's what's not fair. My mum got to move on from it and decide she didn't want to eat like that anymore, but I got stuck with it because I didn't know any other way to eat.  I talked about some of the other things my mum did that I struggle with now. I said I didn't think they were right and that she shouldn't have done them. T said I am becoming more separate from my mum now. “You are able to think about things differently to her, and have different opinions about things. You can think that she might have been wrong about some things. That's a big change from when we started therapy, when you would defend her on everything.” T was really pleased about it and said it was good progress. I felt in that mind-boggling place where my perspective on my life shifts a little. The ground moves underneath me a bit. For a child, you grow up thinking your childhood is “normal”. It's hard to detach from that and look back objectively and try and view it in a different way.  Suddenly we were nearly out of time. T reminded me that we had all the good things about my relationship with my mum safely put away so it wouldn't be contaminated by anything we talked about, and she said we had space for me to talk about being angry with my mum for as long as it took. “You'll know when you've worked through it because it will feel different.” We scheduled for next week, which was the week I thought she was away. But it turns out it's the week after she's away. Yay so I get to see her on Tuesday after all which is only five days away. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15283, distribution: 0.6065996446850539 ; Therapy break  I should have just finished my therapy session right now but no! There is no therapy this week because T is having a week off. Quite proud of myself actually for making it through the week without too much obsessing or wailing.  T is back next Tuesday so we will have a session, and then the Tuesday after we are away on holiday again so I haven't decided what I'm going to do about that session. When we talked about endings a few weeks ago, T made a note in her diary that we would revisit the topic in the session after the break. I am not too enthusiastic about that.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

We've been taught to pick ourselves apart from a young age… But the good news is that something you've learned is something you can unlearn too. 
We live in a society where we're made to believe that our appearance defines who we are, with impossible standards on our TVs, social media, movie screens, magazines, etc. It's been said that we see at least  media images per day. That's at least  opportunities in a day to compare yourself & not feel good enough. 
This is scary since the messages you consume become you. The beauty standards you see & put yourself around - whether online or in the real world - are the expectations you normalise for yourself. This is why it's so important to fill your social media feed with diverse & REAL people who leave you feeling better, instead of worse!

I no longer opt in to consuming only filtered, airbrushed, perfected, edited & posed highlight reels. 

The  images I consume now are from people doing their best & showing up as THEMSELVES… with cellulite, rolls, body hair, mental/physical illness, love handles, stretch marks, body fat, uneven b👀bs, scars, moles, visible veins (the list goes on). All of which are very real human things that a lot of us experience. It's made me more accepting of myself AND of others. While I don't always relate to every post I see on my social media feed, I also no longer have this unrealistic, unhealthy expectation for my body or life.

Now I feel kinder & more thankful for my body for what it does for me, rather than the way it looks. Trust me, it DOES make a difference! Leave a “🎄" below if you're with me!! Happy Real Me Monday! 🫶

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful.

The last decade has seen the rise of social media… It has pretty much taken over the lives of not only teenagers & adults, but younger kids too… I grew up being influenced mostly by TV, magazines, celebs, models, radio & my peers — & that did enough damage to my self-esteem — so it scares me to think about how harmful it can be to grow up today in an era of social media being accessible at your finger tips ON TOP of everything else in the media 😮‍💨 so that's why I post this series every Monday, to remind you of what's real & to gently nudge you to be kinder to yourself.

Several studies have suggested that social media exposure fosters body dissatisfaction & results in risky eating behaviour by broadcasting thinness ideals, comparison, perfection, food restriction, over-exercising & unrealistic beauty standards. And while I don't deny that I am in a thinner body myself, I'd never want to portray perfection the way I have felt pressured to in the past… I want to be a safe corner of the internet that shows up authentically & uses this platform to encourage you to be kinder to yourself 💛

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they're human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

I hope this series of 'what IG sees VS what IG doesn't' photos reminds you why you shouldn't compare yourself to people online! It's not fair on us to compare our natural, normal, everyday selves to the perfected, posed & edited versions of people online... We only see % of someone's life here on IG, so it's unfair to compare our % to someone else's highlighted % 🤯

When I first started this series I still worried that someone might see these photos of me and think, “Oh, she's not as pretty as I thought” but then I realised it LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER! That doesn't change or determine who I am, what path I'm on and how I make others feel — unless I let it. Being more accepting of yourself is a choice, CHOOSE to be kinder to yourself! 🤪 Anyway... All I hope for is that my Instagram can be a home for you to find comfort, confidence, acceptance, motivation & positivity.

Most of us know by now that the standard of beauty that we're subjected to — whether it's on the internet, on TV, in magazines & so on — is usually always perfected & manipulated. So it's hard to look in the mirror & accept what we see when all we see in ourselves is all the 'flaws', lumps, bumps, rolls, flab, cellulite, acne, stretch marks & scars that these 'beautiful' women DON'T have.

So I'm just going to leave a little bit of reality right here... because your body hears everything your mind says, so take care of it — it's the only place you have to live 🦋

This Real Me Monday series is something I've been posting every week for  months, but the reason I've started encouraging YOU to be part of this series with me is because I know I can't represent all body types... I know I can't possibly be the voice of all women. But all of you deserve to feel NORMAL (and even better, feel beautiful) in your skin.

Topic 4 :

Doc ID: 14709, distribution: 0.4399027197915765 ; I bought d this jigsaw for Christmas. She did it and broke it up and now I've done it too. It was a pretty quick one to do but really lovely.  I followed the example of a puzzler I follow on Instagram, where instead of starting with the edge pieces, I sorted all the pieces into piles of colours. Then I put them together, filled in the pieces around them, and did the edges last. It works for puzzles like this but I'm not sure it works so well for puzzles where you don't have big blocks of colour. It's an approach I'm going to practice though.

Another eight pairs of hands were delivered to the lab.” Dr Richard Shepherd, Unnatural Causes Really enjoying this rather grisly memoir of a forensic pathologist.

Learn to know your mutuals and followers ✨ Answer: Thanks for the tag @agirlcalledkatie  Here's a few things that currently make me happy in the these coronavirus times.. Getting into bed at the end of the day and ahhhhh relaxing. Waking up in the morning and sitting peacefully in bed with a cup of coffee gradually coming into consciousness, while H does baby duty for an hour. Finishing a PE with Joe session each morning. Managing to get my kitchen clean and tidy with all the surfaces wiped down (usually lasts about  minutes before someone comes in and messes it up but I enjoy it for the moment it's done). Four books on my kindle waiting to be read and a jigsaw half-done on my jigsaw board…. nice things to look forward to doing in quiet moments 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19580, distribution: 0.321281068073155 ; Question: What does your unit look like? Does it look like an actual hospital?  Answer: It doesn't really look like an actual hospital but it is less homey than other units I've seen. The patient rooms are much nicer and we don't have a ton of medical equipment around. I think it mostly looks like a hospital because of the fluorescent lights and giant nurses' station in the middle of the unit. The unit I'm on is newly renovated so it's very nice and modern but it's also more clean cut and sterile looking if that makes sense. The other short term unit at this hospital is older and looks less like a hospital than my unit.

I have no idea how to crochet though.By puzzles, do you mean jigsaw puzzles? I like any jigsaw puzzles…  pieces are my favourite. I'm not wild on olde-worlde pictures.

As for the hair pulling, I have trichotillomania, Ive had it for just over a decade. There are some things that are worth trying but the for sure way (for me personally) to stop the pulling is to Remove the hair so theres nothing left to pullTherapyIve had super short af hair in the past, and I do love it, but Ive worked hard to grow it out long. When its long I can put tinsel in it.. I dont pull from my head much anymore (yay), i pull from my brows and lashes (not yay). Been trying to grow my brows out under my bangs but every time i make progress i get trichy and destroy them again. Just gotta keep trying and also I gotta work on my stress and anxieties. High anxiety means lots of pulling. Idk man.. Maybe Ill put socks on my hands when I go to bed to prevent me from laying awake pulling lmao

If there's more than one item I usually eat one of each item first to assess which tastes the best then I have to eat them in order of least tasty to most. Really specific and random.   I kinda did this even before having an eating disorder lmao (I eat all the food in a meal together but eat less of what tastes the best so there's more left at the end)

Doc ID: 24625, distribution: 0.6318740208957262 ; Question: “A binge is when you feel out of control while eating” like honey.... no. The literal definition of binge: the consumption of large quantities of food in a short period of time.   Eating an apple or a salad isn't a binge. Eating more calories than you want to isn't a binge, that's overeating.  A binge is eating a large quality of food in a short period of time. You eating an extra leaf or two isn't a binge. Answer: preach babey go off on em ya hear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOH 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12934, distribution: 0.5668485018300128 ; stilldrowning: 

 One thing I'm really struggling with right now is food values vs. food rules. I honestly value good quality food, sustainable, local, seasonal, organic, that are more “whole foods” including a lot of home cooking. And I don't think “poor quality food” or processed foods fit in line with my values of how I want to live my life. On the other hand, I want to be able to eat all foods no matter what kind of food it is. So do I eat all the foods until my eating normalizes? Do I eat all foods forever? Do I go back to eating only foods that I think are “good foods?” I want to honor valuing good quality things but I don't want to be restrictive so I'm not sure what to do. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9750, distribution: 0.5612601420860774 ; contrary to popular belief, i strongly believe that binge eating disorder is also a disorder of restriction.

based on my personal experience, other people's testimonies, and the research literature analysis that i've done, frequent binge eating is very often a result of restriction, and it's essentially your body's survival tactic. if your body thinks that it's starving or going to starve, and there's food available everywhere around you it's going to instinctively want to eat everything (think: at the beginning of quarantine when everyone excessively stocked up in fear). it's not a lack of willpower, but rather, your body trying to help you. when guilt followed by restriction (even if it's mental restriction) occurs after a binge, this can cause a repeated cycle to occur. breaking out of this cycle isn't a matter of willpower around food, but rather a matter of breaking the restriction that leads to the binge eating.

i think there's a lot of stigma around binge eating-  according to @neda, binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder, yet in the recovery community on this platform, it seems to be the least talked about.  all disordered eating struggles are valid, and if you are struggling with binge eating, let me tell you that binge eating in and of itself is NOT a bad thing, so you don't deserve to let the fear, guilt, and anxiety of binge eating consume parts of your life.

give yourself permission to let go and move forward after a binge, be the supportive and empathetic friend to yourself that you have the power to be, and if you binge again, it doesn't mean you've failed, so keep going. the goal isn't to never over eat again, to even never binge eat again, or to control the way you eat at all because the more distant i get from my ED, the more i realize that the goal has never been about what or how i eat. the goal is to not let your eating control you, so that you can live your life to its fullest.

Doc ID: 15298, distribution: 0.5546539097271419 ; Question: Eating one piece of candy is not a binge. Let go of reframing it as a (even a subjective) binge tbh  Answer: I don't know if it's lost in UK/US translation but to me, calling an Easter egg “one piece of candy” is like calling a loaf of bread “one slice”. I have had big issues with bingeing and purging in the past so when I say a subjective binge, I mean my brain moves into that compulsive out-of-control mindless-eating “binge mode” that still lurks in the back, where if I don't manage to interrupt it, it will be an objective binge not just a subjective one. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17186, distribution: 0.5538916692942868 ; Question: How do u count the calories for when u chew and spit food? I always count half of the actual item as if I swallowed it, just  be on the safe side but im curious  know what others do! I used  count the whole thing but im trying  reduce my obsessive counting (: Answer: I don't count calories.You definitely absorb some of the calories through the lining of your mouth though when you chew and spit. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 13617, distribution: 0.5369249172671854 ; the issue with never really knowing how much is the correct amount to eat and developing disordered eating patterns out of that is that once you switch your diet to more nutrient dense foods you have no idea how many calories is in everything because its all such new food to you and you know that if you learn the calories, you'll freak out and restrict really bad again, but then you have no idea if you're over eating either having to eat to survive is a nightmare 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17150, distribution: 0.5368473510131113 ; Question: wdym most women engage in disordered eating habits Answer: :
i mean that most women engage in disordered eating habits. what is unclear about that? how many women do you know who DON'T binge, purge, fast, restrict, go on diets including fad diets, go on cleanses including juice cleanses, count calories, count other things they can use as proxies for calories, count the calories they burn, peg their food intake to something other than hunger, use food to control their emotions, treat food as something they must earn and don't always deserve, exercise compulsively, restrict or eliminate certain food groups based on nutritional pseudoscience, categorize foods as good and bad, experience feelings of self loathing based on what they've eaten, or use their abstention from food and control of their bodies and therefore food intake to attain feelings of purity, transcendence, or fulfillment? don't try me.

Doc ID: 9417, distribution: 0.5000015588758278 ; slow healing is still healing. ugly healing is still healing. nonlinear healing is still healing.

healing is messy, and it's deeply personal. just because your journey doesn't look like anyone else's or isn't going the way you planned doesn't mean the work you're doing is any less significant or important.

Doc ID: 8994, distribution: 0.31744643807897377 ; When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce

You look for reasons it is not doing well

It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce.

Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person

But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce

Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience

No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding

If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change -Thich Nhat Hanh

Doc ID: 2480, distribution: 0.39348656412506355 ; I actually put off doing this solo date for so long because I was too scared to go for it… But I finally did it! I took myself to a skate rink for this week's solo date 😳

The whole reason I started taking myself on dates was to overcome my fears and build confidence… So why was I so afraid to go skating on my own? Was I afraid I'd fall over in front of strangers? That they'd judge me for being on my own? That I'd be the only adult still holding on to the safety bars around the rink? SO WHAT?! 

The fear of failure, of not fitting in, of being judged by others will ALWAYS hold us back, until we challenge ourselves to step outside of our comfort zone and ignore all of the outside noise.

I had the BEST time. I fell over. I laughed at myself. I practised and improved my skating. I made some friends. I complimented a talented stranger. It was a good time!!

I also took myself out to get some food afterwards — I tried a matcha latte & almond croissant for the first time & rated them both in this vid!

Then I pampered myself at @hausofhoneyofficial with a lash & brow glowup!! Yes I did indeed drive . hours for my appointment, because Maddie (owner of Haus of Honey) is the best in the biz! 😍 See the before & after at the end of this video 🙈

Overall, it was an absolute / day!!! A memory I never would've made if I let fear get in the way.

What's something you're afraid to do on your own & usually rely on others to do with you? Let me know in the comments below 🙊 I challenge you to go do that thing… SOLO!

But we'll circle back to that… Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters – That is the Child Prodigy.  We'll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).  All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let's be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.  And that become a problem for one asshole in particular…  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai's maniacal ego couldn't handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn't the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this…  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering  of the  Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).  Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.  Aang/Sokka/Katara's story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.  Now, let's talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.   Yes, of course I'm talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph's family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka's arm in environment where her bending couldn't help her “see”.  Toph's story is a foil to Azula's, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph's story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.         Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we'll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara's potential and Sokka's genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many  yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka's character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season. Not to mention that because he wasn't a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can't be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations' actions.  Toph's anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn't as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.  While Toph's talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka's wasn't acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you're thinking. Zuko wasn't a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn't catch up with Azula's until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).  Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It's possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).  As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another's talent it's quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.  This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko's early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy's cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  “Azula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born”  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we've covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It's well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We'll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.  When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras' and other Avatars' lives.  . She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other  elements, buy also many things about the  other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naiveté about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. .  She was trained and mastered  of the elements by the time she was . Most Avatars don't know they have this power until they reach  and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra's natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang's, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep. she lacked restraint. I'm not saying her bending isn't great, but rather because it is so great it's her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naiveté of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.   Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through  seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend  elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?  It's a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.   Unlike Toph's parents, Iroh worried over Zuko's well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn't want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn't a prodigy like his sister.  And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.

Doc ID: 16027, distribution: 0.39176017609546077 ; Basic Tenets of Attachment Theory  . Attachment is an innate motivating force Throughout our entire lifespan from birth to death, humans are hardwired to attach to others. It is not a childhood trait we outgrow, rather it is an innate part of being human. . Secure dependence complements autonomy There is no such thing as complete independence from others. There is only effective and ineffective dependency. Effective dependence fosters autonomy and self-confidence, so the more securely connected we are, the more separate and different we can be free to be.  . Attachment offers a safe haven Predictable physical and emotional connection from an attachment figure calms the nervous system. Positive attachments create a safe haven which offers a buffer against the effects of stress and uncertainty as we face the world and provides the optimal environment for growth. . Attachment offers a secure base This positive sense of self coming from a secure connection creates a secure base from which we can explore the world, take risks and develop a sense of competence and autonomy. Having a positive sense of self makes us more able to make more successful bids for connection with others. We come to believe that the world is safe and manageable. . Accessibility and responsiveness build bonds Accessibility, responsiveness and emotional engagement (A.R.E.) are the building blocks of attachment bonds. In other words, we are asking our attachment figures “Are you there for me?” . Fear and uncertainty activate attachment needs When we are upset by difficult events or negative aspects of life, or we feel insecure in the attachment bond itself our attachment needs for comfort and connection become compelling. They result in the activation of attachment behaviours such as proximity seeking. A sense of connection with an attachment figure is a primary inbuilt emotional regulation device. . The process of separation distress is predictable Separation distress arises when an attachment bond is threatened. If attachment behaviours fail to evoke contact and comfort from an attachment figure, a process of angry protest, clinging, depression and despair occurs, culminating in detachment. In secure attachment relationships, protest at inaccessibility is recognised and accepted. . A finite number of insecure forms of attachment can be identified If, growing up, people did not have attachment figures who responded to them sensitively, then they adapt one of three different strategies - anxious, avoidant or disorganised - in response to the question “Can I depend on you when I need you?” Anxious attachment is characterised by hypervigilence & neediness, whereas avoidant attachment is characterised by shutting down and avoiding emotional engagement. Disorganised attachment (called Fearful Avoidant in adults) occurs when a person has been traumatised by an attachment figure, which then causes a tremendous conflict as their source of comfort also becomes a source of fear. . Attachment involves working models of self and other Securely attached people are comfortable with closeness and the need for others.  They believe others will be dependable and responsive when needed. Their basic relationship strategy is to recognize the need for others and then congruently reach out. Each relationship impacts our working model and contributes to expectations and beliefs which we carry forward into future relationships. Adult-adult bonds are more reciprocal and less dependent on physical closeness. Just thinking about the attachment figure can calm the nervous system. . Isolation and loss are inherently traumatising Attachment theory explains why the trauma of deprivation, rejection and loss of attachment figures have such a big impact on us, our personality formation and our ability to handle stresses in life. Taken from “Attachment Theory in Practice” by Susan M Johnson

 nawaffs:  You're not too sensitive. you're not overreacting. if it hurts you, it hurts you 

 This is a very good and validating attitude to have, but also don't stop there. Its good to try and really pinpoint what about something upsets you, or why it upsets you, because you usually realize the thing you're actually upset about is a lot less obvious and a lot more complicated. I always like to say theres no such thing as an over reaction, you're just reacting to more things than you realize.

weight gain doesn't mean you need to change how you eat.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less beautiful.

weight gain doesn't mean you've “lost yourself”.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less healthy.

weight gain doesn't mean you can't still rock your favorite outfit.

weight gain doesn't mean you should be less confident.

weight gain doesn't mean you're any less worthy.

weight gain doesn't mean ANYTHING about the wonderful human you are.

weight gain really doesn't have any inherent meaning, and it's important to remember that our bodies are MEANT to change throughout the course of our lives. even if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, your actions, how you feel, and your quality of life matter a whole lot more than your weight does.

recently, i've gained weight, and you know what? i'm cool with that. i know it can feel a lot easier to know and be told than to truly believe, but you deserve to love yourself and accept yourself no matter how your body changes.

your body is the vessel to your soul. it WILL change, but your worth never will.

Doc ID: 14055, distribution: 0.4947144369165301 ; morsobaby:  You are not disgusting. You are not gross. You're not inherently dirty, unclean or contaminated. Even if you're physically unclean right now, that does not dimish your worth or respectability as a human being.  Your body is not “wrong” or “broken”, if it functions differently, or on a different level compared to other people. Each body is unique. Even if your body functions in ways that would be considered flawed or embarrassing by others, it does not and should not diminish your worth and respectability. You are lovable. You are enough. Even if you're too tired, or unable to upkeep yourself all the time. Even if your needs are considered an inconvenience by other people. You deserve to have your needs met. It's not a question of if. Regardless of your physical or mental state, you are not disgusting, revolting, shameful or gross. You are normal, acceptable, and lovable. You are human.

 Weight gain.  Yes. That thing.  Weight gain was and still is one the scariest things about recovery for me. But it's essential. Regardless of whether you are underweight or not, gaining weight is important.  Weight gain, aside from the physical benefits allows you to come to grips with the fact that . Bodies change many times throughout our lifetime . Weight gain is NOT always a bad thing . You are so much more than a number on the scale.  Going into recovery, the thought of weight gain was enough to scare away any motivation. And not gonna lie, some days when I step on the scale at the psych's and I see a higher number it can be hard. My first big weight jump, I cried. But I'm glad I've put on weight. For one, I'm not underweight and bony anymore, got my period back and now am not always cold. But aside from the bodily benefits, I'm glad my brain has become accustomed to weight gain and that now I can look at it from a much more logical and objective standpoint.  You are not defined by weight gain, or weight loss for that matter. When you become friends with someone, you aren't friends with them because they're skinny but because you like them and you like spending time with them.  Look at yourself in the same light. Be proud of your achievements and of your personality. Be proud of your kindness, generosity, sense of humour etc. weight gain is inevitable. And that's scary. But it's good.

Doc ID: 14737, distribution: 0.48577261950445005 ; I'd been at my parents for about an hour when I went up to their bathroom and weighed myself. I knew I would do this. I discussed it with T last therapy session. I said I wasn't sure it was a good idea but I was also pretty sure I was going to do it anyway. I haven't weighed myself since February this year and I have been lots more mentally healthier for it. In , I weighed myself every week for the year, and shared my weight with T. So I have a good comparison for how I feel and think weighing myself and not weighing myself. Not weighing myself leads to less obsessing, less thinking thinking about food and how it affects my weight, less body checking. T suggested I write down how I feel before weighing myself. So I wrote to myself: “When you stand on the weighing scales, your point of view may well shift, and you will find it hard to find these beliefs in yourself. Other beliefs may try and come crowding in. But these are what you genuinely believe now, so try and trust Past You that she was ok, more than ok, she is happy in this body. Weighing yourself now is just an observation, observing what your weight is in this place where you feel relaxed and ok about it. So you do not need to make any changes based on the number. It is just information. How you feel in yourself is more important, and weight is just a side note. Hold that thought and don't let your brain convince you that it's the other way round.” Then I wrote some beliefs: “I feel good in my body at this size. I like what my body can do. It's possible I'm even a little too bony. I can eat a variety of things and not controls exactly what I eat. I feel relaxed around food. I obsess about my weight much less. I am tentatively trusting my body that it will not gain weight the minute I stop tightly controlling my intake.” So. I weighed myself. My ed brain says it doesn't “really count” because it wasn't an early morning weight. But it will do. I am at the lower end of the range I feel comfortable with. Which I what I would have guessed I think, based on how I feel and my observations of my body. Conclusion. I am comfortable with my weight. No need to change anything. Further processing to follow later.

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.48392048496706724 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

@pizzeriavetri really good classic neapolitan style pizza. there's traditional flavors like margherita and pepperoni, but also some really unique flavors like the seasonal roasted lamb pizza. trust me, and order the spinach pizza here- onions, roasted garlic, mozzarella, ricotta fonduta, parmesan, and chili flakes on light yet chewy dough *chef's kiss*

@cheufishtown_nunu asian fusion ramen bar with a menu of asian inspired noodle bowls, soups, and small plates, sushi, and japanese-style pub food. great food and atmosphere. the scallion rangoons appetizer here is a must order!

@doubleknot_phl one of my all time favorite restaurants in philly that i find myself always wanting to go back to. really tasty sushi, pan-asian cuisine, and robotayaki enjoyed in an intimate underground izakaya atmosphere. a great spot for any occasion.

@charlie_was vegan restaurant serving creative plant-based small plates and excellent cocktails. my favorites were their espresso martini, ricotta, and silken tofu & mushroom ramen.

@grancaffelaquila i haven't gotten the chance to have a full dining experience here yet (although i've heard great things!), but i go just for their gelato, and it is phenomenal. my go-to flavor combo is pistachio + fondente, but i like to mix it up too, and you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors here.

Doc ID: 15778, distribution: 0.6848418483137615 ; Question: what about grilled cheese sandwiches?? do you guys make/eat those?? Answer: We make cheese-on-toast, which is toast with slices of cheese put on top and then grilled. Or we sometimes make cheese toasties, which is like a basic cheese sandwich that you can then put in a special bag that goes in the toaster to toast the bread and melt the cheese - or you can put it in a toastie maker machine. Is that similar to your grilled cheese sandwiches?
