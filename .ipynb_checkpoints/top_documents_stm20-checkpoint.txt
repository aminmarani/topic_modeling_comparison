#ad #NakanoRiceVinegars 

whipped sweet potatoes with crispy chickpeas

serves 2

sweet potatoes:
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled
2 tbsp. non-dairy butter
1 tbsp. full fat coconut milk
2 tbsp. @nakanoflavors Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
a pinch of sea salt

crispy chickpeas:
1 15-oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 tbsp. NAKANO Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
1 tbsp. olive oil
a pinch of sea salt

start by preparing the sweet potatoes, puncture the sweet potatoes using a knife, then transfer to a microwave-safe dish filled with an inch of water. place the sweet potatoes in the bowl, cover with a paper towel, and microwave for 10 minutes (flipping halfway through). while the sweet potatoes are steaming, prepare the chickpeas. drizzle the chickpeas with the rice vinegar, oil and sea salt and mix until thoroughly combined. transfer to your air fryer basket and cook at 400˚F for 12 minutes. while those are cooking, remove the potatoes from the microwave and mash with a fork. pour the butter, milk, vinegar, and salt over them and begin to whip using a hand mixer. this will take 3-5 minutes until the mixture is uniform and fluffy. transfer to a plating dish. remove the chickpeas from the air fryer and top the potatoes with them. feel free to add an extra pat of butter and a drizzle of the rice vinegar to finish.

Answer: Roast the butternut by cutting it in half lengthways, removing the seeds and brushing the cut sides with oil, then put it in the oven at 180°C till it’s all soft. Fry up a diced onion in a little oil, chop and add the butternut squash, one peeled chopped cooking apple, some chilli powder and some vegetable stock to cover, and simmer it all together for 20 minutes or so. Then blend.Alternatively, I also love butternut squash cooked up with sweet potato, red lentils and coconut milk and blended into soup. Or dice it and use it in a curry.

i loveeeeee cooking dinner with you guys 🥹 here’s some inspo for this week! save this just for the super easy high protein dressing alone— so so versatile! 

loaded veggie & feta green goddess quinoa bowls

details:

- some of the veggies here are roasted and some are steamed (just based my preference for each one). i start with the roasted veggies since these take the most time (zucchini tossed in olive oil and spices, roasted for 30-35 min at 375F. there’s also a green veggie burger on this same sheet baked the same way!)
- onto the steamed veggies— i love cauliflower and broccoli steamed more than i do roasted. i steam each one in the microwave with some spices. i do 2 min and 30 seconds for the broccoli and 4 minutes for the cauliflower. i use the green goddess seasoning form trader joe’s on these veggies
- while those are roasting, i toss canned artichoke hearts with green goddess seasoning— no need to prep these beyond that!
- next i make my classic hummus dressing with a green goddess twist. i steamed 1 cup of peas in the microwave for one minute before adding to the blender with a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!
- once the roasted veggies are done assemble your bowl with a greens base of choice, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, artichokes, green goddess dressing, quinoa, and feta of course
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don’t eat dairy! i’m mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

let’s just say i’m a HUGE fan now 🤪

this lemon pesto pasta salad is SUCH an easy and nourishing meal that’s super meal prep friendly. i make a big batch for quick meals throughout the week. details below!

vegan lemon pesto pasta salad

start by cooking your pasta according to the package. the one i used said to boil for 7 minutes, but i found 5 minutes to be perfect. this is a chickpea pasta by the way, which makes this dish high protein! once the noddles are done cooking, drain and rinse with cold water. add to a bowl and add the following:

- diced red onion
- diced green onion
- cucumber slices
- avocado chunks
- chopped parsley

toss everything together and then add in the vegan lemon pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in 1/4 cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for 2-3 days so feel free to make in large batches!

Doc ID: 8808, distribution: 0.9823667805328067 ; are you a chronic over-committer? 👀

maybe you’ve struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here’s what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don’t have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don’t show up 100% for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can’t do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else’s emotions (whew! that’s a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

when in your life has your “no” served you? share below!

YOU have to decide that you’re enough. you have to be honest with yourself.  you have to choose to see the good. you have to show up for you. you have to put in the WORK to grow and to create your happiness.

you are so worthy, and you are more than enough, but knowing and really believing in your self-worth and being as happy as you deserve is an inside job. i don’t always have it all together, but in this season of trials for me, i am choosing to keep moving forward. sending you all love and light on your journeys, xoxo 🤍✨

Doc ID: 9455, distribution: 0.971840680214256 ; i doubt myself pretty frequently.  in my career, on social media, in conversations, and in a lot of other aspects too.  i’ve come a long way from the times when i questioned my mere existence, but i still question my abilities, qualities, and knowledge quite a bit.

imposter syndrome is something i think almost everyone has experienced at some point, but that doesn’t mean that doubting yourself and your life needs to be accepted as the norm. sure, discomfort is a big part of growth, and the “fake it til you make it” mindset has its place, but believing in yourself is also one of the most powerful things you can do.

something i like to remind myself of when i feel consumed by thoughts of self doubt is that you can’t live your life fully, abundantly, and as your most authentic self if you are focusing on the things you lack.

you don’t have to know how everything’s going to work out to believe that it will, but constantly worrying for something bad to happen and focusing on what you don’t have is not the mindset that will lead to happiness, peace, and abundance.

reminders:
you are worthy.
you are capable.
you are enough.
you bring something unique to the table.
the world needs your light and contributions.
everything will be okay.

and there will be a time when you look back at these moments and feel proud for making it through ✨

Doc ID: 9827, distribution: 0.9691983997936438 ; someone else’s reality is never going to be the exact same as your own.
——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn’t mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there’s been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can’t expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
——
we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

Doc ID: 9702, distribution: 0.9654841010046691 ; self-love doesn’t mean that you always feel good about yourself.

self-love is recognizing and affirming yourself for who you really are.

self-love is accepting yourself however you show up on any given day.

self-love is honoring yourself and your body even when you don’t feel good.

self-love is being honest with yourself about where you’re at and what is really best for you.

self-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.

self-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.

self-love is knowing that your worth doesn’t change even when you do.

self-love is freedom, and being free is the best feeling in the world.

the past few months, my mental health has been rocky, and it’s honestly been really tough. i catch myself telling myself that once i feel better or things change, THEN life will be so much better and i’ll be happier. something i’m constantly reminding myself of is that in the midst of struggle, there can still be space for happiness. i don’t need to wait until i’m feeling better or in an easier stage of life to still seek out joy. i can want to change AND accept my current state. i can feel sad AND experience happiness. i can be healing AND be whole. duality exists, and it’s a beautiful thing.

so, bloom where you are planted. if you are struggling to see the light, don’t be afraid to be the light. you are exactly where you are meant to be, and beautiful things are on their way. after all, without rain, there would be no rainbows 🌷☀️🌈

my inner critic voice is loud today, but rather than letting it dictate my life and influence my actions, i’m choosing a new narrative to tell myself instead. gentle reminder that we are our biggest influence, and the way we speak to ourselves matters!

here are some affirmations that are working for me today and may be resonating with you too:

i am greater than the narrative my anxiety is creating in my head.

i matter, and i deserve to live a life of peace, joy, fulfillment, and love. i will let go of and separate myself from the things getting in the way of the life i deserve.

i am in control of how i show up, what i focus on, and how i respond.

i am enough. who i am is enough. what i do is enough. working on accepting and loving myself fully and unconditionally is how i take my power back.

i am ending 2020 feeling the most me ME i think i’ve ever felt, and i don’t think i would’ve felt this way if it wasn’t for all the unexpected and challenging events and circumstances we were all forced to face this year.

the past couple years, i’ve made my main intention ~letting go~, and this year was the year i was truly able to feel the internal shifts happening within me.

one of the hardest parts about letting go for me was that it can take longer (sometimes a lot longer) to let go of thoughts than it is of actions. just because i had stopped harmful behaviors didn’t mean i wasn’t fighting an internal battle that in many ways felt even harder and more painful than the initial fight to change my actions.

not enough people tell you that the healing often hurts a lot more than the breaking,

but the journey to feeling whole again,

to feeling like YOU again is worth it.

happy new year’s eve ✨ cheers to releasing expectations for what next year has in store, cheers to healing, and cheers to becoming all that we are meant to be! 🥂

Answer: What we call school is age 4-16. Primary school is 4-11 and secondary school is 11-16, culminating in national exams in about eight different subjects, called GCSEs. Age 17-18 is sixth form (more exams called A-levels, usually in three subjects) or college (a range of more vocational and practical courses), and then after that is university if you choose.A typical school day runs from 9-3.30pm, and the school year runs from September to July, with 2 weeks off at Christmas and 2 weeks off at Easter.

1 container @kitehill plain vegan greek yogurt
1 cup veggie broth
olive oil
sea salt
garlic powder

sauté the onion in a generous amount of olive oil over medium heat until soft. use more oil than you think you need because once thats browned add the kale and cook down until tender and fragrant. next add the broccoli florets and a splash of broth. cook for about 10 minutes or until florets or soft. add coconut milk, rest of the broth, yogurt, and spices and bring to a boil. once boil bring down to a simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes with constant stirring. add more broth if you think it’s looking dry! at the very end add the frozen peas and cook through until they’re warmed.

1 cup broccoli florets
1 bunch tuscan kale
1/2 bag frozen peas
1 can full fat coconut milk
1 container @kitehill plain vegan greek yogurt
1 cup veggie broth
olive oil
sea salt
garlic powder

sauté the onion in a generous amount of olive oil over medium heat until soft. use more oil than you think you need because once thats browned add the kale and cook down until tender and fragrant. next add the broccoli florets and a splash of broth. cook for about 10 minutes or until florets or soft. add coconut milk, rest of the broth, yogurt, and spices and bring to a boil. once boil bring down to a simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes with constant stirring. add more broth if you think it’s looking dry! at the very end add the frozen peas and cook through until they’re warmed.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it’s also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren’t enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don’t is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn’t brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can’t possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they’re someone’s very best photo, they’re the highlight of someone else’s life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it’s close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That’s why it’s so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

At first this series was about showing y’all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I’m here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we’re all human — there are plenty of ‘bad’ photos behind the 1 really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you’ll feel better about yourself hehehe.

Most of us have mastered certain poses that allow us to literally transform our bodies within seconds... Myself included. But this just goes to show that no matter how flawless we may look online, that’s just not the reality most of the time. Our lumps, bumps and rolls are normal and nothing to be ashamed of ⭐️

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It’s from their new Eclipse collection & I’ve been living in it 😍 [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled 24/7 either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I’m so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know 💛

Happy Real Me Monday 🦋 have the best week xo

Doc ID: 16512, distribution: 0.9833245477187694 ; Therapy 10.11.19 // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I’m just letting you know I’m going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can’t even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It’s like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it’s just agreeing the usual time and day, it’s a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I’m sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

Doc ID: 16185, distribution: 0.9833245477187694 ; Therapy 28.01.19 // screenshot 1 // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn’t really resonate. So I tried again. It’s kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren’t just being nice… like it’s there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That’s when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had 30 seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in 30 seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14454, distribution: 0.977130418249552 ; Therapy 23.02.21 // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week’s been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I’d been holding all week… and then I didn’t get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they’re falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn’t say that so I didn’t have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum’s facebook post and then I hadn’t had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn’t be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she’s saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It’s good to not get things wrong but it’s also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right??

Doc ID: 15026, distribution: 0.973425859316374 ; We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said “I think I need to talk about something else now” which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I’m not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. “Shall I ask you some questions then?” she said, and I nodded. She carried on “Hmm… ok… children… holidays… the baby… what shall we go with?… oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I’ve hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there…. So, what’s happening with her future?” I started telling T about the plans for the baby’s future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by 7 minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I’ve had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we’ve talked about, but this week I don’t seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it’s a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16905, distribution: 0.9732460558397613 ; Therapy 17/09/19  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can’t get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we’ll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn’t anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn’t say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter’s situation is completely separate to me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15248, distribution: 0.9732460558397613 ; Question: What do you consider ruptures in therapy? How often do you see your therapist? How long have you been in counseling? Answer: I see her once a week and I’ve been seeing her for 8 years now. A rupture is something that the therapist does that gets in the way of the therapy work progressing. It usually means she’s misattuned to me in some way. Sometimes it’s a small thing that’s quite easily repaired and sometimes it’s a bigger thing that takes more work to resolve. Ruptures and repairs are actually quite an important part of therapy, and also something that is a natural part of it because nobody is going to be 100% attuned all the time.

Answer: Aw thankyou , I’m touched that you’ve been thinking about us. No real updates though I do keep meaning to write a post on the subject. It came to a bit of a head before Christmas, which is when I wrote about it. And I got so many lovely helpful responses and replies and messages and then Christmas happened and I didn’t really get chance to respond to them. But thankyou so much to everyone who sent messages etc. I took everything you all said on board. Things seem to have quietened down on that front just now so we haven’t taken any further action, but I will try and write an update soon.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9697632122037053 ; Therapy 21.07.20 // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn’t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she’d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don’t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we’ve been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don’t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don’t say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that’s exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that’s likely what I’m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I’m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It’s what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I’m not ready to go there. “No! I’m just telling you that if you’re waiting for me to do it, I probably won’t.” “What I’m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we’ll have year from then to process our ending. I’m thinking we’ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you’ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that’s all very well, but I hope she knows I’m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can’t believe I’ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven’t really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I’m just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 16210, distribution: 0.9672474706169715 ; Question: As a therapist, it’s not about “how the therapist works” but how the parents work. I always follow the parents lead - so for some of my kiddos, that means we check in by phone monthly, some come into session when they are able/it feels helpful, and others I barely see. For the teenagers that have support from their parents and are dealing with stuff outside of that, it’s really up to the parent when/how they want to touch base. Some stay in the waiting room and others don’t! I don’t read into it Answer: Ok but how do you know what the parents lead is? Do they just rock up in session one and say ok therapist, I’m going to ring you up every month so you can give me an update? 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.9669143148243129 ; Therapy 08.09.20 // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I’d just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it’s really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn’t have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it’s been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you’re ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that’s hard for you to answer because you don’t know what I’m going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it’s so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it’s just what you’ve always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn’t sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 1627, distribution: 0.9244296277380196 ; Not sure why I have to say this for the literal 6th time but using ed recovery pro recovery or any kind of recovery tags on a blatantly triggering pro ed post doesnt redeem you for posting pro ed content. It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.

you do not have to be light and thin and ethereal delicacy
disappearing into a ghost of a girl

and when you feel your voice pressing against your throat
desperate to get out the words that lay at the center of your soul
in a world that demands your silence
I want you to yell at the top of your lungs
letting loose the storm that swirls inside of you
you were not meant to deny the pull of lifelifelife pulsing through your veins
you were not meant to exist on a steady diet of “I’m sorry”
apologizing for the very air you breathe
you were meant to stand proudly
walking as though you command the room
speaking as though your words drip diamonds
because my god
we need you
we need your voice, your mind, your raging, passionate heart
and when this world asks you to be less
I want you to yell back as loudly as you can

be unapologetic in your greed for life
you do not have to be light and thin and ethereal delicacy
disappearing into a ghost of a girl
I want you to be substance and weight and presence
and when you feel your voice pressing against your throat
desperate to get out the words that lay at the center of your soul
in a world that demands your silence
I want you to yell at the top of your lungs
letting loose the storm that swirls inside of you
you were not meant to deny the pull of lifelifelife pulsing through your veins
you were not meant to exist on a steady diet of “I’m sorry”
apologizing for the very air you breathe
you were meant to stand proudly
walking as though you command the room
speaking as though your words drip diamonds
because my god
we need you
we need your voice, your mind, your raging, passionate heart
and when this world asks you to be less
I want you to yell back as loudly as you can
NO - a letter to my daughter, L.H.
