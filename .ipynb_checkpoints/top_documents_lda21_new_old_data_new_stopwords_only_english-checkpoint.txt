She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

This session I looked around the room blankly and eventually pulled a helpless face at T, and she just raised her eyebrows back at me and smiled in a kind of carefully equally-helpless “yes, this is a dilemma isn't it?” I sighed and looked at my short page of notes and said “I'm trying to decide what order to say things in”. This is just a variation on things I say to try and get started. “Hmm ok. Well, you could start with the most difficult to get it out of the way, or you could build up to it and do it last but we might run out of time…” This is also just a variation on things T says in response to me trying to get started. I wish I could be someone who just sits down and start splurging their innermost thoughts. I seem to need  or  minutes for the emotional pressure to build up enough to get me speaking. I don't know whether there's any way to bypass this. I might bring it up next session. If nothing else, it will be a different way to start 🤷‍♀️

Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right??

Doc ID: 3290, distribution: 0.9788141280180133 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2966, distribution: 0.9779251091025775 ; We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said “I think I need to talk about something else now” which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I'm not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. “Shall I ask you some questions then?” she said, and I nodded. She carried on “Hmm… ok… children… holidays… the baby… what shall we go with?… oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I've hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there…. So, what's happening with her future?” I started telling T about the plans for the baby's future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by  minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I've had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we've talked about, but this week I don't seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it's a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits.

Doc ID: 4845, distribution: 0.9776821124354025 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Doc ID: 3115, distribution: 0.9711663132550746 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 4452, distribution: 0.9696293427059955 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

Doc ID: 2938, distribution: 0.9682175480864841 ; Question: How do you deal with talking about your mom and how she wasn't a great mother in therapy? I know you wrote about this before but my last session some very obvious abusive things my mom did came up and Idk how to go about talking about it especially without dissociating by time the session ends. It's so vulnerable to talk about and explore and the feelings are so conflicting and I just don't want to talk about it but I know I have to. I'd also really like to not shut down  Answer: We've approached the subject very slowly over weeks and weeks, just hinting at it or saying one or two little things, so that gradually I've been able to stay present with it. I think you have to be able to trust your therapist that they won't push you too far each session (while also being able to push you just enough at times).We've also taken the last - minutes of the session to “unwind” (that's what T calls it) but basically to ground and get back to the present, which has worked really well for me. Remember that you don't have to talk about it all at once in one go. You can just talk about one small part of it, dip in and then move on to talk about something else. For me it's felt really important to feel like T is on my side with this, before I've been able to be fully vulnerable with how I felt about my mum. So that's been gradually building up over recent session as well, me saying things and watching for her response, I'm quite hypervigilant anyway to how others are responding to me.I hope you find a way to talk about it with your therapist when you're ready!

Doc ID: 3805, distribution: 0.966668690644719 ; Therapy .. // a snippet  We were towards the end of therapy today and T was on a roll, talking talking talking about anger. Sometimes she gets like this, she says lots of really good and potentially helpful stuff but sometimes she gets carried away and misses the fact that I'm not quite with her. I was still processing something she'd said just previously which I was quite impacted by, and there she was going on and on about something that felt quite irrelevant. Eventually I burst out in frustration “Can you stop talking for a minute!” T stopped talking immediately and said “mm of course”. Then she said “Well done for telling me to stop…. I'm glad you could say that to me…..” (Sorry T sorry that was rude, thankyou for taking it so well) I was so shocked that I'd just cut her off like that. T probably thinks of it as progress. I sat in stunned silence for some minutes after, trying to get control of myself and cope with what I'd just said and also think about she'd said immediately before all of that, that had rather knocked my feet from under me.

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

i loveeeeee cooking dinner with you guys 🥹 here's some inspo for this week! save this just for the super easy high protein dressing alone— so so versatile! 

loaded veggie & feta green goddess quinoa bowls

details:

- some of the veggies here are roasted and some are steamed (just based my preference for each one). i start with the roasted veggies since these take the most time (zucchini tossed in olive oil and spices, roasted for - min at F. there's also a green veggie burger on this same sheet baked the same way!)
- onto the steamed veggies— i love cauliflower and broccoli steamed more than i do roasted. i steam each one in the microwave with some spices. i do  min and  seconds for the broccoli and  minutes for the cauliflower. i use the green goddess seasoning form trader joe's on these veggies
- while those are roasting, i toss canned artichoke hearts with green goddess seasoning— no need to prep these beyond that!
- next i make my classic hummus dressing with a green goddess twist. i steamed  cup of peas in the microwave for one minute before adding to the blender with a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!
- once the roasted veggies are done assemble your bowl with a greens base of choice, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, artichokes, green goddess dressing, quinoa, and feta of course
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It's from their new Eclipse collection & I've been living in it 😍 [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know 💛

Happy Real Me Monday 🦋 have the best week xo

Doc ID: 9421, distribution: 0.9892894492026997 ; real talk: i don't want to be a “content creator”. i don't want to have to constantly think about what to post or what to say. i just want to be a human being who lives her life and shares snippets of it along the way.

don't get me wrong—i love creating content. i love sharing my food, life, and thoughts on here. i love having a space where i feel safe to talk about my struggles and things i'm passionate about. i love interacting with this incredible community. i love feeling connected to you all.

as much as i love being here and am so grateful for each and every one of you who follow along and are a part of my life, in the current chapter of my life, i'm accepting that being on here in the same capacity i've been in the past isn't serving me in the same ways it used to. maybe you've already noticed some change in what and how often i've been posting, and maybe you haven't, but with big changes and moves happening in my life, the bulk of my time and energy has been needed to be focused elsewhere.

this doesn't mean that i'm leaving social media! it just means that this page, which honestly may not seem change that much to you, has a redefined purpose for me—to unapologetically share my life in ways that bring me joy and be a place where i don't feel obligated to come up with and pump out content when or be a “source of inspiration”.

if you need to hear it: it is okay to leave or take a break from something you love. it is okay for your priorities to change. your value is not determined by what or how much you do or create. how your life feels is more important than how it looks.

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

maybe you've struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here's what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don't have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don't show up % for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can't do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else's emotions (whew! that's a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

i thought there was a “correct” way to go through life because i was given guidelines by society and the people around me when the truth is, there is no “correct” way to go through a life that solely belongs to you.

you are the main character of your life, and you only live this life once. no matter how you live it, people will judge you and try to change you, but if you ignore your intuition and allow them to alter your path, you're going to end up being a distorted version of yourself living somebody else's life. your authentic self is so much more powerful than any other version of you, and finding your way back to yourself is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding journeys of your lifetime.

you deserve to live a really truly happy life, and to do that, you have to learn to let go because where energy goes, energy flows. letting go of anything can be really hard because how things already are may feel safe, and with most loss, there's a sense of grief that comes with it. but, i promise you that the things and people that only add negativity to your life are not worth holding onto, and there is so much life beyond what you're used to that will open up to you when you make the space for it.

in order to keep moving forward, we need to let go of the energy that is no longer meant for us and free ourselves from the chains that are holding us back. your life won't be empty, your life will be open, open to receiving more opportunities, building healthier relationships, creating positivity, receiving calm energy, and becoming fuller than it ever was before.

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't share about my hard days too. i've mentioned that i've been struggling a bit lately, and if i'm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.

if you need to hear it: you don't need to be your “best self” to be worthy and lovable. you are, have always been, and will always be enough.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

ingredients:

½ cup vegan butter (softened)
 cup granulated sugar
¼ cup molasses (i used date molasses)
pinch of salt
 cups oat flour
 ground ginger
 ground cinnamon
ground nutmeg
pinch of baking soda
¼ cup non-dairy milk

directions:

preheat the oven to F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. using a hand mixer, mix the butter and sugar until well combined, then add the molasses and mix again. once the batter is smooth, add the remaining ingredients and mix until just combined. using a cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and flatten each cookie just a bit. i sprinkled each cookie with sugar before baking for - minutes or until golden brown. let cool completely before enjoying!

🇩🇪 Vegan or not, you mustttt try the doughnuts from @brammibalsdonuts  😍

🇩🇪 And if you're there next year around the same time, go and either run in the Berlin City Nights event, just go and watch or visit the Irish pub nearby (I heard it was good 🙃👌🏻)

Doc ID: 7707, distribution: 0.9596187439644053 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I'm sad but also happy for her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9438, distribution: 0.9541545193187168 ; Admit day of inpatient has been pretty long. It started around am when I went in for ECT and I just ended up staying the rest of the day. I waited for a long time and then finally went back up to the unit I had been on. I'm glad to be back on the same unit bc I know the staff and the routine so it'll make adjusting much easier. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9612, distribution: 0.9541545193187168 ; Day  of inpatient was super boring. I got put back on level one so I couldn't go on the fresh air walks and I had to miss some groups. I slept for part of the day and just sat around for the rest of it. Overall, it was a pretty shitty day and I'm glad it's over. I hope tomorrow is better. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9751, distribution: 0.9508276175524585 ; Day  of inpatient was just okay. I got a one hour pass so I got to walk my dogs on the grounds. I slept most of the day so it wasn't very productive. I was supposed to see Dear Evan Hansen tonight but instead I'm in the hospital. I was really looking forward to going and I'm bummed I'm not there. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 10025, distribution: 0.9489762801788338 ; Today was pretty good! I slept well for the first time in a long time so that was nice. I tried to go to groups but I ended up napping through most of them. I played Pictionary with my friends and it was really fun. I'm starting ect tomorrow and I'm nervous. I hope it goes well. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7825, distribution: 0.9469800833641031 ; Day  of inpatient was bad. I got woken up early by my doctor and that put me in a bad mood. I was pretty anxious all day bc I had a pass with my parents. The pass went okay but I felt pretty crappy after. It was just a bad day. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7695, distribution: 0.9373565237226918 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I didn't sleep well last night so I took several naps throughout the day. I started tms today and that was interesting. It feels kinda weird and I got a headache after but it wasn't as bad as the headaches I got after ect. I ran into two friends who had been discharged but had appointments on campus and that was really nice. My two closest friends are leaving tomorrow and I'm sad about that. We've spent basically all day together for more than a month and we've gotten super close. I'm gonna miss them. It's hard to see everyone leave while I'm still stuck here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4803, distribution: 0.9371435765173961 ; Up in Cumbria for the weekend. Ran the local parkrun. The first time I ran this parkrun, I forgot my barcode. The second time (today) I forgot the route. So third time lucky eh 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7608, distribution: 0.9355803128397102 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I spent time with friends in the morning and then went to tms. I took a nap after tms and then went to some groups. I found out that my friend is leaving tomorrow and I'm sad. My anxiety is really bad right now and I'm not doing well. The rest of the day was good though. My doctor told me that I will be here for a long time and that's a bummer. It hasn't really hit me yet. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9976, distribution: 0.9355803128397102 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't very good. We had weights done in the morning and that put me in a bad morning mood. Then the staff started getting on my nerves because I wanted space and they wouldn't leave me alone. My friend is having a really hard time right now and I'm doing my best to support her. I have ect tomorrow and I'm dreading it bc I got a really bad headache last time.

Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.
