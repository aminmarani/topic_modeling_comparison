Doc ID: 2619, distribution: 0.9594708618961862 ; Are you afraid of eating higher calorie foods, untracked meals & weight gain? I used to be too... But let me explain why you shouldn't be üôà

Firstly, I want you to ask yourself  questions... 
‚ÄúWhat if I wake up in  years time a few kilos heavier than I am now?
Now ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat if I wake up in  years time still terrified of food?‚Äù 
Which is worse? ü§î

Secondly, high calorie / untracked meals DON'T equal weight gain. Eating at a caloric surplus consistently = weight gain. So let's just get that outta the way! üí™üèº

Significant weight changes don't happen overnight. It takes eating an excess of , calories on top of the amount of calories your body burns to gain a mere .kg of body weight which is usually distributed across your entire body... So no you won't wake up kgs heavier after overeating for a day or two. In fact, you really won't notice a physical difference at all!

When you do overeat, you may notice some initial temporary changes such as bloating & puffiness, but this is the body's natural response to receiving extra energy & it will go away after a few days! So don't go into a frenzy where you start punishing your body, eating less & working out more... Just ride the wave & give your body some time! ‚ú®

When you eat intuitively, it's normal for your physique & weight to fluctuate because you'll unintentionally overeat or under-eat sometimes, but so long as you're making healthy, balanced choices overall, it'll likely balance out in the end. If it doesn't & you end up seeing changes you're not % comfortable with, that's okay too!

Weight gain doesn't make you a failure, there's nothing wrong with fuelling & nourishing your body well! It doesn't happen overnight, just like weight loss doesn't happen overnight. So yes, you can tweak your eating habits slightly along the way to suit your goals, but there's so much more to life than counting calories & fearing weight gain. Trust your body & enjoy your life üíõ

This information is what has helped me have a more flexible & realistic approach to health & nutrition, so I hope it helps you too ü•∞

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.9485488976469165 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

Photos like these can only really reflect the changes that have happened externally, but the mental changes are where most of the magic happens üëáüèª

When I was obsessed with my weight, I experienced:
‚ùå period loss
‚ùå food guilt
‚ùå thinking about food all the time 
‚ùå weighing myself at least once a week 
‚ùå weighing all of my meals
‚ùå fear of dining out / eating anything I couldn't track
‚ùå ignoring my hunger cues
‚ùå fear of increasing my food intake
‚ùå seeing exercise as punishment & something I HAD to do
‚ùå fear of weight gain
‚ùå obsessive thoughts about my body & being slim
‚ùå fear of 'losing control'

When I started focusing on my overall health & living a more balanced lifestyle, I:
‚ú® recovered my cycle
‚ú® dine out at least once a week & order whatever I want from the menu ü§§
‚ú® maintain my physique while still enjoying the foods I love & crave!
‚ú® learned that weight gain only happens if you eat in a calorie surplus & significant weight changes don't happen in a week
‚ú® accept that my body WILL change & my weight will fluctuate
‚ú® listen to my hunger cues
‚ú® live my life without the all-consuming thoughts about food
‚ú® exercise in the ways I enjoy! If I don't feel like doing squats on leg day, I swap it out ‚ò∫Ô∏è
‚ú® stopped weighing my food & myself 
‚ú® increased my food intake from , cals to , very gradually over time ‚Äî at my own pace!
‚ú® feel so much more confident & FREE now

These changes didn't happen overnight, it takes time to 'rewire' your mindset. So please be patient with yourself. Don't rush your process, do it at your own pace! Whatever your goals are, remember that your physical AND mental health is a priority & can be maintained while you're working towards those goals! üíõ

P.s. I'm not saying that weight loss is a bad thing, but weight loss at the detriment of your health is. You don't need to 'punish' your body into a shape you'll love, it's possible to enjoy the process while working towards those goals!

Doc ID: 9387, distribution: 0.9336558037224708 ; CHEESIN' because pizza (and pretty much everything) ‚Äútastes better than skinny feels‚Äù.

this is not saying that being thin or losing weight is bad! but the phrase ‚Äúnothing tastes better than skinny feels‚Äù encourages and romanticizes disordered eating, and trying to reach or maintain a weight that is below where your body wants you to be (which is different for everyone) feels like crap. you might be cold a lot, isolate yourself from loved ones, have a hard time concentrating, be consumed by thoughts of food, and sacrifice your health- mentally and physically.

gaining weight and undergoing body changes is hard, but that doesn't mean it's bad, wrong, or unhealthy.  you deserve to live a full life and enjoy food without constantly worrying about how it's going to affect how you look‚Ä¶

if you gain weight from fixing your relationship with food, eating enough to satisfy you, and enjoying foods you love, then you were supposed to gain weight.

Doc ID: 9744, distribution: 0.9131303003590241 ; opposite action is something that when i committed to recovery and trying to rewire my brain, REALLY helped me combat my negative thoughts and stop labeling my actions.

essentially, opposite action means deliberately doing the opposite of your harmful emotional urge.

if i had the urge to run, i would choose to get closer.

if i had the urge to isolate myself, i would choose to reach out to someone.

if i had a thought telling me that i ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù eat the chocolate cupcake, even if i didn't know if i really wanted to eat it, i would choose to eat the cupcake anyway with the goal of taking away the power from the food and transferring the power back to myself by making the decision.

this helped me eventually change the thought process from thinking i ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù do something to thinking about if i do or don't WANT to do something.

initially, opposite action can feel really scary because it's literally going completely against what your thoughts want, but that's why it works. the more and more you do things that feel scary, the less scary they become, and the more you're able to actually tune into how you really feel and make the choice you really want.

Doc ID: 13379, distribution: 0.91288594107582 ; The best analogy for binge eating disorder (or my experience with it) that I've come up with is:  Eating is supposed to be like blinking or breathing. You need it to live, and it ought to be a process that our bodies automatically regulate for ourselves, eating appropriate portions and at appropriate times. But once I bring attention to or start focusing on the process (usual when I try to start counting calories to lose weight), then that automatic process is cut off‚Äìlike when you become aware of your breathing or blinking. Suddenly, you hyper aware of what you're doing, and the pressure to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù the process that should be automatic increases. I get stressed that I'm not eating properly, and that stress starts piling onto itself, until ultimately it culminates in a binge (I guess that's where the analogy falls apart‚ÄìI don't know what a blinking/breathing equivalent of a binge is‚Ä¶) Anytime I get binging under control, or when I have in the past, it's when my body starts listening to its own cues and eating appropriately. But then I start thinking that maybe I could eat a little less and this time I can have the willpower to lose weight appropriately. But then I become too aware of what I'm eating, and fall down a rabbit hole of scrutinizing everything I put into my mouth, and suddenly I'm back in the dark pit of binges. Even though I'm the one who brings attention to my eating patterns initially, I always end up wanting to go back to when eating was just a simple, automatic process. I miss my normal hunger cues and my non-calorie-calculator brain‚Ä¶

To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok üòè).

The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes üëèüèª please üëèüèª

We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push ü§® ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.

Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! üòÖYou cannot win with British people I'm afraid.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.97872173411279 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy‚Ä¶ I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born‚Ä¶ and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]‚Ä¶ and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9709145561027813 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 15058, distribution: 0.9705944914255942 ; Therapy .. // perspectives   T asked me how things were for d now she is temporarily home from university, so we chatted about that. T asked me if it brought things up for me, talking about d leaving home and going to university. I said I found myself thinking that d was so young, only just turned , to be trying to cope with university in the time of Covid. And then I caught myself thinking that by d's age, I'd been at university coping for a year and a bit - albeit not with Covid as well. T asked me what feelings it brought up. I paused. This is all a valid thing for us to talk about, but I'm not ready to move on to university years yet. I'm still processing the primary school years. This has happened before, T starts to take the conversation in a different direction to where I thought it was going to go. One time after I'd gone along with her line of questions and then got upset about using the time time to talk about that and her not picking up what we'd been talking about the previous session, she said to me ‚ÄúFaith this is your time, you can choose what we talk about‚Äù. It was empowering.  I learnt that I can redirect the conversation to what I want to talk about. For a people pleaser like me, who used to be too scared to state my own wants because I always felt like other peoples mattered more, this has been such an important lesson. So I said, ‚ÄúCould we come back to this topic later?‚Äù  T nodded, ‚ÄúOf course‚Ä¶ where would you like to go?‚Äù She always gives me a positive experience of expressing my own wants and needs. I love that.  I said something about going back to what we were talking about last session. I briefly got stuck inside my head, phrasing and rephrasing what to say. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ so I've been thinking about what we were talking about - about primary school. It feels hard to stay with this topic though‚Ä¶ part of me just wants to shut it down and say, ah never mind, we've talked about it enough. It was all a long time ago.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo part of you wants to shut it down‚Ä¶ that sounds like there's another part that wants to talk about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, part of me does want to talk about it. Like from a  year old perspective, there's bits of it that are hugely important. But from an adult perspective, those same things don't seem to really matter. I kind of go back and forth between those two perspectives.‚Äù 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.9704429954392588 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less ‚Äútraumatised‚Äù viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said ‚ÄúI'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today‚Äù which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said ‚ÄúCan I just talk about something else?‚Äù. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked ‚Äúwhat's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it‚Äù I replied.  T looked at me.‚ÄùYeah‚Ä¶. that's magical thinking. How would they know?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.‚Äù T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 0.9691432213176194 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  ‚ÄúWhere to today then?‚Äù I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. ‚ÄúSooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list‚Ä¶. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?‚Äù I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. ‚ÄúOk so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. so‚Ä¶ uh I just wanted to check in that‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ so I had this list we were talking about‚Ä¶ and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago‚Ä¶ and I guess I wanted to check that‚Ä¶. you know how we got here?‚Äù T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said ‚Äúhmm‚Ä¶ I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?‚Äù She thought a moment and said ‚ÄúMy recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you‚Ä¶. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions‚Ä¶. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?‚Äù I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said ‚ÄúEr, no.‚Äù T smiled. ‚ÄúOk, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.‚Äù T waited. ‚ÄúGo on! take the plunge‚Äù, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, ‚ÄúYes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -‚Äú  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  ‚Äú- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to ‚Äúmiss‚Äù each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.‚Äù  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said ‚ÄúUh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult‚Ä¶. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.‚Äù

Usually she asks me ‚ÄúSo, where to today?‚Äù or something similar. Today I think she said something like ‚ÄúI wanted to ask you a question‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù. Anytime she says something like that, I immediately feel anxious. Something slightly out of the ordinary puts me on high alert. I nodded though that she could ask me, so she said ‚ÄúHow do you feel therapy is going?‚Äù  She must have seen the look of fear that crossed my face, because she immediately followed up with ‚ÄúThat's not a trick question. I'm not expecting any particular answer‚Äù and several other reassuring phrases. Then she said that she did have a few thoughts on it herself, but she would tell me them in a minute. I thought she might be referring to what I'd said last week, when I said I felt like therapy was running away with me and I keep not getting round to finishing talking about a subject before something else took over. I repeated those thoughts, and then T started to tell me what she'd obviously been waiting to say but couldn't until she'd done this sort of fake lead-in. It feels fake because I think she was only asking my thoughts so she could then tell me her thoughts. I'm not sure she really listened to my answer. Then she said that she had been thinking about therapy, and about how it was progressing, and where it was going. Very quickly, she added ‚ÄúI'm not talking about us ending, I'm not saying I think we should end. But I know you have brought the subject of ending up once or twice, so I know it's there in the back of your mind too.‚Äù I'm looking at her very suspiciously by this point, sitting very still with one hand curled up in front of my mouth.  She continued ‚ÄúWhen you started therapy, it was like I had to take you by the hand and lead you, like a small child. Then gradually you grew, so it was like we were walking along side by side, like you were a teenager or young adult. And now it feels like you have grown more and you are going ahead of me, and I need to step back and let you lead the way.‚Äù She finished speaking and I just sat, frozen, with my hand up over my mouth. I sat like that for what felt like a long time, and T sat in silence with me. Maybe she had asked me my thoughts on it when she'd finished speaking, I can't remember. I'd gone off into freeze mode. My brain heard her talk about endings and growing up and leading the way, and I hate it. I hate it all. I don't want it. I want to just carry on as we are doing. What's wrong with how it is? It's just fine. Just stop saying all this stuff.

Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 0.9670547411218471 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. ‚ÄúUh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.‚Äù (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said ‚Äú‚Äù. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, ‚ÄúOh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown‚Ä¶.. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.‚Äù T sucked a breath in and said ‚ÄúOhhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.‚Äù I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. ‚ÄúWhen you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.‚Äù T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. ‚ÄúYou look like you're about to say something‚Äù T commented. ‚ÄúI'm deliberating whether to say it or not‚Äù I said, pulling a face. ‚ÄúGo on then, let's just say it‚Äù  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said ‚Äúok, sooo‚Ä¶ it was a blip‚Äù. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it.

Doc ID: 14545, distribution: 0.9666933526202833 ; Therapy .. // Jenga blocks and neural pathways  I remembered back to the many times similar situations had occurred when I was younger. My mum would push me towards my dad, I think she had some idea of encouraging the relationship, so she'd push us to do activities together. I would have a constant level of anxiety because I knew that one wrong move could lead to my dad shouting. (As I write this, I'm stuck between the idea I grew up with that this really was just normal because it was just how it was, and the separate adult thought now that this is so Not Normal - for a child to live in this constant anxiety state.) I still observe my mum doing the same thing with the grandchildren, pushing my dad and them together. It's left me with this ongoing expectation that people I go to for help will shout at me. I spent the first few years of therapy expecting that T would yell at me, I get in a state when I have to go to the doctors or dentist. T knows all that because she has had to talk me down many times. I also told her at some point early on that if she shouted at me in therapy, I was leaving. I summoned all my courage and told her ‚ÄúAs a child I didn't have a choice to leave, but now I do. I don't have to stay anymore.‚Äù I think that must have given T a big clue as to what state I was operating from most of the time. However, there has been progress because I told T about my broken tooth over Christmas and how my first thought had been to go to the dentist and get it checked out, and there wasn't any fear there in my decision. We had a little reminisce about some of my previous irrational beliefs about previous dentist appointments, and recognised how much progress I've made since then. That's when T brought up the jenga block neural pathway analogy. She said ‚ÄúThis is what you're doing! Taking a jenga block off the 'everyone's going to shout' neural pathway and placing it on the 'people are kind and want to help me' neural pathway that you're gradually building.‚Äù I nodded in agreement because that made sense, and then I said ‚ÄúRight but I'm ready to sort it all now, I'm ready to rearrange all my jenga blocks right now.‚Äù T laughed and said if only it worked like that. I rolled my eyes and said I wished it did and how did I speed it up? T smiled and said ‚ÄúAh it just happens in its own time if we keep doing the work.‚Äù  *sigh*

Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.9655600315632339 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.979349277143345 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of ‚Äúoh, they're human!‚Äù or ‚Äúyay, she looks like me!‚Äù And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw üå∏

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday üåª 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same üíñ

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! üòç | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Did you know that Dylan takes all of my 'Real Me Monday' photos? But would you also believe there was a solid FIVE years at the start of our relationship where I wouldn't let him see my body at all?¬†

At the time, it was so deeply engrained in me that I wasn't worthy of being seen or loved the way I was. I didn't want him to see that my body was soft instead of firm, that my legs were covered in cellulite, the way the loose skin on my tummy sagged when I bent over slightly or that my tummy was bigger than my chest.

The issue was never him, or anyone else, it was my own body image & all of the messages I'd taken as ‚Äúfact‚Äù over the years about what was acceptable & what wasn't.¬†

Dylan's always told me he loves me exactly the way I am, that he'll love me just as much when I'm wrinkly all over. But it doesn't matter how many people tell you you are something, because YOU have to believe it for it to have any merit.

Nobody else sees you the way YOU see you. The people who really love you will only see your body as the beautiful, ever-changing flesh sack that homes your soul.

It saddens me to think that for  years of my life, whether I was at my largest or smallest, I really believed that the real, unposed, relaxed, soft version of my body (in the above photos, on the right) were any different or less loveable than the posed, ‚Äúperfected‚Äù, sucked-in version of my body (on the left).

Remembering this time in my life is heartbreaking, but it's also a beautiful reminder‚Ä¶¬†
ü™û You are so much more than your body or the way that you look.¬†
üè° It is possible to create a better relationship with yourself so that you feel comfortable in your skin.
üíó You are not loved for your looks, you are loved for your heart.
üëã It's okay to let go of the beauty / body expectations we grow up around.
üíå Embracing your true self & being authentically you will inspire so many others around you without you even knowing it.
ü´Ç You (& your body) are already worthy of being seen & respected.

A ‚Äúbad body image‚Äù day can triggered by many things‚Ä¶ One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden‚Ä¶ üí• a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into ‚Äúfeeling slimmer‚Äù or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much üòÖ slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! ü§Ø (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)üåª

‚ÄúIf we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame‚Äù - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play‚Ä¶ Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you üíõ

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure‚Ä¶ 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their ‚Äúbest‚Äù
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying ‚ÄúYou are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were‚Äù so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today ü¶ã

Happy Real Me Monday! ü§ó Each of these photos were taken a few seconds apart. Both are me. Both are healthy. Both are good enough | ad

But that's not how I've always viewed myself. From  years old, I started viewing my body negatively. So these weekly reminders are for those girls like -year-old me who were desperate to see other women like them: unposed, unedited, someone REAL.

How old were you when you became aware of your body image? & how old are you now that you're focusing on improving your relationship with it? ü•∞

Here are some ideas that may help:
üå∑ over the years, your body will change, expand, roll, bulge, wrinkle, stretch, sag & grow. So learning to accept it now is a priority ü§ç
üå∑ move your body & nourish it well, because health is about how you treat your body, not how it appears externally
üå∑ avoid comparing yourself to other people. Her beauty doesn't take away from yours!
üå∑ see yourself as a whole person, not an imperfect body part
üå∑ practice positive self-talk ‚Äî remember, your brain is always looking to confirm what you tell it, so the more positivity you tell yourself, the more you'll seek & find it!
üå∑ consume content online that makes you feel good, not worse! 
üå∑ appreciate what your body does for you: it keeps you alive, takes you wherever you need to go, it FEELS, tastes, hears, sees & smells. It's the vessel you get to experience life in, but it's not WHO YOU ARE.

The more we see natural bodies, the more others will feel encouraged to embrace theirs too. I love when I see a woman with similar features to me because when I see her I think ‚ÄúHOT DANG she looks amazing WITH those features, not DESPITE them!‚Äù

Btw, the sets I'm wearing are from @parisandiofficial üòç how can I feel anything less than wonderful when my OOTD is as flattering as these? üëèüèª You can get % off storewide with the code BREE ü•≥

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER ü¶∏ 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently‚Ä¶
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems ‚ÄúInsta-worthy‚Äù or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a ‚Äúgood‚Äù photo & the right made a ‚Äúbad‚Äù one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens üí´

We've been taught to pick ourselves apart from a young age‚Ä¶ But the good news is that something you've learned is something you can unlearn too.‚Ä®
We live in a society where we're made to believe that our appearance defines who we are, with impossible standards on our TVs, social media, movie screens, magazines, etc. It's been said that we see at least  media images per day. That's at least  opportunities in a day to compare yourself & not feel good enough.‚Ä®
This is scary since the messages you consume become you. The beauty standards you see & put yourself around - whether online or in the real world - are the expectations you normalise for yourself. This is why it's so important to fill your social media feed with diverse & REAL people who leave you feeling better, instead of worse!

I no longer opt in to consuming only filtered, airbrushed, perfected, edited & posed highlight reels. 

The  images I consume now are from people doing their best & showing up as THEMSELVES‚Ä¶ with cellulite, rolls, body hair, mental/physical illness, love handles, stretch marks, body fat, uneven büëÄbs, scars, moles, visible veins (the list goes on). All of which are very real human things that a lot of us experience. It's made me more accepting of myself AND of others. While I don't always relate to every post I see on my social media feed, I also no longer have this unrealistic, unhealthy expectation for my body or life.

Now I feel kinder & more thankful for my body for what it does for me, rather than the way it looks. Trust me, it DOES make a difference! Leave a ‚ÄúüéÑ" below if you're with me!! Happy Real Me Monday! ü´∂‚Ä®

Did you know that your brain is always looking for evidence to confirm what you have told it? So if the story in your mind is ‚ÄúI'm not good enough‚Äù, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't. This is why we see our cellulite, rolls, bloating, stretch marks, pimples, wobbly skin, etc as a bad thing‚Ä¶ Because we've been hardwired to believe that from a young age, so our brains constantly put a magnifying glass over these parts of ourselves & make us believe we need work.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative thoughts & overly critical self-talk. But this is why positive affirmations, manifestation & law of attraction have become so popular‚Ä¶ Shifting your mindset & putting your energy into positive thoughts has the power to change your life.

The law of attraction is a philosophy suggesting that positive thoughts bring positive results into a person's life, while negative thoughts bring negative outcomes. Meanwhile, manifestation is bringing something tangible into your life through attraction and belief, i.e. if you think it, it will come. 

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

All it takes is starting the day looking through a positive lens to change your entire perspective. Have you tried it before? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I encourage you to write down in the comments the kind of affirmations you're going to start telling yourself this week‚Ä¶ Here are some that I personally love:

- I am good enough.
- I make others happy!
- My body is healthy and capable and strong! üí™üèº
- How good my day is is up to me!
- I'm loved
- I don't HAVE to workout, nourish my body or get my work done today‚Ä¶ I GET to do those things, and that's a blessing!

How about you? ü•∞ I'd love to hear them & I'm sure they'll give someone else inspiration too!

More than  million results for ‚Äúhow to get rid of stretch marks‚Äù

. million results for ‚Äúhow to get rid of cellulite‚Äù

. million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of hip dips‚Äù

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. To feel ashamed of them. But these features are human.

Most of the time, the internet (social media especially) makes people feel worse, rather than better üòÖ

It can negatively impact body image & sleep, increase bullying & FOMO, and lead to greater feelings of anxiety, depression & loneliness.

But that doesn't have to be your experience.

The messages we consume on a daily basis really do matter‚Ä¶ and if the messages we're consuming are full of unrealistic expectations, highlight reels of people's lives, posed/edited photos, sunshine & rainbows, then we'll start to wonder why our lives don't look the same. And all of a sudden, our life/body/career/relationships aren't good enough. 

Don't get me wrong, the internet is an incredible tool, it's something I personally LOVE & sometimes what we see of others online is inspiring & can propel our mindset in a positive direction‚Ä¶ But other times, it's self-sabotage‚Ä¶ It makes us compare ourselves, feel incomplete & behind in life.

I think we underestimate how important it is to set healthy boundaries & be mindful of the content we're consuming every day.

Protect your peace. Fill your online world with content that makes you feel GOOD. Content that makes you feel seen. People who inspire you & empower you. 

And remember that social media isn't always reality, it isn't always the full picture (well, it NEVER is) so please don't be so hard on yourself. You're exactly where you're supposed to be at this point in time üåª

 luna: *scratching at dresser* let in 
 me: no luna i cannot have it if you wake up to potty and cant make it down three flights of drawers in time 
 luna: *scratching intensifies* let 
 me: no im not opening it for you 
 luna: *breaks in anyways, squeezes entire body thru crack in frame* 
 me: fine i guess i cant stop you 
 
 
 
 
 i dont understand why this one just cant poop and sleep where i'd like her to. but i cant argue with her because i'll take persistent disorient over her having an insulin attack any day. even if shes scratching profusely at am. just gotta let her live her best life while she still has it. ive tried everything to make the set up of my room as ferret friendly for her as possible but she insists on being difficult and sleeping in my sock drawer
