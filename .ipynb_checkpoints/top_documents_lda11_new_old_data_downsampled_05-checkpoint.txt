Doc ID: 4194, distribution: 0.9859676847355531 ; Therapy was going well this morning. I was glancing at the clock and thought I was doing ok for time. In fact, I thought how we'd talked about a lot and were still only halfway through. Then we moved topics and T was speaking when I suddenly remembered that because we had had to reschedule the session to a different day, we had actually started  minutes earlier than usual.  I exclaimed this to T, cutting her off mid-sentence. She paused and then empathised.   “Ahhh yes, that happens to me too sometimes when someone comes at a different time to usual….. Has it thrown you a bit?” “Yesss…. because I thought I had  minutes left…. and now I've only got  😭😭” Thankfully, T very graciously extended the session a bit, because as she said “Well, we did have a couple of computer issues right at the start of the session that took up a bit of time” Honestly, she gave me more minutes back than the computer issues took up. I'm grateful she doesn't hold really rigid boundaries (although she does keep the ending time firm enough usually).

Doc ID: 9550, distribution: 0.8935706281927768 ; you don't need to justify your weight gain to anyone (including yourself), and the only thing weight gain really means is that you've gained weight. that's it.

weight gain doesn't mean you need to change how you eat.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less beautiful.

weight gain doesn't mean you've “lost yourself”.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less healthy.

weight gain doesn't mean you can't still rock your favorite outfit.

weight gain doesn't mean you should be less confident.

weight gain doesn't mean you're any less worthy.

weight gain doesn't mean ANYTHING about the wonderful human you are.

weight gain really doesn't have any inherent meaning, and it's important to remember that our bodies are MEANT to change throughout the course of our lives. even if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, your actions, how you feel, and your quality of life matter a whole lot more than your weight does.

recently, i've gained weight, and you know what? i'm cool with that. i know it can feel a lot easier to know and be told than to truly believe, but you deserve to love yourself and accept yourself no matter how your body changes.

your body is the vessel to your soul. it WILL change, but your worth never will.

brown rice and lentil pilaf with caramelized onions:
i made this on a whim but here's what went down! i sautéed an onion in olive oil until caramelized and placed to the side. then i added some pre-steamed brown rice and pre-cooked lentils to a pot with enough vegetable stock to cover. i brought this to a boil and then reduced heat to low and covered, stirring occasionally until the liquid was all absorbed! at the end i drizzled in some balsamic vinegar, more sea salt, and threw the onions on top! .

Doc ID: 8148, distribution: 0.9926411708133539 ; yesterday on my commute home i came across a podcast about “weighing what you want”. i didn't even listen to be honest. but the phrase caught my eye. i consider myself fairly immersed in the fields of health/wellness and body positivity, but never once have i heard this string of words. never once has “weight” been up to us, something that we align with what we “want”. i instantly thought positively of this phrase. it was freeing to me, to think that if i want to be happy, i'll weigh the weight that will grant me this opportunity. but i acknowledge that so many people out there probably read “weighing what you want” negatively, because what they want is fed to them by society. it makes me sad to think that there are men and women out there with a desire to look and weigh a way that they're taught to believe is beautiful even if it's unrealistic, unhealthy, and unattainable for them. i support weighing what you want, as long as you want to be happy and healthy. every person who struggles with an eating disorder is different. as obsessive as i was, i never weighed myself. so being forced onto a scale for twice daily weight checks while inpatient traumatized me; i hated that scale and how much control it had over whether i would leave the hospital or not. since then, i've sworn off of it. i don't see a need to attach a number to who i am, the life i lead, or what i'm capable of. we place too much weight on weight, when it's not nearly as influential as we allow it to be. weigh what you want.

Doc ID: 8188, distribution: 0.9890967858217485 ; yesterday on my stories i posted a step by step tutorial for this super easy loaded veg salad i've been making for lunch lately. i got quite a few requests for lunch/dinner options so i figured is share my favorite as of late. the best part about this is that it can be varied to match your preferences and whatever you have on hand! i always start with a base of greens and toss it in avocado oil and sea salt. you can toss in garlic and nutritional yeast for extra flavor! then i throw in whatever roasted vegetables i have on hand (carrots, brussel sprouts, zucchini chips, red pepper slices, and asparagus are a few ideas). i always have cherry tomatoes on hand so i add those too. then add a grain or starch (roasted sweet potatoes, quinoa, or lentils are my go-to options). for protein, add your favorite option! for me it's normally salmon or hard boiled eggs. always add avocado (life tip). lastly i add pumpkin seeds or raw walnuts/cashews for a crunch! toss it all together and throw in more avocado oil as dressing. sometimes i even take a few spoons of hummus and water it down and toss it in as dressing. i know that was a lot and it sounds complicated but it's super simple! never gets boring if you consistently change it up. hope this helps some of you! ❤️

But I'm officially out of the binge food I bought, I cleaned and rearranged my room and pantry, and I feel renewed. I can't undo anything, but I can keep going forward. This is a process. I also just started a new book, Empty by Susan Burton, a memoir describing the author's own struggles with bingeing and starving. I don't know if it's helpful to keep focusing on food and recovery stories, or if I should be trying to redirect my attention to literally anything else to “rewire my brain”, but regardless it's an interesting read. It's truly incredible how universal some of disordered eating experiences are. It's comforting in a morbid way, to know you're not alone.

 As the High Holidays approach, it can be hard for those of us who are hard on ourselves. But I heard something really beautiful today: 
“Teshuvah is the conscious decision to have compassion upon yourself.”

It seems like you're picking and choosing what you want to focus on "changing.". 🤔 Answer: Come back to me when you've spent hrs housebound with two babies, and then tell me that the chance to go run in the fresh air for - minutes on your own isn't the most amazing feeling and goes a long way to helping you stay sane. The exercise is not going anywhere. It's a healthy thing for me. My exercise levels have been very steady for a long while, and increased levels of running round the house can't replace a run outside or a swim. I just need to fuel that exercise properly, and that's what's been hard the last couple of weeks.

Doc ID: 9876, distribution: 0.9895247386224036 ; life hack for living a happier life: stop caring so much about what other people think or do!!
——
*disclaimer: some opinions are helpful when they're from people you trust to tell you if you're going crazy, to push you if you need encouragement, and to keep you in check*
——
i know it's easier said than done to stop thinking about what you think you *should* be doing and start prioritizing what you want to be doing, so here are some practical things to remember:
✨you will never be everyone's cup of tea, so stop trying. being your own is what matters most.
✨when people have negative comments or even judgments to make, it's usually a reflection of them and not actually about you.  from what i've learned, the people who are negative about someone else who didn't do anything directly to them are usually struggling with or are insecure about something themselves.
✨what's the worst case scenario? that someone *may* say something about you? is that really bad enough to hold you back from living a life that fulfills you and makes you happier?
✨you only live once. i don't mean to be morbid, but we're all going to die eventually. in , , or  years from now, i hope you get to look back on your life without regrets and knowing that you chose to be true to yourself and happy.
——
and lastly, if you catch yourself judging or making comments about others, please stop. let's all try to focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves and lift other people up for doing the same, even if it's a different way than us

Doc ID: 8812, distribution: 0.9892146454294001 ; The biggest fear holding most people back from living their truest lives is people JUDGING them…⁠
⁠
While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.
⁠
Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ⇣⁠
✨ the  year old version of you ⁠
✨ the  year old version of you
✨ people who are curious about the things you are but don't have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
✨ people who your message will inspire and change
⁠
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

you deserve to live a really truly happy life, and to do that, you have to learn to let go because where energy goes, energy flows. letting go of anything can be really hard because how things already are may feel safe, and with most loss, there's a sense of grief that comes with it. but, i promise you that the things and people that only add negativity to your life are not worth holding onto, and there is so much life beyond what you're used to that will open up to you when you make the space for it.

in order to keep moving forward, we need to let go of the energy that is no longer meant for us and free ourselves from the chains that are holding us back. your life won't be empty, your life will be open, open to receiving more opportunities, building healthier relationships, creating positivity, receiving calm energy, and becoming fuller than it ever was before.

you deserve that.

Doc ID: 9537, distribution: 0.9880338925652612 ; it's hard to feel good about yourself when somebody is mean to you all the time. don't forget that you are somebody too. 

you know how someone can tell you that you're smart, amazing, and beautiful  times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn't really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you're incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't share about my hard days too. i've mentioned that i've been struggling a bit lately, and if i'm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.

if you need to hear it: you don't need to be your “best self” to be worthy and lovable. you are, have always been, and will always be enough.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

Please make sure you keep yourself healthy above all, but if you're eating slightly more than usual don't blame yourself for it! It's normal and circumstances are very stressful right now. Not having a routine can be very difficult for people with executive dysfunction as well, and if you've lost all track of time and can't manage to do anything at all anymore that's okay! Take your time to recollect and make a plan and new routine for yourself to follow. Start small, and make sure it's reasonable so you can stick with itI love you all, times are scary and uncertain right now. Take care of yourselves 
Thank you! Its been tough, im overeating constantly and have been in sweatpants the entire time to hide myself. But, im almost . Gaining weight is one of the most natural things to happen at my age. A grown woman gotta look like a grown woman. Its still hard to accept but i know everything is temporary and the only one who cares is me. When life gets back to normal things will settle down for me and my eating will level out i think. Just gotta forgive and move on, no point in stressing over it all. Stay safe yall. Stay home. Wash your hands and disinfect your living space daily: your phone, remotes, controllers, makeup brushes, faucet handles, door knobs, fridge and microwave etc!

Doc ID: 2623, distribution: 0.986002737420332 ; Happy Real Me Monday! 🤩 The reason I post these every Monday is because I KNOW that at some point in our lives we've all thought to ourselves, “I'll start on Monday” — which usually refers to a health kick or fitness journey BUT what if we used it for our self acceptance journeys too? Start practising positive self-talk & accepting yourself TODAY... RIGHT NOW, start messy, start while you're bloated and your hair is an oily mess! 👀

This caption is about to get kinda dark & philosophical, but stay with me here... I want to try something.

Imagine you're on your deathbed. You're  years old (💪🏼), you look down at your hands, they're wrinkly and frail, you're unable to move your body like you used to, you need physical support from your loved ones just to do the normal everyday things you've always done (make food, shower, clean & poop). Now ask yourself this:
-Do I regret eating that burger with my friends?
-Do I regret never going to the beach because I was ashamed of the dimples on my legs?
-What do I wish I started doing sooner?
-What things did I take for granted that I wish I could've appreciated more at the time?

I can almost guarantee you wouldn't regret eating that burger, but you WOULD regret avoiding the beach & letting your insecurities restrict you from living your life the way you want to. Maybe you wished you started making healthier choices, or appreciated your young & healthy body, or joined the gym or had the confidence to ask that person out on a date, no matter what it is that you wished you did or started sooner, I have some GOOD NEWS... You're not on your deathbed. You're capable of doing anything you put your mind to! You're in the perfect position to start LIVING and stop hiding. And if you're not happy with your current lifestyle or mindset around your body image, YOU are the only person in control of making those positive changes for yourself. 

You're a wonderful person with a wonderful heart who deserves to live a fulfilling, happy life that isn't controlled by the distorted view you have towards yourself. I just hope this will inspire you to see that 💛

I think my journey has got far too long to really be of interest to read from the start though! I'd quite like T to write a book about my therapy though, I'd be curious to read it from her point of view. I think there'd be a big chunk in the middle that was pretty boring though. “Faith turns up week after week and we argue about food. We seem to go backwards and forwards over the same issues. I tell her it's like we are on the top of a rollercoaster, not enough forward momentum to gather and travel down the hill but just enough to prevent us rolling backwards. Faith thinks this is not the case, she says that things are changing. She doesn't let me close enough yet for me to understand what is going on for her inside. She still keeps herself quite a closed book so I believe there is more happening than I can see from here.” Haha I think that's therapy years - in a nutshell

Doc ID: 3021, distribution: 0.9806474369685954 ; Today has been a Good Day. Such a relief after a couple of weeks of feeling mostly blah. I think it's because my cold seems to have gone and I've been busy today. My Get Up and Go seems to have come back! I had another foster carer come round for coffee first thing. She's a very new foster carer and I'm mentoring her, so we had a chat about all things fostering and that was lovely. It's great to share things you feel passionate about. Then baby and I hustled out to our baby sensory class, which the baby loves. When we got home, she went down for a nap and I went out for a run. H working from home has some benefits! I ran k along my favourite route and it felt so good to feel up to running again. Two weeks of feeling rubbish with a cold and a cough has meant I haven't done any running for a while. Came home and baby had woken up from her nap, so I've been entertaining her and trying to send a few emails this afternoon, as well as chatting with d - it is lovely to have her around again. It's been great to feel I have enough energy to bustle around doing these things and just feel better in myself. On the downside I haven't really eaten any meals so far today, due to the hustling around. That's not good. I've made a macaroni cheese and broccoli bake for tea so I will definitely eat some of that. Eating hasn't been so good over the last two weeks due to my loss of appetite through being ill and also the low mood I've had. I need to get myself back on track before it spirals into anything worse. Maybe I'll mention it to my therapist tomorrow, although I don't want to get into a big discussion about it (too much else to talk about). I'll just tell her it's not been great but I'm going to make an effort to make it better this week.

It's a Bank Holiday so everyone has the day off work (in theory). Boxing Day sales are a thing, some people go mad for shopping and get to the shops at am to queue and wait for them to open. But for most people it's just a day to relax after Christmas, eat leftovers, see relatives, play with Christmas presents and probably drink alcohol at inappropriate times of day. Many people go for a walk on Boxing Day (we ventured out despite the rain).In general it's more like an extension of Christmas Day than Black Friday.

Doc ID: 3816, distribution: 0.9711136725839794 ; Question: Are you managing to keep using therapy to work on the same things you were pre-pandemic? All I can think about is the virus and lockdown and how much it's impacting my mental health and I'm so mad about having to spend so much therapy time on it every single week but I can't think about or concentrate on anything else  Answer: No not really. Pre-pandemic we were deep into some work about my attachment style and my relationship with H. Then the pandemic came and completely threw me off for a few sessions. I had a full session when we tried to talk about H and I, and I couldn't focus at all and we just kept coming back to the virus. The week after that I asked T if we could just do a half session because I knew mentally I wasn't in a place to do therapy work, and it was mostly a check in. The week after that we did another half session, but we did get a bit deeper into stuff and it felt like we could have carried on for the full session. Then last week we did a full session again and we did do therapy but we didn't talk about the stuff we had been in the middle of pre-pandemic. That stuff felt a bit irrelevant in current cirucmstances. Instead we talked about some new stuff that came out of talking about my eating and intake.I'd say just go with what's on your mind, if that's the pandemic, then allow yourself to talk about that and process everything that's coming up. Maybe once you've let yourself do that you'll find that your mind starts to feel more open to discussing other things again.

Doc ID: 4627, distribution: 0.9548069749894281 ; Question: Heya! I'm wondering if you had any ideas for this problem I've been having. I've been going to my therapist for about  months now and I really like her but I really really struggle to open up. I make a list before hand and I promise myself I'm going to talk about self harm stuff, or the maternal transference or something equally embarrassing, but when I get there I clam up and we end up talking about what's happened in my week. (/) Answer: Go easy on yourself with the pressure to open up. It's hard to force it when you're not ready and haven't built up enough trust in the relationship yet. It will naturally become easier, but in the meantime could you try writing a list as you are doing but then handing it to your therapist at the start of the session? I used to email my therapist a list of headings before my session. Now I usually write my list and have it next to me and I tell her “I've got  things on my list this week” so she can manage the session to help us get through them all. Sometimes I don't know where to start, and then she asks me if I want to start with the easiest or the hardest, and we have a bit of a meta-conversation “talking about talking”. Doing that can make it easier to finally get going on a topic, talking about which ones the hardest, why it's hard, what might make it easier etc Even maybe just go into your session and say what you've written here. That you've got a list but you keep just ending up talking about the last week instead and it's frustrating you. Hope that helps a bit!
