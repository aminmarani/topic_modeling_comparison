this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä® 
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :)

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - saut√©ed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

toss brussel sprout halves in olive oil and sea salt. in a separate dish toss honeynut squash chunks and apple chunks in olive oil, sea salt, and maple syrup. add all three onto a lined baking sheet with parchment paper. mix together to spread everything out. toss on pecan pieces and bake for  minutes on , flipping halfway through. once that's done set aside and prepare the maple tahini kale. ‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è

massage raw kale in a drizzle of olive oil/lemon/sea salt. after a minute dollop a few spoons of the dressing on and massage through for a minute. personally i served this dish cold, so i had the veggies in the fridge for awhile to get chilled and then tossed them with the salad to serve! .

What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer. And think youre winning in life That is a VERY frightening place to be in and even harder place to crawl out of. A very sad, tiny little world to be in. Triggers in recovery are normal as fuck. I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of iti remember scrolling down the ed recovery tag back in december, when my relapse was getting worse by the day, but i could still say at least i wasnt depressed, i hadnt lost my will to live, then, though i knew it was only a matter of time - a couple of weeks at most. this post hit close to home back then. this fucked up sense of achievement was always transient and it felt ever more unsubstantial the deeper i fell into my ed, but i could never let the memory of it go. soon enough everything felt so much more hellish and miserable, and i was dragging everyone down that dark, hopeless road to nowhere with me because anorexia had completely taken over my life. eventually i wished i would die because i didnt know how else i could make it all stop.ive been in recovery again for the past week. i couldnt exactly remember what was written in this post but i felt the need to look for it again a few days ago, and ive found it worded one of the biggest reasons why ive committed to recovery and why its been worth all the hardships in a very piercing way.thank you for this. i know ill keep coming back to this post. 
I adore you and will be here for you in your recovery journey.

Doc ID: 7260, distribution: 0.9973506066388932 ; when it comes to eating disorders, here's some stuff i feel like we're all kind of quiet about:

- the co-morbid diagnoses. i struggled with anorexia, but this diagnosis didn't perform in a vacuum. my toxic relationship with food and my body triggered a host of other issues: major depression, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and OCD. i refused to get out of bed unless i had to. i failed to maintain relationships. i couldn't leave a room without silently repeating a string of numbers. i couldn't take a bite until i waited an exact amount of time between each one. my headspace was riddled with irrational fears and my ability to function was compromised. 
- the conflict. i spent every waking second torn between two opposing thoughts, regardless of the topic. the sick part of my mind wanted to starve; the healthy part wanted to eat. the sick part wanted to lie to my parents; the healthy part wanted to break down and hug them and never let go. the sick part believed this was surrendering; the healthy part knew this was healing. 
- the paranoia. i believed every person was out to get me. i never let anyone handle my food because i thought they would try to ‚Äúruin my progress‚Äù. i never ate in the presence of others because i thought they were judging me for my choices. 

disordered relationships with food and our bodies are made up of layers of side effects. these other issues are hard to talk about. but when we bring them to the light and expose them to air, we see we're not alone. we can find healing in comfort, in community. 

it's painful for me to talk about these past hardships but it was more painful to suffer silently. i stayed quiet for years because i was embarrassed by these afflictions. i truly believed they were my fault, and reflective of who i was as a person. my worth. my character. i now know this not to be the case, and i hope my sharing these words can help others realize the same. 

when something is hard to talk about, that means we have to talk about it. there is so much strength to be found in vulnerability. so here i am, trying. taking steps to opening difficult conversations. we don't suffer alone, no matter how isolated we feel.

So why bother. Literally. Why bother with the constant suffering if it changes nothing about how you feel. Eat. Eating fuels your brain. It fuels your cells to do their cellular job. If youre trying to survive on nothing you will feel like trash emotionally and physically. Why are you so fucking depressed??? Cuz your brain cant take the bullshit. Any brain surviving on XXX will % be a very upset brain. You cant Happy yourself out of that. You dont have the energy to do that. Fucking eat. The biggest hurdle but the most important step to recovery, is letting go of a sick body. You NEED to gain, you need to let go of controlling your body. A healthy body is nourished. A healthy brain doesnt obsess over sizes and numbers. Its not that simple yes it is. Eat. Force your Ed to shut the fuck up. Cry if you need. Scream if you need. But just fucking eat. Your emotional well being, physical wellbeing, and mental health will all improve as you begin actually feeding your brain and body. Duh. Fucking duh. I absolutely see where you're coming from, and being where you're supposed to be physically works wonders on your mind - but in order to really let go of a sick body, you'll need more than just nutritional restoration. I knew I had to eat enough to keep my body alive for years, but the lack of resources for my mindset just invalidated the hell out of me and kept me sicker. You can't recover without taking care of the physical aspect first, but that can only go so far without needing mental help to cope with all of that.If I'm taking your post too literally, I apologize.
I definitely think getting therapy cannot be ignored in recovery. Absolutely people need mental help to get better. Its the physical part a lot of people tend to slack on. Just therapy isnt enough. You cant heal unless you work on both your brain and your body.

- my hunger levels are definitely lower, and i've now been eating ~- calories a day. i have fluctuations, but the consistent weight gain seems to have stopped, which means i'm reaching or around my set point
- MOST days are good or neutral body image days, and i think i've gotten pretty good at having ~body neutrality~. i still have bad body image days sometimes, but i've realized that bad body image is usually a response to other stuff in my life going on and isn't really a response to how my body actually looks even when it feels like it, so i'm able to dismiss the negative thoughts pretty quickly
- i have been averaging one structured workout a week for pretty much this entire weight gain journey so far because of other things. this has probably been the hardest on me mentally because it took me years to build the amount muscle and strength i had. i'm proud of how far i've come with my relationship with exercise though and know that it's okay for body comp to change in different stages of life
- i didn't realize until this morning how big of a win it was for me that i haven't had a binge eating episode (if you didn't know, i struggled with binge eating disorder for  years), since i started this all in journey
‚Äî‚Äî
i share where i'm at right now, not so you can compare your journey to mine, but so that if you're on a similar journey as i am or have been, you can maybe feel less alone or have hope. this is my second weight gain journey since choosing recovery and isn't a response to healing disordered eating (i've been fully recovered for ~ months now), so this process has looked wayyy different than when i gained weight immediately post-restriction.  i say this because i know some of you are gaining weight, and i don't want you to misinterpret that committing to eating in excess and weight gain while healing from disordered eating is easy because it isn't. it was the hardest thing i've probably ever done. but, it is WORTH IT, you CAN do it, and eventually you WILL get to a place where food doesn't consume your mind, numbers don't affect how you view yourself, and you are TOTALLY free

Doc ID: 8001, distribution: 0.9971884866307951 ; refeeding. in the eating disorder space, it's rarely touched on yet common in most recoveries. but what is it?
.
every recovery is different. personally, my recovery was from a restrictive battle with food. i had lost nearly half my body weight, and this time called for restoring weight. a lot of it.
.
when i finally began to eat again, i was afraid that the self-control i had cultivated over  four years would be ‚Äúruined‚Äù. that i wouldn't be able to compose myself when faced with a full plate. for too long, eating was an all or nothing task, and now that it couldn't be nothing, it had to be all.
.
i've been asked if i experienced ‚Äúbinge eating‚Äù in recovery, and here's where refeeding comes in. when the body is deprived of food for a long time and then food is reintroduced, it gets‚Ä¶excited. my body wanted to make up for all of those starving days and grumbling nights. .
for years i had tinkered with my body's natural messages. part of my recovery was relearning hunger cues. after awhile, they had disappeared, and now that i was calling them back home, they had to readjust. and they weren't exactly accurate. .
this isn't unhealthy. there is a learning period that comes with recovery, and feeling hungry even after a dense meal is not WRONG. your body learning its hunger cues is like you learning to do a math problem. both take practice and there will be errors along the way. but eventually, things begin to click.
.
when i was refeeding, i would eat large meals and feel hunger ten minutes later. i would grow frustrated with myself, angry for not being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, scared that i was eating ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. i remember trying to rationalize with my body. ‚Äúyou can't possibly be hungry you JUST ate‚Äù.
.
what would i do? i would eat more, because my body was asking for it. the entire time i was miserable, confused, to be so full and yet so hungry. but i ate, because i had to show up for my body, had to allow it to fall before it could stand.
.
all of that just to say that recovery is a learning process. there is no correct way to recover. your body was subject to trauma, and now it needs to find its way back home. it's during times of discomfort that we grow the most üí´

some examples:

‚Äúi can't trust my body because whenever i eat X, i gain weight.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äúi've broken trust with my body by trying to control it, and weight gain is not inherently bad. my body is on my side, and if it changes size by nourishing it with what it's asking for, then it was supposed to change size.‚Äù

‚Äúmoving my body every day is healthy.‚Äù ‚Äî> ‚Äútaking care of my body every day is healthy. sometimes that means movement, and sometimes that means rest.‚Äù

‚Äúbeing smaller than other people makes

Doc ID: 7299, distribution: 0.9971407702163874 ; my recovery from my eating disorder was a time in my life marked by loss, release, and acceptance.

i personally struggled with restrictive eating and overexercising. every eating disorder looks different, and not all include these elements. this is my story. it's one tale of thousands.

when i committed to my truest recovery, i had to gain a significant amount of weight to restore my body's health and functioning. i swore i could accomplish this while also holding onto all of the toxic behaviors that got me to this point. i was in denial. i insisted i could have it all.

i wanted to gain weight and recover and still eat diet-esque ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods. i wanted to gain weight and recover and still work out every single day. i pleaded with my parents and treatment team. i justified my choices. looking back, i can't believe i kept a straight face as i begged them to let me work out ‚Äúbecause i just love it so much‚Äù.

you know when i finally recovered? when i healed my relationship with food and exercise. and you know when i did THAT? when i finally let go of my need for control, surrendered my obsessions, and accepted my reality. when i finally shut up and followed my meal plan. when i finally shut up and complied with a  month total exercise restriction.

this comes from a place of love, but that love is tough love. if you loved ‚Äúeating healthy‚Äù and ‚Äúworking out‚Äù for the ACTUAL RIGHT REASONS, you'd be willing to give up your control around them if it meant finding true health and happiness. the right reasons to love these things are simple: you love to eat well and move because these acts contribute to a sense of peace and serenity within. if you're using either of these to hurt yourself, how can you love them for the right reasons? you simply can't. it's time to be real and face all the irrational lies.

there's no healing without loss, release, and acceptance. all discomfort is temporary. it simply can't be avoided. please stop fighting yourself...it's just üëè not üëè worth it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 7339, distribution: 0.9971407702163874 ; i like to think that we have some control over what happens to us.

i'm a firm believer in ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason‚Äù. i find comfort in knowing i can't control most things. while i may not be able to control EVERYTHING that happens to me, i can learn from what i go through.

when i finished inpatient treatment for my eating disorder, i had to return to normal life after months living in a hospital under constant supervision. i had to return to being a normal  year old high schooler. adjusting was hard. i felt fragile.

the hardest thing about this time was learning to cope with what i couldn't control. in the hospital our conversations were monitored; no talk of calories or weight was permitted. we weren't allowed to wear tight clothing, didn't own full body mirrors. it was a whole different world, built to protect. everything was controlled to keep us safe from ourselves.

the real world doesn't work this way. things happen to us, and they could be triggering. i learned over time what my triggers are, these things that i can't control. and i learned how to react to them. i learned from what i went through. i still learn from what i go through.

the world is a scary place. it's not always working in our favor. i went back to school, with fresh weight gain and emotional wounds. i was surrounded by high school girls who talked about weight, who skipped lunch, who obsessed over being small. i felt helpless. i was hurting from being in this setting, but what power did i have?

i learned to stand up for my needs. i removed myself from conversations. i distanced myself from toxic relationships. i fell into friend groups with more meaningful interests. if i was uncomfortable, i called my mom, my best friend. i meditated. i couldn't control everything around me but i learned how to cope. 
we are undoubtedly in unstable times. things are happening to us that we can't control. we may feel triggered or weak. remember to feel these things. acknowledge them. and then ask yourself what you can do to work through them. you have control over how you react, and therefore what happens to you next. make the right choice...even if it's hard ‚ô•Ô∏è

Doc ID: 9750, distribution: 0.9969693164684852 ; contrary to popular belief, i strongly believe that binge eating disorder is also a disorder of restriction.

based on my personal experience, other people's testimonies, and the research literature analysis that i've done, frequent binge eating is very often a result of restriction, and it's essentially your body's survival tactic. if your body thinks that it's starving or going to starve, and there's food available everywhere around you it's going to instinctively want to eat everything (think: at the beginning of quarantine when everyone excessively stocked up in fear). it's not a lack of willpower, but rather, your body trying to help you. when guilt followed by restriction (even if it's mental restriction) occurs after a binge, this can cause a repeated cycle to occur. breaking out of this cycle isn't a matter of willpower around food, but rather a matter of breaking the restriction that leads to the binge eating.

i think there's a lot of stigma around binge eating-  according to @neda, binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder, yet in the recovery community on this platform, it seems to be the least talked about.  all disordered eating struggles are valid, and if you are struggling with binge eating, let me tell you that binge eating in and of itself is NOT a bad thing, so you don't deserve to let the fear, guilt, and anxiety of binge eating consume parts of your life.

give yourself permission to let go and move forward after a binge, be the supportive and empathetic friend to yourself that you have the power to be, and if you binge again, it doesn't mean you've failed, so keep going. the goal isn't to never over eat again, to even never binge eat again, or to control the way you eat at all because the more distant i get from my ED, the more i realize that the goal has never been about what or how i eat. the goal is to not let your eating control you, so that you can live your life to its fullest.

no-bake triple layer pb pretzel brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- / cup mini gluten free pretzels, chopped into piece
- / cup creamy salted peanut butter
-  tbsp vanilla protein powder of choice OR  tbsp oat flour‚Ä®‚Ä® 
add the crushed pretzels and peanut butter to a bowl and mix until well coated. stir through the protein powder or oat flour to thicken up the mixture and spread onto the base layer.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

-  tbsp maple syrup 
- - medium soft dates, pitted
- splash of vanilla
- sea salt
- cinnamon

chocolate layer:‚Ä®
-  chocolate bar of choice, chopped
-  tbsp peanut butter 

directions:

add all of the crust ingredients in a blender and blender until uniform. transger to a brownie pan (i used a small tupperware) and form into a solid layer. place in the fridge to set for five minutes. while that's setting, make the date caramel layer by adding all of those ingredients to the blender (rinsed after making the crust) and blend until smooth/uniform. you may need to add more water in  tbsp increments to get the blender moving, especially if it's not a super high power one! transfer the caramel onto the crust layer and place back in the fridge to set for a few minutes. melt the chocolate and peanut butter (i use the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between). once smooth, pour over the caramel, spread evenly, and place in the fridge for set for at least  hours. remove, let thaw for a few minutes, slice, and store in the fridge!

FOUR ingredients‚Ä¶ you're kidding. 

i promise you'll save this so fast hahaha. you must make ASAP. details below!

-ingredient chocolate stuffed brownie cups

brownie base:

- - medium soft pitted dates, soaked in boiling water for a half hour to soften (optional, but ideal)
- / cup cacao powder
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter‚Ä®‚Ä®
add these three ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until a dough ball forms. you should be able to roll the dough out in your hands without it breaking. if it's too loose you may need to add a tbsp or two of water to thicken.

split the dough into balls and form a cup shape, making sure the center is deep and the edges are high. place these on a parchment paper lined plate and place in the freezer to set (about  min)

while the brownie cups are setting, make the chocolate filling:

- - medium soft pitted dates
-  cup chocolate chips/chopped chocolate of choice
-  tbsp hot water‚Ä®‚Ä®
blend in the blender until smooth and silky. i left mine on the thicker side, transferred to a bowl, and whisk in another  tbsp of water (slowly) to smooth it out and make it a bit runnier. place the chocolate filling in the fridge to thicken up a bite while the brownie cups are still setting.

remove the cups from the freezer, dollop chocolate filling into each, and place back in the freezer to set. when you're ready to eat, let them slightly thaw for a few minutes or microwave for  seconds (so good this way). this recipe made  cups for me!

also‚Ä¶at the end of the day i think we can all agree that the superior flavor combo will always be peanut butter and chocolate. right?

-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (üòâ), let's talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg ü§© It's not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip üèù
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our ¬£ a night hotel room . . . ¬£ you guys!!! üò± It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)üëåüèª
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay üëèüèª
-
üáπüá≠ Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you üôà They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
üáπüá≠ Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point üòÜ . . .
-
üáπüá≠ The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up üòÇ It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it üôåüèª
-
üáπüá≠ Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great üòÖ
-
üáπüá≠ I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing ü§® There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country üòç Please please visit üíö‚ú®

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok üòè).
-
The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes üëèüèª please üëèüèª
-
We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push ü§® ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.
-
Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! üòÖYou cannot win with British people I'm afraid. And Holly is % British, that's a fact.

-
These shorts honestly give me life and I cannot wait to put them back on again. All I need is a bit of a glow to go with them, but even without, I'm sure I'll be beaming. Speaking of tans, I do actually STILL have an awful tan line on my legs. I wore shorts pretty much every day on the other side of the globe, so it's not that surprising really, although I'm just amazed at how I've managed to keep hold of it üòÖ Congratulations Holly. You're legs still look like drumstick lollipops.

Ok, so whilst that may be an achievement to celebrate, I'm even more proud of running my longest distance ever yesterday! It was pretty tough, mentally more than physically actually, but the feeling afterwards was so incredible. I surpassed the distance I was aiming for; did some parkour to escape from a field I go lost in; and trekked up some pretty tough hills, despite trying to avoid them üôà

Now for the Holly waffle of the day . . .
-
This week has so far reminded me that laughter truly is the. best. medicine. Honestly, I laughed until I cried on the evening of my dude's birthday when we did our little family non-pub pub quiz. Without a doubt, the highlight of my lockdown so far. Cats are apparently really 'lucky' when they fall, Elton John's first hit single was 'Baby' and the Great Fire of London was in  (if you've seen the vlog, you know) üòÇ
-
I also laughed this entire morning editing the Q&A Em and I filmed, also on her birthday. Coming @  today (farts and laughter all included) üòâ

So here's my reminded to all of you guys reading to have a laugh and almost wet yourself. On the daily. I am generally a very uptight person, and often find it hard to let loose shall we say. But wow, we're high not only on green smoothies right now, but a lot of serotonin and endorphins too. And it feels good üòèüôà

Now as someone who hasn't read many books at all (shock horror, yes I know and I'm sorry üò≥), I'm very clueless with all this stuff. A title and author doesn't really mean that much to me.

Doc ID: 2595, distribution: 0.9960204156341586 ; Now THIS is what I wish I saw in the media growing up‚Ä¶ üì∞

If I saw other women with realistic, relatable, healthy & normal features in magazines growing up, it would've caused my confidence to: üìà instead of: üìâ

Instead, we see the photoshopped versions of the people we look up to, and when we do see someone with similar features to us, it's plastered all over the front page with derogatory headlines (swipe across to see what I mean üòì)

 in  women struggle with their body image‚Ä¶ Are you one of them? If you are, leave a ‚Äúüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äù in the comments & if you're not, leave a ‚Äúü•∞‚Äù.

We're quite literally brought up to believe the body we're born in needs to be fixed & scared into new short-term, unsustainable diet fads each week instead of being inspired to be our healthiest & happiest selves long-term.

Now, I know I can't possibly represent everyone because we all have different body types & live different lifestyles, but I guarantee that if we were educated on how normal (& common) these features are & saw diverse bodies of all sizes, shapes, colours, disabilities, etc being represented & accepted, I think the amount of women & men who struggle with their body image would be so much lower. 

Can you just imagine how the -year-old version of yourself would've felt if Britney Spears was on the front cover, cellulite & all, EXCEPT with a positive, uplifting headline about how happy she looks, rather than tearing down the PERFECTLY NORMAL cellulite on her legs? (Swipe across to see the cover I'm talking about üëâüèª)

The more we see it, the more we normalise it‚Ä¶ So while the reality may not be embraced in magazines, you can still choose what you consume online. So curate your feed carefully! Opt in for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse üåü

Would love to hear your thoughts üí≠

Doc ID: 2635, distribution: 0.9895888266500216 ; Possibly the most realistic weight loss post you'll ever see & read. And that's because this isn't just a ‚Äúweight loss transformation‚Äù. Let me tell you why...

In this post I'm not going to put my very worst photos beside my very best because I wanna get REAL. 

In the photos on the left, I was kgs heavier, I had a really bad relationship with food and my body image. I was disgusted by my body & all of the things I initially considered ‚Äúflaws‚Äù: my cellulite, my rolls, my bloated tummy, everything. I couldn't bear to see my own reflection. 

But just in case you have the impression that weight loss is going to magically fix all the things you're insecure about, I wanted to show you from my own experience that even though you think losing weight is going to make you happy or erase all of your insecurities... It probably won't. Even now, after I've lost kgs, I still get bloated, I still have cellulite, I still have rolls when I sit, dips in my hips and a lower belly bump. But the difference NOW is that I understand the definition of flaw (‚Äúa mark or other imperfection which weakens a substance or object‚Äù) does not apply to any part of my body ‚Äî does cellulite, bloating & a lower belly bump WEAKEN me??? Absolutely heckin' NOT. See, self-acceptance happens on the INSIDE!

What I've realised along the way is that this was a HEALTH & HAPPINESS transformation... Not a weight loss transformation. I live a healthy lifestyle because I love my body, not because I hate it. So no matter what journey you're on right now, remember all the amazing things your body is doing for you, not just the way it looks. Be kind to your body, fuel it well, live a healthy balanced lifestyle, exercise because you can ‚Äî not because you have to, and my gosh, just enjoy your life... üíõ

It's in the tv shows we watch, the magazines we read, the social media accounts we follow & the voices we are surrounded by growing up.

It's NOT YOUR FAULT if this messaging has taught you to not feel good enough, but IT IS up to you to be more aware of the messages you consume. You CAN unlearn the messages you've unintentionally consumed all your life to end that cycle for yourself (& your children/loved ones too) so that you can be happy in your skin.

Every voice matters.

Just imagine how different we'd feel if we grew up around positive reinforcement & a realistic, sustainable approach to health, food & fitness ‚Äî instead of constantly hearing the examples in this video which:
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π set unrealistic expectations
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π makes us believe the most important thing we have to offer is our body
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π weight loss / thinness equals happiness or success
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π makes us believe smaller is better 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π our value can be found on the scale
‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π we are ‚Äúless than‚Äù if we aren't ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù

All of that can go in the üóë

The messages we consume become us. So let's pursue positive change, for ourselves & the generations to come.

This is why I share what I share‚Ä¶ I hope I can be just ONE voice in your world that reminds you that YOU ARE ENOUGH as you are üåª

This is one of the most frequent questions I receive... and while my weight loss did reduce the appearance of my cellulite, it didn't make it disappear completely! As you can see in this photo ‚§¥Ô∏è

I wanted to show y'all that no matter how much weight you lose, there will always be 'imperfections' or parts of your body you may not love (at first). That's why the best fix for those things is confidence... Learning to accept your body with all of its lumps, bumps, rolls, stretch marks and scars is SO IMPORTANT!

Cellulite is simply just how your body stores fat cells underneath your skin, sometimes it's smooth, sometimes it's dimply. It's a very common, HARMLESS skin condition that affects % of women & % of men. There's no magic cream, machine, diet or pill that will change your genetic makeup. This is the way my body accumulates fat... Is that something I can change? Nope. Is that something I WANT to change? NOPE! ü•∞

I know I'm not the only one out there with cellulite, leave a 'üçëüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è' comment below if you've got these cute leg dimples too! ‚≠êÔ∏è

You could be told everyday how beautiful you are by those around you, but you'll never see, believe or feel it unless you start viewing yourself for everything else that you are‚Ä¶ because all the things that make you beautiful aren't found in the way that you look. You aren't your best or worst photo. You aren't your body or looks.

You are the warmth people feel when they see you laugh or smile, you are the kindness you show others, you are beautiful because of your story, your challenges, your strength, your ability to make others feel safe/seen/heard, the way that you light up when you're doing what you love, the confidence you have when you wear the clothes that make you feel good, the way you inspire others by owning your ‚Äúflaws‚Äù & just being yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it when it's the least important thing about you. If you could be outside of your own eyes for a day, I think you'd see how much more you have to offer yourself & the world than the way your flesh sack looks. Please don't give it more power than all the light you have to shine ‚ú®

(I post this weekly series to share what would've helped me when I was struggling with my body image, food & online comparison. I share these for my younger self, who felt a need to edit my photos to look a certain way online. There is nothing wrong with the left OR the right. Both are human, both are me, minutes apart. While I can't represent all bodies, I CAN showcase my reality & be part of the change I wish to see in the world. I hope to encourage you to be a lil kinder to yourself & live a life uncontrolled by the way that you look)üå∑

This is why I post these ‚ÄúInstagram VS reality‚Äù type of posts, because it's one of my most impactful ways to show how curated social media is, why we shouldn't compare ourselves to others & how our bodies can look different ALL THE TIME!

These photos were taken on the same day, minutes apart. On the left, I'm standing tensed & posed or with lighting that softens the dimples on my body making me look like I'd walk around with a toned body every moment of the day‚Ä¶ But then, less than  mins later, when I relax, you can see that my body looks almost entirely different.¬†

But now I understand that Ô∏è‚É£ everyone I see online, in the media or even in person might not be how they or their lives look at all times Ô∏è‚É£ I understand that we are all built differently, with different lifestyles & habits, so we cannot compare ourselves to anyone Ô∏è‚É£ I can now appreciate ALL bodies & especially my body for what it does for me, instead of the way it looks, and Ô∏è‚É£ finally, I understand now that having fat on my body, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks, loose skin, belly fat (etc) is so normal, part of being human, not in need of ‚Äúfixing‚Äù, shouldn't discourage me from continuing to do my healthy habits & overall it's part of my happy, sustainable, healthy balance.

More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of hip dips‚Äù
The list goes on. [ad]

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. Do you have to LOVE them? No of course not, but these features are human.

Let's approach them one by one‚Ä¶

Belly fat: a layer of fat is vital for a healthy, functioning, fertile body. It's essential that the human body has some, you would not function without it. It serves to absorb vitamins, store energy, protect & insulate your body. 

Loose skin: is due to your skin stretching at some point‚Ä¶ It will likely tighten up again slowly over time depending on how much you have. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's something to be in awe of!

Stretch marks: AKA a beautiful purple/pink scar that shows you how much you've grown. Almost everyone will have stretch marks at least once in their lives as we all go through a growth spurt from child to adult.

Cellulite: more women have cellulite because the structure of our connective tissue is different to men, which causes our skin to dimple where theirs doesn't (as much).

Hip dips: the appearance of hip dips is due to your BONE structure & the shape of your pelvis. If all of us could see our skeletons, we would see an indentation where the hip bone meets the top of the thigh.

(Even those who appear to not have any of them, most likely do!!)

Here's a proud video of mine, along with showing you how easy it can be to ‚Äúhide‚Äù these things online which is why we don't see them very often, but I promise you are definitely not the only one with them üåü

The more we see it, the more we normalise it ü•∞
