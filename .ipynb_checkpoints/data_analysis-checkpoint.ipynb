For example, the wedding description neglected to describe the bride, but instead focused on the venue and the food. The short description of the child categorized the child solely in terms of food preference. I used this as the main theme because getting more specific caused the themes to be more granular and \"diverge.\"\n",

      "When rating the theme, I focused on the engagement level and emotional response it might evoke from the audience. Considering the theme's emphasis on body positivity and self-love, I anticipated that it would likely generate significant engagement, as these topics often resonate deeply with individuals. Additionally, I assessed how well the theme might inspire viewers to take positive actions or reflect on their own perceptions of beauty and self-acceptance. Overall, I aimed to gauge the potential impact of the theme on fostering a supportive and empowering community around body positivity.\n",
