-
So I haven't tried a vegg (sorry were rolling with it here) since going vegan and removing all animal products from my diet, and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't miss the taste of meat/dairy/eggs at all, and it was kind of strange eating something so similar to food I don't eat anymore, but I did actually enjoy it. The best part was cutting it open (if you saw the video, you'll have seen it üòâ) and it definitely had the texture of an egg. I also tried these vegan popcorn chicken bite things made out of jackfruit: pretty cool too. I think the creativity that goes behind the making of all these substitute foods honestly mind blowing.

this recipe is wild hahaha. the first layer is a rich, fudgy, cookie dough-like brownie bite. the middle is a decadent and perfectly sweet and salty mix of caramel pecan pie. and the third, in signature healthful fashion, is a hearty coating of thick chocolate. there's really nothing you won't love about these. did i mention the recipe comes together in under  minutes and there's no baking required? 

say less‚Ä¶

double fudge no-bake caramel pecan pie brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- - soft pitted dates
-  tbsp creamy tahini
- / cup raw pecans, finely chopped‚Ä®

add the dates and tahini to a food process or blender and blend until a thick, sticky paste forms. this took about  minutes for me. at this point stir through the pecans until fully coated. transfer this layer to the base layer and spread evenly.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

*  scoops of chocolate protein powder of choice

chocolate topping: melt / cup chocolate chips with  tbsp coconut oil in the microwave for  seconds. give it a good stir, then pour over bars. place back in the freezer to set.‚Ä®

if you watch my stories you'll know i share some version of this crispy quinoa and feta veggie bowl literally every single night without fail. it's my go-to dinner!! think low effort with high satisfaction. i change it up based on what veggies i have on hand but the gist is always the same.

i love creating intricate recipes but honestly by favorite meals have no recipes at all‚Ä¶ like this one. just throw it all in the pan and trust that it'll be delicious. 

that being said, since there's no true recipe for this dish i'll leave some basic details below. i hope you try this out in some way! it's such an incredibly satisfying and flavorful dish :)

details:

- i start by saut√©ing the veggies i'm using on the stovetop. this night i used zucchini and broccoli (which i steamed first, as this is my favorite way to cook broccoli specifically). i added kale too!
- for the quinoa, i use microwavable packs! i'm huge on saving time in the kitchen when i can, and i honestly love tricks like this. there's nothing wrong or unhealthy about simple shortcuts :)
- the tofu i had prepped already! but i typically slice, toss in olive oil and spices, then bake for  min at F. then i broil for  min at F to get it extra crispy!
- the sauce i'm using the coat everything here is a whipped hummus and feta dip (i made this earlier in the day for another recipe i'm sharing soon, but basically it's hummus and feta blended together with some other spices‚Äî i'll share full details in another post)
- once you add the quinoa and feta (last step), you'll want to cook everything on high for about - min. this let's the quinoa get crispy in the melted cheese (a dream)!!!!
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

#ad #NakanoRiceVinegars 

whipped sweet potatoes with crispy chickpeas

serves 

sweet potatoes:
 medium sweet potatoes, peeled
 tbsp. non-dairy butter
 tbsp. full fat coconut milk
 tbsp. @nakanoflavors Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
a pinch of sea salt

crispy chickpeas:
 -oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
 tbsp. NAKANO Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
 tbsp. olive oil
a pinch of sea salt

start by preparing the sweet potatoes, puncture the sweet potatoes using a knife, then transfer to a microwave-safe dish filled with an inch of water. place the sweet potatoes in the bowl, cover with a paper towel, and microwave for  minutes (flipping halfway through). while the sweet potatoes are steaming, prepare the chickpeas. drizzle the chickpeas with the rice vinegar, oil and sea salt and mix until thoroughly combined. transfer to your air fryer basket and cook at ÀöF for  minutes. while those are cooking, remove the potatoes from the microwave and mash with a fork. pour the butter, milk, vinegar, and salt over them and begin to whip using a hand mixer. this will take - minutes until the mixture is uniform and fluffy. transfer to a plating dish. remove the chickpeas from the air fryer and top the potatoes with them. feel free to add an extra pat of butter and a drizzle of the rice vinegar to finish.

Doc ID: 1400, distribution: 0.998582003137659 ; Changing environment. Changing mindset. Changing support system. I also lived in a similar environment but it was my mother who decided to be extra loud about calories right after I told her I was diagnosed with bulimia. She also had weight loss surgery and would show off how little she would eat and talk about how she would throw up all the time. It was the most infuriating and painful thing. It sent my ed spiraling and I struggled for years because of it and because if her negligence. Sometimes the people who should care the most will end up caring the least. And there isnt much that can convince them to give a crap. I wish I could give you some tips but if they dont shut the fuck up about it around you, you wont get better. And until they actually LISTEN to you and your needs, you will continue to struggle. Idk how old you are or your financial standing, but if you are able to find a different living situation, that would be pretty sweet and totally beneficial. If not, just avoiding them can help. I would have movie marathons alone in my room to avoid my triggering family. Id also eat by myself too. Getting rid of opportunities for triggers is cool. Stop spending time with them. Doesnt do you any good.I know its super common for literally everyone with an ed to think we arent actually sick enough. Dude the fact that you even took the time to ask me about it proves you are suck enough. Someone who isnt sick wouldnt be in treatment, wouldnt be with a dietitian or therapist or in outpatient or be needing more treatment options. Someone who wasnt sick enough wouldnt be in all of those things you are in right now. Someone who wasnt sick enough would not be triggered over diet talk from people around them. You ARE sick enough. You need to tell yourself you are sick enough over and over until you believe it yourself. Even when people around you dont seem to believe it, what matters is if YOU believe it. What they think is irrelevant. Your recovery is about you, not them. Put your time into other people. Whether its friends IRL or even people online. Put your time into people who actually support you, and stop putting your time into the people who continue to trigger you. I have a hard time with keeping my cool too especially with confrontation. Writing it out in a letter could be helpful. Getting your thoughts out in a nonconfrontational way, and giving it to your shitty family so they can read it and not feel threatened, and then can respond in their own way. You could even request they only respond to your letter by writing their own letter. Takes out the emotional conversation part. Try it out. Also There isnt going to be any instant fix. The reality is, not everyone is able to make the changes that will benefit them best. Especially changing environment. Packing up and moving to someplace new isnt really an option for a lot of people. Its fucking shitty but sometimes you just gotta power through. Gotta deal with it until you dont have to anymore. If you cant move now, you certainly will in the future. And you gotta keep fighting the good fight until you get there. You know? It DOES get better. Its happened to me, it will happen for you. It really does get better. Keep fighting until you get there, trust me. Please take care

What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer. And think youre winning in life That is a VERY frightening place to be in and even harder place to crawl out of. A very sad, tiny little world to be in. Triggers in recovery are normal as fuck. I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of iti remember scrolling down the ed recovery tag back in december, when my relapse was getting worse by the day, but i could still say at least i wasnt depressed, i hadnt lost my will to live, then, though i knew it was only a matter of time - a couple of weeks at most. this post hit close to home back then. this fucked up sense of achievement was always transient and it felt ever more unsubstantial the deeper i fell into my ed, but i could never let the memory of it go. soon enough everything felt so much more hellish and miserable, and i was dragging everyone down that dark, hopeless road to nowhere with me because anorexia had completely taken over my life. eventually i wished i would die because i didnt know how else i could make it all stop.ive been in recovery again for the past week. i couldnt exactly remember what was written in this post but i felt the need to look for it again a few days ago, and ive found it worded one of the biggest reasons why ive committed to recovery and why its been worth all the hardships in a very piercing way.thank you for this. i know ill keep coming back to this post. 
I adore you and will be here for you in your recovery journey.

Doc ID: 7573, distribution: 0.997875244661494 ; growing up i had an eating disorder. it lived as a voice in my head. it convinced me of wild, disgustingly unhealthy beliefs. it created rules i couldn't break. it sheltered me, hid me from the world, shrunk me until i lost myself in thin air.
.
.
healing came through exposure. by testing feared waters. by simply doing the damn thing and seeing firsthand that the world wouldn't come crashing down. go up in flames.
.
.
how everything would be...fine. .
.
i was deathly afraid of most foods. of eating before a certain amount of hours passed between meals. of eating without working out that day. of not working out twice a day. the fears i held prevented me from leading a normal life. i was incapable of going with the flow or listening to my body. living in the real world threatened my disorder, so i chose not to.
.
.
but i was seventeen when i began recovering. i had an entire life ahead of me and college around the corner. i couldn't cling to these ways and expect to live a fulfilled life. .
.
i had to rebel against every last rule.
.
.
i ate the foods my disorder swore would ruin my life. i ate between meals when my stomach grumbled, not when the clock struck the perfect hour. i ate regardless of physical activity done for the day. i stopped doubling up on workouts. then i stopped working out altogether, for some time. .
.
exposure therapy is the only way to heal. how else do you expect to realize that the things you fear are irrational? you need to experience it directly. you need to walk into the fire you crafted in your head and walk out unburned, unscathed, just to realize that there simply isn't a fire at all. .
.
today, i engage in behaviors that used to be toxic fears. i now eat foods that once terrified me without thinking twice. i now work out to feel good and grow stronger, not to burn every morsel that enters my body. liberation washes over me as i nourish myself with the things that once brought me the greatest pain. .
.
this is healing. this is trying. this is what happens when you stop feeling sorry for yourself and pick yourself off, dust yourself off, and really kick this thing to the ground.
.
.
just try your best. your best will get better.

Doc ID: 7905, distribution: 0.99786403827448 ; at  years old, i had to relearn nearly everything i knew about being human.
.
my eating disorder had turned me into a zombie, a machine. it drained me like a parasite. it stripped me of every last touch of life. i was empty, always empty. .
so when i finally began a true recovery, i had to leave this behind.
.
i had to relearn the simple things. how to walk across a room without growing lightheaded. how to climb stairs without taking a break to sit after each ascent upward. how to sit in a chair without my tailbone screaming with agony.
.
i had to relearn the things that human beings naturally seek out for their well-being. how to eat without a demon in my ear insisting i would self-combust for doing so. how to stay put when an anxiety attack whirled inside my stomach. why? because my sisters got to go for runs and my teammates got to go to practice and me? i wasn't allowed to exercise for months.
.
i had to relearn the things that take you from existing to living. how to laugh again. how to accept an invitation for a meal out, one i couldn't control, in order to mend broken relationships. how to follow my heart instead of my hyper-structured schedule. how to say yes, yes, yes to everything my eating disorder would have never allowed.
.
i had to relearn how to be selfless. how to heal myself so those who loved me could sleep at night. how to accept my body for how it looked and what it could do because it deserved better than a voice in my head. how to skip the gym, have a second lunch, embrace schedule changes in order to accommodate others in my life.
.
and i'm still learning. i'm learning how to love, how to receive love. how to accept. accept the life i've been given, the body i have, the way i look. how to be kind, how to stay stronger than the fleeting whispers of a disordered behavior from lifetimes ago. how to keep going when it feels crippling to do so.
.
recovery from an eating disorder is a lifelong pursuit, an intimate and emotional endeavor to find peace in your own heart. it is hard, it is taxing‚Ä¶but it is stabilizing, it is rewarding. it is the most humbling challenge i will ever take on, and for that i'm deeply grateful. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8030, distribution: 0.9977699441706224 ; i always thought that once i recovered from my eating disorder, my life would be perfect.
.
maybe that's because in comparison to living with my disorder, anything in its absence was better. life after recovery meant freedom from the ills that plagued me on a daily basis. life would be perfect.
.
i've been ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù for years. i don't believe in absolute recovery from an ED. i know this is a controversial topic, but ill always stand by the notion that recovery is a lifelong commitment. life after recovery means that what was once a blaring siren of a voice is now a faint whisper that surfaces with less and less frequency.
.
you learn to hear that whisper and understand that it's an old behavior creeping up, an ancient thought, a past fear. it's small enough and you're strong enough to recognize its presence and then show it the door.
.
that's what life after recovery is. it's learning to live beyond the confines of what used to hold you captive.
.
what it's not, is perfect.
.
i was convinced that i would recover and my life would do a . that once i was past my behaviors, had restored my mental imbalances and physical body back to health...that then i'd be just like everyone else. my friends and family i used to watch from a distance, living their best lives in good health.
.
what i failed to realize then was that  after recovery i was still subject to being human.
.
i mess up, a lot. i hurt people and i regret it. i lose my temper, i let fear stop me from exploring new things. i say no when i should say yes, and sometimes i agree too quickly. the hardships of life after recovery are just hardships of life, and that was a fact that failed to sink in for a long time.
.
nobody leads a perfect life. when it comes to recovery, we hold high expectations for ourselves. we want it to be ‚Äúworth it‚Äù, and fear settling for a life that's less than perfect.
.
all i know is that being rational is the hardest endeavor while suffering from an ED. the entire illness is characterized by irrationality. but being mindful of your humanity, understanding that life will be hard here and there, that a bad day isn't a bad life...that is the best you can do.

Doc ID: 7485, distribution: 0.9977451108873502 ; i tend not to write in the moments i need to the most. when i'm overcome with fear whose origin i can't trace. when i'm washed over with anxiety with no end in sight. i tend to write later, when these emotions have passed and i'm back on solid ground. stabilized.
.
.
but this is something i'm working on. writing in the moment. .
.
like right now on christmas morning. the holidays are hard. i think they always will be. one moment i'm fine, great even. and the next i can't explain why there's a whirlwind in my chest. or why everything feels heavy. how is it possible to surrounded by so much love, so much life, to be in a crowded room and feel so far away for brief flashes at a time? flash and you're gone. flash and you're back. in and out. up and down. .
.
today i had to retreat to my room for a few minutes before taking a long, hot bath. an hour to myself. an hour to sit with my thoughts. an hour to breathe deeply and remind myself that this time of year is complicated. that it's okay to hurt and not know why. .
.
i come from a family incredibly rich in love, in support, in forgiveness and in warmth. my holidays are abundant with all of these qualities and for that i am deeply grateful. i've grown tremendously in the years since i was sick, in the years since i tormented myself and my family and cast a dark shadow over all of us. i've found good health on all fronts. i've found light and happiness and life.
.
.
but that doesn't mean things are easy. moments of distress are brief in passing but carry a weight i can't ignore. writing helps. self-care helps. being present helps. i know it's easier for me to talk about how amazing my season is going, how much joy i've found along the way. and while this is true, it's harder for me to talk about the little moments, about the pain and the ‚Äújust because‚Äù tears and the brain fog and the fear of what feels like nothing at all. it's harder for me to do this, so i feel like i have to.
.
.
if the holidays are hard for you, i see you. i'm sorry. these moments of discomfort that challenge us, that force us to check in with ourselves‚Ä¶while they hurt, they are for the best.

Doc ID: 7299, distribution: 0.9977068063342881 ; my recovery from my eating disorder was a time in my life marked by loss, release, and acceptance.

i personally struggled with restrictive eating and overexercising. every eating disorder looks different, and not all include these elements. this is my story. it's one tale of thousands.

when i committed to my truest recovery, i had to gain a significant amount of weight to restore my body's health and functioning. i swore i could accomplish this while also holding onto all of the toxic behaviors that got me to this point. i was in denial. i insisted i could have it all.

i wanted to gain weight and recover and still eat diet-esque ‚Äúsafe‚Äù foods. i wanted to gain weight and recover and still work out every single day. i pleaded with my parents and treatment team. i justified my choices. looking back, i can't believe i kept a straight face as i begged them to let me work out ‚Äúbecause i just love it so much‚Äù.

you know when i finally recovered? when i healed my relationship with food and exercise. and you know when i did THAT? when i finally let go of my need for control, surrendered my obsessions, and accepted my reality. when i finally shut up and followed my meal plan. when i finally shut up and complied with a  month total exercise restriction.

this comes from a place of love, but that love is tough love. if you loved ‚Äúeating healthy‚Äù and ‚Äúworking out‚Äù for the ACTUAL RIGHT REASONS, you'd be willing to give up your control around them if it meant finding true health and happiness. the right reasons to love these things are simple: you love to eat well and move because these acts contribute to a sense of peace and serenity within. if you're using either of these to hurt yourself, how can you love them for the right reasons? you simply can't. it's time to be real and face all the irrational lies.

there's no healing without loss, release, and acceptance. all discomfort is temporary. it simply can't be avoided. please stop fighting yourself...it's just üëè not üëè worth it.

Doc ID: 9603, distribution: 0.9975836650735213 ; reminders to stop comparing yourself to others and caring so much about what others think!

YOU WILL NEVER BE FOR EVERYONE- some people like their coffee black, some like it with cream, some like it iced, some like it hot, and some people don't like it at all. you might not be for everyone, but you can  always work on accepting yourself.

YOU DON'T SEE THE FULL PICTURE- you don't know what internal struggles other people are going through. you don't see what people are or aren't doing outside of the moments you see. on social media and in real life, you never see the full reality of other people's lives, but you see all of your own.

WISH OTHER PEOPLE THE BEST- you might not see what other people are dealing with behind the scenes, but you can still wish them happiness. if someone is celebrating an accomplishment, you can wish them happiness without beating yourself up for not accomplishing the same. if someone is showing their healthy lifestyle changes, you can wish them health and happiness without feeling like you need to make the same changes they are. ‚Äúyou can admire someone else's garden while still watering and admiring your own‚Äù.

PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND HOW YOU FEEL- do you find yourself comparing and feeling pressured when you're on social media? set boundaries with it and take breaks. do certain accounts make you feel worse about yourself? protect yourself, and mute, unfollow, or block accounts that aren't serving you (you can always undo this). do certain people make you feel appreciated and comfortable being your authentic self? spend more time with them.

BUILD YOURSELF UP SO YOU DON'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU- other people's opinions of you, positive or negative, are none of your business. be kind to yourself, spend time with yourself, learn to accept yourself, and treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend because at the end of the day, you're what you've got, so YOUR opinion of you matters way more than other's.

there's other people's expectations and society's standards, but we get to make the rules for our own lives! i say we live it!!!

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup ü•∞

So often people joke about ‚Äúgirls on Instagram VS girls in real life‚Äù or catfishing in general‚Ä¶ These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look ‚Äúflattering‚Äù & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat üôÑ

The thing is, you don't have to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù all the time‚Ä¶ ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life‚Ä¶ Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone ‚Äúperfect‚Äù & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own‚Ä¶ Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

In  BC, women were considered beautiful for having ‚Äúfertile‚Äù fuller bodies & for what their bodies could do‚Ä¶ In , women are losing their periods due to the pressure they feel to eat less & be smaller. 

It scares me to think that I could have an entire social media page full of photos like the ones on the left & use it to sell the idea of that particular body i.e. workout/meal plans, unrealistic body expectations, or endorse products that promise a certain outcome‚Ä¶ When truthfully, a healthy & active lifestyle = the body on the right for me & it might look like something COMPLETELY different on anyone else.

Nobody really tells you that even when you're working out & eating balanced meals, you'll still have cellulite, get bloated, have belly fat & belly rolls, stretch marks, loose skin, and all the things that still wobble & squish. Nobody tells you that those things don't need to be fixed because they're all very normal human features (which they are!!) ü´∂

For this reason  years ago, these ‚ÄúReal Me Monday‚Äù posts were born & my life started to change forever because I realised that body/beauty trends aren't realistic, that confidence & true happiness comes from within & showing up as you are‚Ä¶ instead of punishing your body, hiding yourself & changing the external parts of you. 

How do beauty trends make you feel about yourself? Leave a ‚Äúüåπ‚Äù if it doesn't impact you in any way & a ‚Äúü•Ä‚Äù if it leaves you feeling less than/worse about yourself.

In , I hope that beauty can be more inclusive & positive & focus on within, as it should. It starts with us rejecting all the unattainable trends & the narratives that are fed to us by the media & all those who benefit ($) from making us feel bad in our skin‚Ä¶ We've got this! ‚úä

Now, I know I can't possibly represent everyone because we all have different body types & live different lifestyles, but I guarantee that if we were educated on how normal (& common) these features are & saw diverse bodies of all sizes, shapes, colours, disabilities, etc being represented & accepted, I think the amount of women & men who struggle with their body image would be so much lower. 

Can you just imagine how the -year-old version of yourself would've felt if Britney Spears was on the front cover, cellulite & all, EXCEPT with a positive, uplifting headline about how happy she looks, rather than tearing down the PERFECTLY NORMAL cellulite on her legs? (Swipe across to see the cover I'm talking about üëâüèª)

The more we see it, the more we normalise it‚Ä¶ So while the reality may not be embraced in magazines, you can still choose what you consume online. So curate your feed carefully! Opt in for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse üåü

Living a life full of things that makes you happy > being miserable on your endeavour to look a certain way.

I'm not saying your body isn't important. Your body is this incredible vehicle that keeps you alive & deserves appreciation, but not for how it looks‚Ä¶ for what it DOES!

So often we risk our mental health for our physical appearance.

There's this universal belief that in order to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù or look a certain way, you need to sacrifice the things you love. But realistically, by drastically changing your life & cutting out things that bring you joy, won't that just make you feel miserable & restricted in return?

I promise you, your physical body & mental health can BOTH thrive at the same time, it's not just one or the other. You can live a healthy lifestyle without sacrificing things. You CAN eat the food that provides high quality energy for your body & also the food that simply tastes good. You can workout in ways you enjoy, it's not a one-size-fits-all! You can rest! You can embrace your body with all of those beautiful lil things society deems ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù! You can enjoy yo' life!

Please, don't let your body shape or appearance become a higher priority than your happiness. 

Don't be so hard on yourself for not looking a certain way‚Ä¶ Your appearance is the least interesting thing about you üôèüèº

You can do whatever you want to with your body, if you wanna change it, okay then go for it üòä, if you wanna learn to accept it as it is, AMAZING‚Ä¶ I'm not here to tell you one is right & one is wrong, I'm just here to remind you that you can be both HAPPY & HEALTHY at the same time. Approaching your health & happiness in a balanced way is EVERYTHING. 

Go create those healthy, balanced, flexible habits that ADD to your life, not detract from it üéâ 

In your current frame of mind, what's more important to you? The way you feel (ü•∞) or the way you look (ü™û)? Let me know with the emoji below üíõ

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure‚Ä¶ 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their ‚Äúbest‚Äù
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying ‚ÄúYou are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were‚Äù so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today ü¶ã

Happy Real Me Monday! üíê

Ever since I lost kgs I get asked every day, ‚ÄúHow much do you weigh? I'm making this my goal weight!‚Äù ‚öñÔ∏è and I can understand the desire to know because I used to wonder the same. I'd see a photo of someone just like Kendall, I'd research her body weight & I'd tell myself ‚ÄúOk, when I get to that weight, I'll look like her & I'll be happier!!‚Äù but it doesn't work that way. (Also, PSA: there are MANY claims that Kendall's body is photoshopped on the left ‚Äî so please understand that the left photo is an unrealistic body goal anyway!)

Kendall & I both weigh the same... But our body shape is completely different because the number on the scale only indicates how heavy you are, not your body composition, which is the amount of muscle VS fat you have on your body. Your body composition makes a huge difference in what you look like even though it can't be measured by the scale. On top of that:
- our genetics are different
- our lifestyles are different
- our diet is different
- our routines are different
- our height is different
So why would our bodies look the same?

Just because you don't look like her, doesn't mean you're not as beautiful. Beauty isn't a one-size-fits-all. It shines from the heart ‚ú®

Weight is just weight. It does not define YOUR VALUE or what your body will look like! It doesn't tell you how healthy you are or how strong you are or how loved you are. So I encourage you to stop worrying about the number on the scale & instead focus on HOW YOU FEEL, bettering your health, improving your relationship with food and your body image! I'll be here every step of the way üíõ

If you've ever felt insecure & negative towards these parts of your body, leave a 'üíõ' in the comments. Let's show other women (and men) they're not alone in feeling this way, but I hope videos & reminders like these will slowly chip away at the negative self-talk & encourage you to accept or eventually even embrace yourself like I have.

Confidence isn't a one-size-fits-all, be kind to yourself & to one another, because we've all been programmed to never feel good enough & to always want to be more 'this' or less 'that' ü•∫

Our thoughts become our reality. If I continued picking myself apart & thinking there was something wrong with my cellulite / my thighs touching / my tummy bloating, my mind would constantly cherry pick all the things I don't like about my body and I'd NEVER be happy or comfortable in my skin. But once I started seeing more REAL bodies online, being kinder to myself & accepting my body as it is without all of the posing, sucking in & editing, I started feeling more confident overall. Feed your mind and body kinder, more forgiving thoughts & watch your life change. 

YOU are wonderful & you are enough, okay? GOOD, ILY ü•∞

Jumping on this trend because I resonated so much with it & thought maybe y'all would too‚Ä¶

Body image is a person's thoughts, feelings & perception of the aesthetics or attractiveness of their body. It's not *actually* about your body, it's about the way you speak to & think of yourself. 

At my lowest weight I still wasn't happy‚Ä¶ Look at that face ü•∫ I was so focused on looking as lean as possible at all costs that I'd completely overlooked what that state of leanness had actually cost me‚Ä¶ I'd forgotten how important LIVING MY LIFE was. I had bad body image days more often than good ones because I was always striving to be ‚Äúmore this‚Äù and ‚Äúless that‚Äù. 

Those extra few kilos I've gained in the photo on the right is the freedom to snack out on sleepovers with my besties, to order what I want from the menu, to not weigh and track everything I eat, to not push myself to extremes in a workout, to enjoy my life to the fullest! It's the freedom to accept my body changing & see myself as a whole person, instead of one body part or flaw.

üö® Disclaimer: this isn't supposed to be a comparison of my body type but rather my mindset now compared to then. It's just that the left photo was taken at a time when I was hard on myself & couldn't find peace with my body. My body image is much better now, not because of my body, but because I'm nourishing my mind with more forgiving, accepting, positive thoughts üå±üö®

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

üåü Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
üåü Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
üåü LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world ü•π I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same‚Ä¶ Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
üåü Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
üåü Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you‚Ä¶ 
üåü If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key ü•∞
üåü At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us üíÖ It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible ü´∂

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks üíó
