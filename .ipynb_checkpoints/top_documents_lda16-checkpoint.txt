vanilla matcha cake üçµüç∞

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

Here for you!! Recovery is hard especially on your own. It took me a few tries over the course of a couple years to get my momentum.

This mini rant is not directed to you personally, i promise. youre cool as hell. )man everybody really needs to stop assigning rankings and levels to eating disorders and recovery. theres no leveling system for how bad an ed is or successful recovery is. theres no percentage. thats all made up to make you feel like shit. theres no such thing as % sick or % sick or % sick. either you are sick or you are not. either you are struggling or you are not. The fact that you even entered recovery in the first place PROVES you were sick. Who the fuck cares ‚Äú‚Äúwhat percentage‚Äù‚Äú of sick you were. that shit isnt real. Your ed just wants you to feel like ass and pretend it was never ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù so you'll come back to it. its all a manipulation tactic. its bullshit. ‚ÄúSorry you have % cancer, not enough for any kind of treatment, we are gonna wait until you waste away to % cancer to do anything about it‚Äù ??????????? thats not how this works. and on the topic of quasi recovery.. i see that shit everywhere. and so many people slip into it when they get the idea that they werent % sick to begin with.. so they cling to the ed, because maybe THIS TIME they WILL be % sick enough.. but they disguise it as recovery to make everyone else happy. Its not a good place to be. Never build your mental health on lies. Its REALLY great that you noticed this and are aware of it. REALLY great. Because you now have the choice to take the next step toward real recovery and the next step AWAY from ed. % recovery is just living without an eating disorder. and that shit takes WORK. hard work. I want you to know youre feelings about it are normal. it happens waayy too often i promise you, youre not a loser or faking anything. Normies dont question themselves like this. Normies dont even consider questioning themselves like this. All sickness needs healing no matter what degree of pain someone is in.

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä® 
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

start by cooking your pasta according to the package. the one i used said to boil for  minutes, but i found  minutes to be perfect. this is a chickpea pasta by the way, which makes this dish high protein! once the noddles are done cooking, drain and rinse with cold water. add to a bowl and add the following:

- diced red onion
- diced green onion
- cucumber slices
- avocado chunks
- chopped parsley

toss everything together and then add in the vegan lemon pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

But then if one of them tests positive for COVID, the bubble is said to have burst and they all have to self isolate at home.

Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.

all jokes aside, once i found out the distinction of reacting from fear vs LOVE, i realized i've been reacting out of fear on autopilot for a VERY long time. 

being patient with my reactive self has been just as much a part of my journey as learning all the ‚Äúhigher self‚Äù stuff. 

we deserve the love, grace, and patience that we grant others as well. 

i let my clients know that we probably won't get to levitating and being breatharian conscious after our  months together‚Ä¶ but they will definitely know the difference between choosing from love vs fear. 

and we practice that. we also practice NOT sef deprecating because you are doing your best and your soul deserves to hear that. 

if any of this is what you're working on - let's chat!

i help women gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, lead with love instead of fear, and build confidence with their inner voices. 

üì≤send me a DM ‚Äúi'm ready!!‚Äù to chat about where to go next 

OR you can apply to my coaching program through the üîó in my bi‚ù§Ô∏è @amandavsevilla 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8712, distribution: 0.9844891946310165 ; hint: you don't actually need to HAVE all the things or truly be confident and clear on your forward motion for this to work!

Next time you sit down to ‚Äúmanifest,‚Äù consider this:

‚ú®what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

‚ú®what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

‚ú®what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

‚ú®what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

‚û°Ô∏èThose FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

‚ùå‚Äùthat's not actually true for me right now‚Äù
‚ùå‚Äùi'm not in abundance right now‚Äù
‚ùå‚ÄùI can't do that‚Äù

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like‚Ä¶ which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

I help women gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.

Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ‚á£‚Å†
‚ú® the  year old version of you ‚Å†

When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9925278499716464 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 15372, distribution: 0.9914365514940392 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ what do you talk about in supervision?‚Äù This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - ‚Äúthat can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times‚Äù.  ‚ÄúMmm‚Äù I fidget a bit. ‚ÄúThere sounds like there's an ‚Äúand‚Äù in there‚Ä¶.‚Äù T comments. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.‚Äù T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. ‚ÄúAvoidant attachment‚Ä¶. yes, yes I see that in you‚Ä¶‚Äù. She carries on reading. ‚ÄúHmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents‚Ä¶. How did it feel to read that?‚Äù I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof‚Ä¶ not that I think you were making it up‚Ä¶. but that you weren't just being nice‚Ä¶ like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said ‚Äúok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!‚Äù. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

Doc ID: 15367, distribution: 0.9808661356239711 ; Therapy .. // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or‚Ä¶, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. ‚ÄúMaybe there's not a Perfect cake‚Äù said T, ‚ÄúMaybe there's just a Good Enough cake.‚Äù That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I'm in a 'which cake' dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don't want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I'm away (benefits of online therapy y'all).

Sometimes she gets like this, she says lots of really good and potentially helpful stuff but sometimes she gets carried away and misses the fact that I'm not quite with her. I was still processing something she'd said just previously which I was quite impacted by, and there she was going on and on about something that felt quite irrelevant. Eventually I burst out in frustration ‚ÄúCan you stop talking for a minute!‚Äù T stopped talking immediately and said ‚Äúmm of course‚Äù. Then she said ‚ÄúWell done for telling me to stop‚Ä¶. I'm glad you could say that to me‚Ä¶..‚Äù (Sorry T sorry that was rude, thankyou for taking it so well) I was so shocked that I'd just cut her off like that. T probably thinks of it as progress. I sat in stunned silence for some minutes after, trying to get control of myself and cope with what I'd just said and also think about she'd said immediately before all of that, that had rather knocked my feet from under me.

Can't decide which anxiety is worse to sit with. Internal monologue: Make the phone call! Ugh but no. Will probably be ok. No need for phone call. Probably just worrying over nothing and it will all be fine anyway. Ah but could put a stop to worrying about it by just phoning to check. Oh but phone call. Ok rehearse what would say.  Actually will probably be unnecessary. I'll just sound stupid because it was all ok anyway. Won't bother. Oh but what if the thing turns out to not be booked. Then I'll wish I had just phoned‚Ä¶

T answered me straight away with a very firm ‚Äúno‚Äù. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Doc ID: 16144, distribution: 0.9747841264630647 ; Question: I was wondering if you do think I am really lucky with T that we have just been a great fit for each other and the way she does therapy really worked for me. It took me a long long time to build up trust with her (now I see that was transference and I was just very scared of her responding to me the way important people have in the past) but she must have learnt a lot about me through that period. I think it really depends how your therapist works, but one useful tip I learnt in therapy is if I get stuck, to talk about the process. So I say, ‚ÄúI have a list of things here but they're too hard to start talking about‚Äù. Or ‚ÄúI have thoughts in my head but I can't put them into words‚Äù etc. Then T knows what I'm thinking (remembering she's not a mind-reader!) and she can help me move forward.I'm happy for you to private message me but apologies in advance if I don't always reply very speedily üòä

Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.9733141334284839 ; Talking about (shhhü§´) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about‚Ä¶ that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said ‚Äúoh I was thinking‚Ä¶ at the end of last year‚Ä¶‚Äù then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly ‚ÄúBut now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.‚Äù T said ‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶. okayyyy‚Äù in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added ‚ÄúMaybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about‚Äù. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 16512, distribution: 0.9731533804618687 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said ‚ÄúOk Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.‚Äù We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said ‚ÄúSo tell me about [something].‚Äù I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

Doc ID: 1627, distribution: 0.8923005598736738 ; Not sure why I have to say this for the literal th time but using ed recovery pro recovery or any kind of recovery tags on a blatantly triggering pro ed post doesnt redeem you for posting pro ed content. It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.
