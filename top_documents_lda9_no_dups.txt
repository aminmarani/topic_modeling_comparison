this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water    
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :)

Doc ID: 6996, distribution: 0.9963709289695885 ; happy taco bowl tuesday everyone 🥰🌮🥣the most nourishing of bowls that came together in under  minutes (!!). i love preparing different veggies, sauces, and grains at the beginning of the week to build bowls with each night. walking you through the prep that went into this one below. 

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - sautéed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream.

- cup diced carrots
-/ cup red lentils (rinsed and drained)
- cup tomato puree

- tbsp tomato paste
- tbsp red curry paste
-curry powder, sea salt, cumin

sauté the onion in oil, sea salt, curry powder, cumin, curry paste, and tomato paste until soft and fragrant. add the carrots and cook a few more minutes until tender. once the carrots are soft add in the remaining ingredients and cook on medium heat until you notice the lentils starting to soften and some of liquid be absorbed. here's the **trick** to thick: transfer half of the mix into a blender and puree until smooth, then add back to the pot (this is the secret to getting it extra creamy)! cook partially covered on medium heat for about - minutes with frequent stirring. .

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
- cup each of diced carrots and celery
- bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
- cups water
- cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don't stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Doc ID: 3146, distribution: 0.9950092280191672 ; Applications are now being accepted for the MEDA Memorial Scholarship. We are thrilled to offer this scholarship for the THIRD year. 🎉

This fund is solely designated for Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC). The proceeds will provide scholarships to Bachelor and Masters level students who are pursuing a degree in social work, psychology, or mental health counseling and who have a special interest in working with eating disorder recovery.✨

Despite similar rates of eating disorder symptoms, BIPOC are only half as likely to be diagnosed as compared to their white counterparts, and they face significant barriers to getting treatment. 

MEDA believes that by increasing the number of trained BIPOC social workers and mental health counselors, we will be better able to identify and treat all individuals struggling with eating disorders.

these fears can be SOOOO debilitating and can stop you from actually going for what you want, and BEING who you want to be.

when i peeled back the layers of each fear-based belief, i realized that they all stemmed from a common-thread belief that honestly sounded so illogical.

when i realized what it was and did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

❌“my parents are going to be so disappointed in me”

became➡️

✅“my parents love me unconditionally, and their reaction to my passion/path is not my responsibility. my decision to choose what i want over what they want is independent of my love and respect for them.”

❌“its too late to change my path, there's not enough time”

became➡️ 

✅“i don't operate on any one timeline. i can create what i want whenever i want. this is the game of life.”

❌“i might make the wrong choice and regret it”

became➡️ 

✅ “every choice i make leads me to a more compassionate & aware version of myself. the more i practice making choices, the better i get at discerning which will be best for me.”

❌“im not skilled/smart/capable enough to do it.”

became➡️ 

✅”I can do anything i set my mind to. what matters more than my SKILL is how much i ENJOY the process.”

❌“i will lose friends and connections in my community

became➡️ 

✅”i do not need to be understood. I have value to share. my ideal community is full of people who want to hear my message.”

Doc ID: 8873, distribution: 0.9970339699235087 ; advice/tips on handling being down/overwhlemed from the pandemic?

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup 🥰

Doc ID: 8698, distribution: 0.9969596938632939 ; trusting your intuition will CHANGE your life.

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right ones👁

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

❌our problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right path🌲no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

🙉you don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people… who would have known i “just” had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

🦋i have a few spots for : coaching in february 👀  so if you want to work with me this month to get clear on your purpose, drop your old ways, and build confidence in your direction, my application is in my bio and my DM box is always open🦋

Doc ID: 9506, distribution: 0.9968410323886288 ; not enough people talk about it, but being in your early 's is HARD.

growing up, i always dreamed of the early years post-college. we get told our early 's are “the best years of our lives”, and i fantasized about the new sense of freedom i'd have thinking i'd be working my dream job and having fun, going out, and being happy all the time.

don't get me wrong, i am very grateful for this life of mine and feel so blessed for the people in my life, the job i have, and the situation i'm in, but what i never realized was that being in this in between stage between being in school and having an established career and between being a kid and being an adult often feels frustrating, conflicting, and confusing as heck.

i've spent a lot of days the past few months feeling lost in life, anxious about not knowing my purpose, and terrified of the future because i have no idea what i plan on doing or where my path will lead me. but, on the days my mind is a little quieter, i'm able to reassure myself that

i don't need to have all the answers,
there's still so much time for me to become all that i'm meant to be,
what is meant for me will not pass me,
i do not need to prove my worth,
my best is always enough,
i deserve to give myself a break,
and there is so much peace to be found in the unknown.

sometimes, especially with social media and seeing people's highlight reels, it can feel isolating to feel this way, but talking to blake and some friends from school, i realize that these feelings are ones that a lot of us are feeling, and it brings me comfort knowing that i'm not the only one. so, to my fellow -something year olds:

you are not alone, and we will be okay.

disclaimer: i know not everyone follows the traditional life timeline, and there is no right or wrong way to go through life. it's okay and normal not to have it all together no matter what your age is or where you are in life. sending love to all beings.

Doc ID: 7141, distribution: 0.9968203490509665 ; these pictures are taken one year apart. aside from the fact that i'm still living in sweatshirts (🤠) a lot has changed.

when i posted the second photo last year, everything was unknown. i left school thinking i'd be home for a week or two. i had no idea how heavy the world would become for months, for a year. i had no idea that that my life as i knew it and the plans i had for the future would both be flipped upside down.

i remember taking that photo and feeling afraid. and i still am, afraid, sometimes. but hardship makes us stronger. i took the first photo today and felt changed. refreshed. like i've let go of so much.

this past year i've:

- finally closed doors on experiences that no longer serve me
- leaned deeply into relationships, and accepted that the need to be supported is not a weakness but a strength
- taken control over my own narrative, and chosen to see rejection as redirection
- worked on feeling secure in my person, my skin, and my beliefs

time heals. it really does. i think back to this time last year- i don't have everything figured out now, but i have found peace in places where i never thought possible. i'll always have work to do. we're always healing. change doesn't always have to be obvious or out loud. 

these pictures look similar but are deeply different. the internal work is the hardest. it's also the most rewarding. this year has been tough but i've found room to grow.  i'm proud of that. i have ways to go but ive also come far. 

i'm excited to meet the person i'll be next year, and the next, and the next 🦋🦋 taking a few minutes to reflect like this every so often is so healing for me 🙏

to those of you who are struggling and even THINKING about giving up, i see you, i feel you, i've been there, and after years of working damn hard on loving all of me, sometimes, i'm STILL there. i may not know you, but i can tell you that no matter what you are going through, you are not alone, and choosing to keep going even when it hurts so badly is so SO worth it.  you are important, your feelings are valid, and you are worthy of love, rest, help, and kindness even if the voice inside your head (or anyone else) tells you otherwise

vulnerability does not = weakness. vulnerability = STRENGTH. i choose to wear my story proud because dealing with mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, and i hope that sharing my story will make some of you realize that we are in this together.  remember to check in with yourself, your loved ones, and treat everyone with kindness today and everyday because you never know what kind of hurt the person standing right next to you is going through. sending you all love and hugs!

i'm a firm believer in things falling into place, things happening for a reason. always investing my trust in the universe or some higher power, whatever that may be.
.
.
but this doesn't mean i'm not intimidated by whichever next steps i inevitably face. .
.
i have so many passions and ideas and projects i want to pursue but worry i'm not moving quickly enough. i have so many roles i see myself excelling at but worry i'm not qualified enough. i worry about my resume. i worry about my gpa. i worry about my job performance and spending habits and my ability to plan for the future when living in the moment has been such a healing mindset for me this past year.
.
.
wherever i'm meant to be after graduation, i know i'll find my way. i don't expect things to work out instantly. i've always been late when it comes to these kinds of things. i spent six years of my life sick and alone before i started to live fully. six whole years behind my peers. but i got there.
.
.
when i get down on myself in moments like this i try to build myself back up. i know i'm resilient and can navigate hardship. i know i'm passionate and fully invested in creating something from nothing. i know i'm capable and dedicated. these are hard things for me to say. they feel selfish, obnoxious. .

Doc ID: 9525, distribution: 0.9964740574663064 ; if you look at this picture of me from this weekend visiting nyc, spending time outside, and thoroughly enjoying my ice cream, you aren't able to judge my emotional state or greater mental health picture, nor should you. 

when i'm going through a depressive episode, I don't lay in bed all day every single day, crying, trying to escape reality through netflix or sad music, and incapable of doing my daily functions. 

some days do look like that, but most days, i can get ready in the morning, i keep working, i interact with others, i smile and laugh, i do enjoyable things, i dance to music, and above all, i experience times of happiness.

one of the most irritating myths about depression to me is that all depressed people are sad all of the time and therefore, people who feel happiness can't be  experiencing depression even if they say they are. it's one look of depression that further stigmatizes the illness and causes many who are struggling with depression to feel trapped between engaging in the sadness and darkening everything around them in order to appear depressed to others and get recognition for it and putting on a face and performing the opposite because sad depressed people are “no fun”.

depression isn't an all or nothing deal, and it manifests itself differently in every individual and at different times.

i've been struggling a lot with my depression lately and have been having a hard time knowing what to say or do about it especially because to many, i don't “seem” like i'm doing that bad.  a reminder for me and maybe for some of you: you don't need to prove yourself to anyone. you only need from validation from one person, and that person is you.

Doc ID: 9454, distribution: 0.9964740574663064 ; last week, i unexpectedly lost one of the most important and present people in my life, my 外公.

my grandpa moved to america a couple days before i was born and was here for me as a constant source of love, strength, and joy for over  years. having lived in cleveland my whole life at this point, i feel so fortunate to have been able to spend a lot of time with family. while i feel very grateful to have gotten more time than many people do with my grandpa, there's so many activities, celebrations, milestones that just won't be the same without his presence.

the hardest part of experiencing grief the past few days has been facing a lot of feelings of guilt and regrets for all the things i could've said or could've done to show my grandpa i love him and make the most of my time with him.  i can only hope that he knew that i cared about him and appreciated all his small efforts and try my best to move forward, to remember how precious life is with every human interaction, and to give myself and others grace. i share this because grief is hard and uncomfortable to feel and to talk about, but it's also very real and something all of us experience at some point in our lives.

no matter what pain or hardships you are going through, it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to take time to feel your feelings, it's okay to do what you need to do for yourself. the rest of the world can wait.

i hope my grandpa rests easy, and his legacy lives on through many cherished memories and the strength he instilled in all the lives he touched. i love you, grandpa. you will forever be missed.

Doc ID: 8736, distribution: 0.9961980110717094 ; I never thought that becoming a doctor would make me miserable

Until the moment felt it

And if you don't get it, I will try my hardest to explain. 

But those of you could get it… You understood as soon as I said that. 

I was so confident in the current path that I was on. I was getting clinical experience as an RD, preparing for the MCAT, sprucing up my application to medical school so i could reach my goal as a preventative family physician.

I told everybody I knew that “I don't see myself ever changing my mind about this.”

And then one day, I DID exactly that. 

Some thing else called for me.

As much as I tried to resist it, I knew that if I continued on the path that was no longer for me… id live a life in misery. 

I had to make my choice. 

I compare this unexplainable feeling of change to the feeling a mother who just gave birth to her first baby (might) get. It's hard to describe but you just KNOW a shift has happened. 

it's strong, and it's real, and it's life-changing. 

If this is resonating with you, you know deep down that taking a leap will make even a short life worth living. 

So this is the time to get really honest about where you are. 

This is the time to be very compassionate with yourself, as this is not an easy spot to be in. 

And if you need support, I got you!

Ive helped dozens of women make this transition feeling empowered, satisfied, and confident with their next steps in life.

Doc ID: 6803, distribution: 0.9967818520999271 ; these brownies were *supposed* to make it to the thanksgiving table but i literally ate the whole batch the night before WHOOPS. they're that good 😏

this recipe is wild hahaha. the first layer is a rich, fudgy, cookie dough-like brownie bite. the middle is a decadent and perfectly sweet and salty mix of caramel pecan pie. and the third, in signature healthful fashion, is a hearty coating of thick chocolate. there's really nothing you won't love about these. did i mention the recipe comes together in under  minutes and there's no baking required? 

say less…

double fudge no-bake caramel pecan pie brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- - soft pitted dates
-  tbsp creamy tahini
- / cup raw pecans, finely chopped 

add the dates and tahini to a food process or blender and blend until a thick, sticky paste forms. this took about  minutes for me. at this point stir through the pecans until fully coated. transfer this layer to the base layer and spread evenly.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

in a microwave safe bowl, add  tbsp vegan cream cheese and  tbsp maple syrup. microwave for  seconds, then remove and mix thoroughly, scoop cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter, then swirl in using a toothpick. can swirl some through the batter before you pour it into the pan as well! bake for  minutes and let cool completely before serving!

Doc ID: 6715, distribution: 0.9962273875873227 ; probably one of the most decadent and dreamy desserts i've shared to date… pun intended 😗

FOUR ingredients… you're kidding. 

i promise you'll save this so fast hahaha. you must make ASAP. details below!

-ingredient chocolate stuffed brownie cups

brownie base:

- - medium soft pitted dates, soaked in boiling water for a half hour to soften (optional, but ideal)
- / cup cacao powder
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter  
add these three ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until a dough ball forms. you should be able to roll the dough out in your hands without it breaking. if it's too loose you may need to add a tbsp or two of water to thicken.

split the dough into balls and form a cup shape, making sure the center is deep and the edges are high. place these on a parchment paper lined plate and place in the freezer to set (about  min)

while the brownie cups are setting, make the chocolate filling:

- - medium soft pitted dates
-  cup chocolate chips/chopped chocolate of choice
-  tbsp hot water  
blend in the blender until smooth and silky. i left mine on the thicker side, transferred to a bowl, and whisk in another  tbsp of water (slowly) to smooth it out and make it a bit runnier. place the chocolate filling in the fridge to thicken up a bite while the brownie cups are still setting.

remove the cups from the freezer, dollop chocolate filling into each, and place back in the freezer to set. when you're ready to eat, let them slightly thaw for a few minutes or microwave for  seconds (so good this way). this recipe made  cups for me!

jumbo salted almond butter stuffed chocolate cups

chocolate layer: 
-  cup chocolate chips 
-  tbsp coconut oil
  salted almond butter filling:

-  soft pitted dates
- / cup salted almond butter
-  tbsp almond milk
- sea salt
- 
directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth.	emove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer. . . .

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.
