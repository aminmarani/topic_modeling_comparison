Learn how to set and respect boundaries, do what YOU want to do for YOU and be gentle with yourself on your journey. You're learning a lot, growing a lot, and it's going to be uncomfortable if it isn't already.”

that👆🏽 was one of the many “messages to my younger self” i got this weekend from the humans in this community who have passed their 's. 

Yesterday morning I had a download that social media can make it difficult for us in our formative years (and even after) to feel worthy. every time we open our socials, we're blasted with highlight reels of people who “have it together” and “figured out” and if we're not doing that too, it feels like a mirror of what we're NOT doing. and that's a shitty feeling.

i had a feeling that this wasn't an individual feeling so i reached out to ask what you'd tell your younger self and my suspicions were correct. 

this is a time of uncertainty, experimentation, and learning. what we're doing and how we're feeling is exactly where we're supposed to be. 

i know that being on social media can be overwhelming and can trigger unconscious expectations within ourselves. 

so i hope that this can serve as a reminder that the people who “have it figured out” probably went through the same shit you're going through. or maybe they're still going through it. we may never know!

either way, trust the process, enjoy the journey, and know that you have yet to experience more life and richness than you've ever imagined ❤️ 

hang tight. i'm with you. and so are all the other -something's.

it's that time of the year that can feel really crazy if you don't remember to slow down and take time for yourself.  with so much going on - family shenanigans, holiday festivities, work, finishing up this semester of school aka exams on exams on exams - it can be easy to get warped into the chaos of it all and forget that to be able to do it all AND stay present while doing it, you need to take care of yourself.
——
give yourself permission to take a break, do things imperfectly, say no, let go of the things that aren't serving you, and do what's best for you. your life is yours and not anybody else's, live it your way.

it's okay that you don't know who you are yet, this isn't your forever, and one day, you'll be able to genuinely say that you feel confident, at peace, hopeful, and free.

i'm proud of you. keep fighting.

love,
 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they're easier to deal with, and when good times come, they're more fully enjoyed.

it's moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i've come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

shoutout to everyone healing from things others don't know about, making progress that no one recognizes, and fighting battles others may not understand.

i see you. I'm proud of you. keep going.

Like there are a lot of people with EDs on tumblr, and most of them are romanticizing it; but you're being real about it, and it sounds like you're working to overcome your own, which is awesome. I dig your personality too, it's memorable and funny.  Answer: this ask is so fucking cool. positive feedback always surprises me, whenever i see i have an ask my gut falls into my ass bc i automatically assume the worst because im a lil outspoken but this is a relief n rly nice to hear! real is all i know how to be anymore, i just hope that showing ppl a fraction of my life n thoughts (how it rly is) might inspire them to improve their own relationship with food. i had a good day today, ate a lot of nutritious stuff, baked cookies - i feel good abt food today. i dont know if ed's are something that can be overcame but i do know you can evolve / coexist with them in order to keep yourself alive  and get healthier (physically and psychologically) and i just like to preach that the evolution is worth it. this is really sweet if u ever feel like makin a new friend u should message me because your personality and my personality would get along heeh!

Ok yes, these photos are a throwback to Los Angeles 😅🙈 Butttttt you guys, the UK is finally starting to brighten up, and with that I have definitely noticed that I am feeling a lot more optimistic 🤷🏻‍♀️
-
Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I have SAD, seasonal affective disorder, which is defined as depressive episodes that follow a seasonal pattern. But the weather does alter my mood for sure 🧬
-
SAD itself is thought to occur in roughly  million people in the UK alone, and those with this disorder typically show signs of low mood and reduced energy levels throughout the winter months.
-
Whilst research still needs to be done, seasonal mood fluctuations may be linked to the biology of serotonin: a neurotransmitter responsible for promoting happiness, pleasure and satisfaction 😊 Sunlight may, for example, regulate serotonin uptake into neurons (nerve cells) resulting in an increase in its activity in summer and a corresponding decrease in winter. Pretty cool, right 🤓
-
Research also points to the hormone melatonin, as well as vitamin D, but my advice regardless of the nitty gritty details is to get yourself outdoors!! If you're in UK right now, or you live somewhere and it's getting warmer, please please please take advantage of the sunshine 🌞👌🏻 Go outside, go and watch the sunset, or eat your breakfast under the sunshine one morning, because trust me, you'll feel a whole lot better for doing so 👏🏻

If you're also looking for the perfect hoodie for spring and summer then remember to check out the new @narnastore hoodies, and our bumbags are also perfect for this time of year too (ps: the code NARNA will get you % off your order) 🍌✌🏻

So I am thanking the weather this week and over the bank holiday weekend for inspiring this  #freedomfriday post ✨ Even though there are sometimes things you cannot do to easily change your mood, the spring feels definitely reminded me that I am always free to lift it slightly within a bit of sunshine, vitamin D and by getting outdoors 🦋

Ok if you haven't done the quiz yet on my story, it's fun (she says), and also do it before looking at this spoiler. Most of the questions you guys answered correctly, however the controversial questions were “what's my favourite food” and “do I do anything to my eyebrows” (which most of you answered wrongly 🤪). If I had to eat one food for the rest of my life, I'd definitely say oats, although that doesn't mean to say I don't love bananas and brown rice (and many other foods let's be totally honest here!!!). And about my eyebrows, my dude @lemonem_ily plucks them for me and actually loves doing that kind of stuff, so it's super useful for me. If I just left them to grow out, I don't know why, but my eyebrow hairs would grow all the way down on my eyelids (lol 😂). They therefore need taming. Also, when I've attempted to shape my own eyebrows I left a big hole in the middle of one of them 🤦🏻‍♀️😑 ... never to be done again!

I shook my head to say no, so she just checked in with how I was feeling about it. I said I was anxious but it felt like just normal anxiety now, not lost in all the extra layers of stuff from childhood. I summarised the anxieties I'd had and how I'd moved through them. At one point, T said “You've done enough work in therapy to know where *that* particular fear came from”. I do know, and now I'm feeling clear headed about it, I can see it was and is an ungrounded fear. But when I was stuck in the middle of it, I lost perspective on it. I couldn't see any other outcome than the one that was filling my head.  I hope that one of the things I can learn from this episode is that anxiety causes my brain to lie to me. I hope I can remember T's words, speaking truth to me and helping me ground myself back in reality. And if it's a new anxiety that I've not processed directly with her, I can remember the spirit of her words and try and imagine what she would say in the situation.

Answer: Such good questions!! . Right now I'm really excited about grad school. I'm working on my applications right now and to be honest, I don't even know if I can get in to these schools. But just the idea gets me really excited.. I think I'm most proud of picking myself up from a couple relapses and starting back to school. My therapist has been really emphasizing lately that I am the one who saved myself and I really love that. Ultimately, I am the one who got myself out of those dark places. . So many!! There's Warsan Shire's “I belong deeply to myself” that I love. There's a quote from a medieval mystic, Julian of Norwich, who said, “All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well” and I use that as a mantra sometimes when I get overwhelmed. There's also a Jack Gilbert poem that says:“We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure,but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must havethe stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthlessfurnace of this world.”. I have one tattoo (although I want more), going down my left arm, that says “got to kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight.” It's from a song and the full quote is “nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight…” My friend used to send me those lyrics when I was struggling and it just speaks to a never-give-up-ness to recovery that I value. . My favorite movie is called Mona Lisa Smile. It came out in  and it's about this feminist art history teacher who comes in to this really traditional school in the ′s and it's kind of Dead Poets Society-esque. It didn't get great reviews, but I still love it.

——
for a brief moment, i just wanted to scream, cry, get angry, crawl back into bed with a bag of chips for breakfast, and say 'screw it' to having a positive mindset.  but instead, i hit pause, took a deep belly breathe, gave permission to all these feelings inside of me to exist, and decided to start again...because a bad morning doesn't have to mean a bad day 🌞
——
i had a few extra hours this morning to sleep and then do things on my own time because i didn't have to go into work.
i saw my best friend @annaintheraw and picked up this delicious, loaded, and nourishing chicken avocado sandwich (on pretzel bread aka the best kind of bread there is) from her cafe.
my favorite things like raw vegan chocolate torte, puppies, ice cream, sunlight, and sweatpants exist.
i'm alive ✨

life is actually pretty beautiful, i have a lot to be grateful for, and there's so much more ahead.

.
restoring my physical health, rekindling a healthy relationship with food, nursing my mind back to peace. these were big changes. these are what i call on when asked how recovery changed my life.
.
i tend to forget the little changes. how once i got better, that deep, icy chill in my bones disappeared. how sitting in chairs and laying in a bathtub became moments of rest, not of agonizing tailbone pain. how i've earned the right to close my bedroom door for privacy. my parents aren't worried im sneaking in a third workout because now, i'm probably just napping instead. resting...i can do that, finally. .
.
i tend to forget the small shifts. how my mom monitored my meals less and less frequently, until, without saying it, she trusted me to stop throwing my dinner away. how i could wake up late for school and grab a breakfast i didn't spend days planning in advance. all without thinking twice.
.
and of course, there was the simple fact that when my life got better, so did everyone else's. how my sisters no longer feared being in the kitchen with me. my family stopped walking on eggshells in my presence. these days, the only eggshells we deal with are the ones scooped out of a brownie batter that we enjoy together...me included.
.
when i was recovering i gauged my progress by how close i was to attaining the big changes. qualities that i thought determined my success. my treatment team weighed me weekly, but never asked, “is it a little easier to look in the mirror today?”. this little hurdle took a jump, and it matters too. .
.
don't lose sight of your progress. so often we grow discouraged because we're not changing rapidly enough. what's one thing you can do today that would have destroyed you a week ago, a year ago? i'm proud of you for that.
.
because in the end, i have to ask: what do you think the big changes are made from anyway? all of the small ones, coming together, adding up...not so small after all, right?💫

🔸🔸🔸🔸🔸🔸🔸🔸🔸
okay, number two gets a little more attention. sunday is (usually) my rest day. there is so much stigma and discomfort surrounding the idea of rest days! whyyyyyyyy tho. you can't consistently push your body to its full potential if you're never giving it time to recover. taking rest days for me means coming into my next workout even stronger than i thought possible. i always get asked if i eat more on rest days. my answer? i don't eat more or less, i just continue to follow my food philosophy of eating what/how much my body needs. for example, i woke up at  am this morning with a grumbling stomach. normally i sleep until around  on sundays, but my hunger was keeping me up to the point where without realizing it i was standing in front of the open fridge at  🤷🏻‍♀️ eating this early means i'm probably going to eat more throughout the day versus another sunday, when i'd wake up much later. nothing to overthink or sweat over! my body was asking for food, and that's what i gave it. so i'll be sitting in the library all day instead of breaking a sweat? no difference. eating still works the same. hungry? eat. rest days always remind me of how far i've come in finally recognizing the importance of a healthy relationship with food and exercise. i used to think “active rest days” were perfect because my disorder loved the idea of still being active while irrationally believing i was doing myself good and not harm. active rest days don't exist. rest means rest. i'm not saying drop all responsibilities and don't move an inch for  hours, but a treadmill jog or long hike or something of the like is counterintuitive to what a rest day is meant to do. these are just my thoughts. i'd love to hear what you guys think! ❤️

Because it's all the small moments in my quiet, slow life in the mountains with my chickens, small 🍑 & wonderful fiancé that really fill my heart with joy.

I love working on our little farm SO MUCH. I love slow living, I love being self-sustainable, I love caring for my chickens & gardens, I love seeing it all flourish & bloom because of the love I pour into it. It brings me so much peace. I'm truly living my cottage core farm girl dreams! 🐣🌾🍅👩🏻‍🌾

The beauty is that “success & happiness” can look different for all of us! So… What's a joyful life to you? (Outside of all the noise & the pressure that society adds) I'd love to know, because it's so cool learning about how different we all are & about all the unique little things we all find joy in. Some of us dream of apartment-living in the big smoke, some find joy in reading, or plants, or talking about cars, or learning, some dream of travelling the world with no permanent address, others dream of living by the ocean, or a white-picket fence. You deserve to create a life that is truly yours, with small everyday things that bring you peace & joy. 

I know that any “dream life” is a huge privilege that is becoming increasingly harder to obtain, but I hope this inspires you to believe that you're worthy & capable of creating the life you dream of… & in the meantime, you can still incorporate some small joyful actions into your lifestyle now that bring you peace & fulfill you along the way 💞

We called by a local deli and picked up a sandwich each for lunch and a chocolate chip shortbread each too, and then headed out to our nearby countryside (staying local of course). Then we went on a  mile walk, which was slightly unintentionally longer than I planned because it was SO misty today that we couldn't see more than about  metres in front of us, and as a result I took us off on the wrong path at one point. Anyway, it wasn't a problem and it felt so good to get out together. We sat on a rock just over halfway and ate our sandwiches, for about  minutes till it got too cold to sit and we had to finish our sandwiches while walking. When we finally got home about pm, we had a pre-dinner drink from a new bottle of my favourite gin ever (see above) and opened our cards. d cooked us the most delicious evening meal (menu as above - all my favourites!) and in between the starter and the main course, we had to have a break to face time with d who is away at uni. It turned out that d had made us a video by messaging loads of our friends and getting them to send her video messages for us. It was absolutely fabulous! My sister and her family did their message popping up and down behind their sofa saying one word at a time each and it was so funny and went wrong so many times, that H and I were propping each other up laughing. Another of our friends made a whole message themed around board games which was so clever. I just got so emotional that so many people would take time to make us a message - and they kept so quiet about it and pretended to be all surprised if I ever mentioned to them it was our anniversary coming up! After watching the video, we finished our meal (and a bottle of Prosecco) and then chilled on the sofa with after dinner coffee watching the final episode of one of our Netflix binges.

what if instead of getting told, “you won't gain weight from one day of eating”, we were told, “it's okay if you do”? how would that change the narrative? how much less guilt or worry would we feel? how many more people would that help?

just some food for thought because even though i understand the rhetoric behind “you won't gain weight from one meal/day of eating” and know that it may help some people feel better, i also know from personal experience how harmful and guilt-inducing it can be too.

as we head into this week during that weird period between christmas and new years where it feels extra hard to do anything that's not laying on the couch, here are some reminders:

- what you've eaten recently has nothing to do with what you should eat today
- a changing, fluctuating body is a functioning, hardworking, resilient, and worthy body
- no matter how you feel about your body, you can choose to treat it with care and respect
- your purpose in life is not to keep trying to lose weight until you die
- you don't need to jump on the “new year, new me” bandwagon
- fresh starts are not reserved for january st
- it's okay if all you've felt like you've done this year is survive

🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹
i manifest this advice on a daily basis. i'm always finding new ways to grow and improve and, well, recover. recently, i've been making it a priority to truly listen to my cravings regardless of what i've eaten so far/planned for later. it's absolutely liberating. i've also been working out when my body feels like it, as opposed to when feels like i “should” be going to the gym. these small changes in the name of self-care have strengthened my mentality and my intrapersonal relationship greatly. a tidbit of my life i couldn't help but share! sending you all love ❤️

🙅🏻‍♀️ weight
🙅🏻‍♀️ body
🙅🏻‍♀️ looks
🙅🏻‍♀️ eating habits 

And if you're on the receiving end of those comments, it's so important to remember that you will NEVER please everyone! 🙊

At my biggest, people made comments on my weight. At my lowest, people made comments on my weight. And even now, somewhere in between, people make comments on my weight/body.

Swipe across to see what I mean 😅

People still tell me to this day that I'm too thin & I look sick. Even after all of the mental & physical gains I've made with my health. Even after gaining weight. Even though I eat anywhere from - times a day.

But this is PRECISELY why you really can't take on board what others say about you. Ultimately only you know the state of your health & mental wellbeing, so only you can judge... and even then, we tend to be the most critical judges of ourselves. MY GOSH, we really all need to cut ourselves some slack.

Here are some quotes that really resonated with me, I remind myself of these whenever I receive a negative comment online & it helps keep me grounded & distanced from their words:
🤍 “It takes grace to remain kind in cruel situations”
🤍 “A healthy mind does not speak ill of others”
🤍 “Hurt people hurt people”
🤍 “To belittle someone, you have to 'be little'”
🤍 “What someone says about you says more about them”
so I hope they might help you as well!

However I think if after the age of , they were working in a full time job or not in education of some sort and still living at home, we would have a discussion about paying rent or contributing to the cost of the household in some way.My relationship with d is the one I have to work at the most out of the three girls, but partly because she seems to want it the least. She is a different character to the other two. Then add in being a teenager on top of that. And the youngest of three so I think she naturally tries to grow up quicker than her age which results in some mismatches between what she wants and what she can have. She doesn't make life easy for herself, and I feel for her trying to find her way and trying to learn how to successfully navigate life and think about other people's feelings and understand consequences. I want to help her overcome these struggles but she is difficult to help! So it's a slow, gentle process that other people don't always think is happening as it should. I've learnt a lot about parenting and the sort of parent I want to be through therapy. Mostly through T “re-parenting” me to some extent. If I hadn't ended up in therapy, I would likely have continued parenting the way my parents parented me. I'm glad that I learnt a better way.I'm happy to be a bit of a surrogate tumblr mum xxx

Answer: my dad grew for a long time like + years & he didnt want to do it anymore bc its a lot of work. i took over his garden and had to bring all the plants he was neglecting back to life & i got rly good results so it kept my interest. i took over for the few patients he had and now i have my own in the mix too. the person im in a partnership with also showed me how to grow previous to this because we spent a few months living in / growing in a lake house a few years ago so i got to learn a lot before i ever even started myself. im lucky because i didnt have to throw down money for start up costs, all the equipment i have is old but it still works. all i had to do was nurse some plants back to life and pay the current maintenence which is still a lot of money lol. ive been doing it for a year or maybe a lil over a year but ive already faced quite a few challenges in the garden and learned more than i anticipated.

Even after I got to regularly eating three meals a day, I still needed big stretches of time for each meal. I wouldn't start breakfast or lunch if I didn't have a good  minutes to make and eat it. I also needed nobody else to be around while I was prepping or eating. These seemed entirely reasonable conditions to me, I couldn't focus on eating if I didn't have mental calm and space. If I didn't have that, I would just delay the meal until I did. Admittedly this did lead to me missing meals at times because the right moment to eat them just never came round and then it would be too late. I had so many arguments with my therapist over this because she said it was the eating disorder and I said it was just lack of time. Anyway, update, I can now make and shovel down my breakfast scrambled eggs in about  minutes flat if I need to (I could be quicker if they weren't so hot that they burn my mouth when first cooked), and I've learnt that lunch just has to happen no matter whether the window to make it is before pm or falls when the kitchen is full of other people. It still is my preference to have space and peace for meals but it's not a deal-breaker anymore.

But the showcase im bringing it to wont let us hang on the walls so i might need to build a stand for the frame so its raised to match the installation.. Hmmmm. I also bought myself a pair of shorts. All i have are really short pairs and im not % comfortable with that yet, so i got a pair of bike shorts.. Like.. Leggings that are shorts. Never owned a pair before. But i saw a cool red pair and now they are mine. Soon. All of my  concert plans have officially canceled so im fucked up about that. Live music is incredibly important to me and my mental health and i rely on them to keep me going.. Because when shit hits the fan, at least i have a show coming up. But now i got nothing.

Simply loving, respecting and being kind to yourself and your own body *is* self-care. In fact, to me self-care means taking more time to indulge in the things you love. Walks in nature, painting, dancing, watching a movie with a friend . . . anything!!!🌻 Whilst it can be a fancy face mask and candlelit bubble bath if you enjoy that, self-care is so soooo much more than that ✨

I personally like to use them alongside my menstrual cup instead of pads or panty liners on my heavier days, as it is so much better for the planet 🌎 My favourite pair are the Hugger knickers, but there are loads of different styles to suit everyone and different period flows! You guys can also get % off using my code VEGANHOLLY so definitely check them out 💖

I'm also coming at you with some more beginner vegan tips, or again, some advice if you're just trying to reduce your animal food consumption and eat more plants 🌱🤩
-
: The more colour in your meals, the better!! It means more vitamins, minerals and helps you to create that healthy balance that we want, so eat the rainbow my friends 🌈
-
: I'm not a cheese gal. But I know a lot of you guys out there would tell me you just can't stop eating the cheese 🧀😅 Firstly, it's ok!! Lots of people struggle with this, but I'd recommend trying different vegan cheeses until you find at least one you really like as there's now loads to choose from! Oh and ps: a word of warning from me, I think vegan cheese smells A LOT stronger than normal cheese 😂
-
: Meal prep, meal prep, meal prep. If you're starting to find staple, plant-based meals that you enjoy, then make a batch for dinner and save leftovers for lunch the next day. This is especially useful if you're busy or on-the-go! ⏰
-
: For those of you allergic to nuts (I feel for you, I really do 😢), but it is still possible to be plant-based or vegan without them! To get in those healthy fats, I'd go for seeds, like hemp, chia and pumpkin seeds, instead, try seed butters (yes, they exist!!) and also avocados. You might still be able to eat coconut as well, depending on your intolerances 🥥
-
: For those of you looking to just make one single swap today or by the end of the month, replace cow's milk with a plant-based alternative. This is a really quick and easy swap, and you can start making your teas, coffees, matcha lattes, cereal, oats, cakes etc etc etc with something that's better for the planet, the animals and your health 🌍

i've always been a sensitive person, so something that has taken me a while to learn is the importance of protecting your energy.  a big part of that means being picky and choosing to only surround myself with people who respect my space and also serve my greatest gold. BUT, you don't always get to pick and choose every single person around you, and rather than just get angry at and take to heart everything that people from your coworkers to family who might have good intentions say, i think there is so much peace and value that can be found when you are able to listen to opposing points of views, think about why you disagree, *sometimes* share your thoughts, and walk away not feeling unworthy, but rather more confident in your beliefs.

it took me a long time to be able to treat noise as just noise, and even now, there are times it penetrates into my mind a little.  so, even when you don't always believe it, YOU ARE WORTHY, and your worth does not decrease based on somebody else's inability to see it

It is located off the coast of Townsville and highly worth the visit for sure. I took the time to explore a lot of the the hiking trails, beaches and bay areas all on my own.

Out of the context of a tour and without a tour guide, I definitely feel like a proper solo traveller 😉 It gives you more freedom to do what you want and make your own plans each day, however having said that, I've honestly loved all the tours I've done so far. Since it was my first time travelling solo, I've also felt more comfortable being in a tour group, and it's definitely allowed me to build up my confidence as a young backpacker.

If you watched my story yesterday, there's a little chat coming up in the next episode all about how I've found travelling alone and whether I've felt safe or not. Yes, and unfortunately, there have been times when I didn't feel comfortable at all. It wasn't anything serious, and I managed to get myself out of each situation pretty easily, but sometimes you can feel a bit unsafe when travelling, especially alone. Quite ironically however, on all occasions I was actually in a public space with lots of people around!

So yes, I've wanted to talk about safety for a while and I finally found the time to do it the other day (in a  bed mixed hostel room actually too 😅). Things like: where do I keep my passport?

Doc ID: 14914, distribution: 0.16228220163408769 ; Question: Hi Faith :)) What was the environment around food like for you growing up? Answer: Ugh it was awful. Almost every negative thing you can think of related to food went on in my house. My mum dieted, she tried to get my dad on a diet - endless different diets. There was shaming around weight. Fat shaming. Good food and bad food. Lots of talk over numbers of calories and fat in food. Guilt over being hungry and being told “oh you can't possibly be hungry”. Commenting on what people were eating. Mealtimes were stressful, a place where we were always told off for table manners, high anxiety, often ending in shouting (my dad) and crying (my sister and I). My dad did a lot of secret eating and my mum had tight control of the kitchen and knew what food had gone. She hid food to stop it being eaten. We had to ask permission before we could get anything to eat. Sometimes if my mum was away for the day, I was left in charge of making sure my dad didn't eat any bad things. My dad was delighted at being left on his own and would take us out for lunch and eat very indulgently, leaving me caught in between my parents actions. If we went out for a family meal, my dad would eat too much and my mum would look in great pain having to watch him, she would be wincing and pulling faces and commenting.Looking back on it all in therapy, it is of absolutely no surprise that controlling my eating became the coping mechanism I ended up using to manage my feelings. Eating was connected with such high anxiety and so polarised already that it was only a small step to falling into unhealthy behaviours. The one positive is that it has made me absolutely % clear on what NOT to do with my own children.

I never actually saw myself as someone who enjoyed hotter weather, sunshine and the beach lifestyle. But I can % say that I'd be in shorts over trackies any day. In Australia I just simply got used to putting suncream on every day and by the end of my trip it really didn't bother me anymore. I also think that it felt like a different kind of heat to the UK. It's part of the culture there in Australia so the country is prepared for it, whereas on that one day in the UK each year (if we're lucky) when we have a  degrees C heatwave ... everyTHING and everyONE shuts down; we all start complaining; there's no air con; all the Brits go to town on the sun bathing and we burrrrrrrrn like bacon, no word of a lie 😂 Having said all that, I do quite like my beanie at the moment ngl, and it helps to cover up my hair when it's a bit too frizzy for my liking. @narnastore I see potential there…

Aside from the weather, I am definitely finding my feet back home and feeling busier than ever, which I love!

Swipe for a surprise HAHA happy real me Monday! Thanks for being here as I kickstart each week with a dose of reality 🌈

These photos are here because I want you to SEE that the things you wish away from your body don't actually have an impact on your worth or value & as much as you don't see it in yourself, these parts of you can be beautiful. Sometimes we just need to see things through a different lens. Have you been hard on yourself lately? If you have, leave a '🙋‍♀️' in the comments... This is for you: YOU ARE AMAZING. Believe that & embody that. The way you speak to yourself matters!

Fun fact: I used to delete all of the natural, candid, relaxed photos like the ones on the right straight away & tbh just seeing myself that way would've ruined my whole day, even some of the photos on the left would've been deleted too, because I was sooo overly critical of myself & which version of me should be showcased on social media. 

Now? Those are my favourite kind of photos. They're ME at my most vulnerable, when I'm having fun, when I'm relaxed, when I'm really enjoying my life. These are the moments I'll look back on with a smile. None of my best moments & favourite memories happen when I'm holding my breath & tensing so hard I could poop myself 💩 

These photos are the ones that make me feel happy & they're also the ones that don't make others feel worse about themselves. It's a win win 🎉 

There is SO much more to life than comparing, punishing yourself, picking yourself apart, sweating the small stuff, caring more about what others *MIGHT* think of you rather than prioritising how you WANT to live your life & how you actually FEEL about yourself. 

So ask yourself right now: 
. What's important to me? 
. How do I want to live my life? 
. I can either view myself through a negative lens or a positive one, which lens am I going to start choosing?

Chat with you in the comments!! 🤗

A physical jolt of dread. I have to glance into the back seat to reassure myself that the baby is there.  “But that's ok to check the baby is there, it only takes a couple of seconds to glance back, but I can't keep trying all my clothes on every time I have a leg panic…. and besides, not forgetting the baby is important but I want to not care about the size of my legs! I am so much more than the size of my legs!” “OK” said T, “let's go with that. You know I like my positive statements. What positive things about yourself can you say instead?” She pointed out that it's good to have statements about being, not doing. Because eventually in life we won't be able to 'do' but we will always 'be'.  I talked about how I can appreciate my legs for what they can do, for being strong and able to walk and run and carry the baby around. T asked me what “I am” statement I could make about that. It was hard. My brain panics and goes blank, a hangover from being a child and being put on the spot and knowing there was always a “right answer” but not knowing what it was. She had to help me out but we got three statements. • I am someone who values trying to stay healthy and keep fit • I am someone who cares for others • I am someone who understands and values the need for babies to develop good attachments  T said the way to retrain my brain was that every time I felt that panic about my legs, I had to think those statements. I agreed to give it a try. I said it felt better than trying to reassure myself that my legs were still the same size, because doing that just reinforced to me that the size of my legs was important. And honestly, I would really rather not care about the size of my legs. I feel so shallow when in the midst of everything going on in the world, I am here crying over the fact that my thighs might be mm bigger than they used to be. That is not in line with my values at all. It's time to get my brain to catch up.

I said what I'd realised is that my mum says things like this in normal conversation, like it's not an outrageous or contentious things to say. She has been doing this all my life and for a lot of that time, I have accepted what she said as fact. I was so busy aligning myself with her and absorbing her opinions as my own that I never questioned the rightness of them. I said to T that hearing my mum speak like that actually helped me have a bit more compassion for myself. That I still feel a lot of shame over developing an eating disorder and I still think “I'm so stupid”. When I hear my mum say things like that and realise that she's been saying them all my life and I've just been soaking them up as fact, I think it's no wonder that I got mixed up ideas about food and size.  T said “Absolutely! There is no shame in you developing an eating disorder. I'm not surprised at all that you developed an eating disorder. In fact, given everything, I would have been surprised if you *hadn't* developed an eating disorder.” The truth is, I didn't really stand a chance in developing healthy thoughts and beliefs about food and weight. I'm trying to hold on to that belief. T's words make me feel a bit less stupid and shameful.  I paused and thought about this, and T said “It looks like something is simmering away in your brain there…” I said “Well, it's like two viewpoints of it isn't it? Over here there's you saying it's understandable and no shame in it. But over here is everyone else looking in from the outside, seeing a perfect family and nice parents, and wondering what could possibly be wrong. That's where the shame lies.” T said, really powerfully, “Ah but they don't know your story. You have invited me in to your childhood. So I can say from that place of knowing you, that it's understandable and there isn't any shame in it.” I replied “Uh uh… I guess I worry too much about what the other people think though.” T said that is also understandable from growing up the way I did, that I didn't ever learn to trust my own feelings and spent my time trying to work out what I should feel based on what everyone else felt.

this one was a YEAR for me. i didnt think i'd make a year review but i'm glad i did because i forgot so much happened over the past year.  i've been making this all day, trying to think of what to write but all i could come up with was GRATITUDE for all that's happened:

🏠Luke and i moved into a new place
💉i continued my path to med school by studying for the MCAT 
❤️‍🩹my skin broke out really hard- almost screaming at me to re evalute the road i'm going down 
🧶i slowed down and started to tap more into what activities and hobbies bring me joy 
🦋i realized med school at this time just wasn't it for me and it seemed like letting that go (along with the familial/self/societal pressure) was what my body was asking me to do as my skin began to relax
🐶we welcomed @kiaralovepup into our hearts
🧘🏻‍♀️i continued to practice yoga & meditation as my daily grounding
🦠hung out with Miss Rona for a few days 
🕊i said “see you later” to one of my aunts and my lola (grandma)
👯‍♀️i spent more time with my radiant incredible friends who inspire, uplift, and support me as i do them
✨i finally began to embody myself in my work: obtained my reiki & certificate, enrolled in an Ayurveda Practitioner program & Dharma Coaching Institute, and more
💒we attended a few weddings
💍 i said yes to forever with my favorite human being in the entire world 

beyond this, i've been working on healing my relationship with social media. we are all here for a reason & i truly believe that this, like any tool, can be used for the greater good. as @mariannewilliamson quotes (my favorite quote ever!),

“We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. 

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you... And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”

cheers🥂 to another year of growth, change, expansion, &liberation

Doc ID: 17222, distribution: 0.7783429768626302 ; Years ago, early on in therapy, my therapist asked me if I had thought about whether I might have autism. (She'd taken some things I'd said to her peer supervision group and they'd asked her about it) I hadn't thought about it, I didn't think I had it, and I was quite upset with her at the time for suggesting it. Since then, it's become much more well known that girls can often show different traits of autism to the “classic” ones we became familiar with over years gone by. However I have no interest in getting a diagnosis. I don't want a diagnosis even if I were to meet the criteria (I have no idea if I do)  But one thing I know I do is have a very black and white approach to situations. If I think someone or something is “breaking the rules” it really niggles at me. My heart races and I can't think about anything else and I feel compelled to do something about it. Which then stresses me out and makes me more unhappy than the people who are breaking the rules in the first place. (They generally don't care!) Recently I've started recognising when I get in this position, all outraged about something being “wrong”. I remind myself that not everyone would find this situation so outrageous. My heart may be racing and I may be feeling unable to think about anything else until this is put right, but I've learnt this isn't how most people feel in these sort of situations. They might feel some mild irritation or frustration but then they move on. So I'm trying to practice letting it go. Accepting that other people make their own choices. Reminding myself that's their responsibility. My feelings may be demanding I “fix it”, but that's my responsibility and I can calm those feelings down rather than need to act on them. I'm not sure where this post is going really, other than it's a thing I've been thinking about and noticing the last few weeks especially and I always think back to T saying “do you think you might have autism?” and me thinking “no way are you pinning that on me” (I know some people find it really helpful to have a diagnosis but that isn't me.) so I will teach myself to manage these moments because I believe that will make my life easier and more pleasant.

 Im going to bring you on my journey to defeat my eating disorder. I'm going to do a weight loss journey, a healthy eating journey at some point and a kind of journal for my ED thoughts and what its telling me to do each day. It has been better because of the quarantines due to not having access to getting foods for a binge, but I was to get rid of the thoughts completely. This will also go through my thoughts for my depression and anxiety, and ill document how these are affecting progress. A lot of my anxiety at the moment is not wanting to admit to my family that I want to begin working out but that should be easily compatible, the other part, of people seeing me exercising, and by that what they think when they see me will e something I keep a very close eye on and also make note of in separate entries. There will be no measurements included. I won't say what im doing to lose the weight as I don't want to trigger anyone suffering from anorexia that involves working out, but I will include how much I have lost overall every so often so as to give an update but no time frames, again so as to not be a trigger. I have a feeling this will be a long journey but im willing to commit and bring anyone that wants to join me/ follow me on it. I wish everyone suffering from EDs the best during this tough time and I hope you too can defeat it and start living instead of surviving. XX

The first friend I confide to was very understanding, she listened, offer her support and was basically another shoulder to lean on. That sparkled joy. THE SECOND ONE THOUGH, omfg it didn't sparkle joy. She reacted soooo indifferent it hurt, she told me it was obvious and that she already knew and that she was glad i realised i had a problem, everything in the most condescending voice, almost like a “here's a star for doing a good job”. I–… It got better eventually, and she is a good friend and someone that actively checked on me and made sure i ate.  
 The rest didn't get their private conversation, those two made sure everyone in my friend group at the time knew and i was happy for that, I didn't know how to approach the topic so it was like a weight lifted of my shoulder. 

I think the one i hated telling the most was my then friend now boyfriend because of HOW I told him. He was a few weeks away from going abroad to study, so i basically cornered him at recess and said “I'm anorexic and I will start therapy soon. Okay? I just wanted you to know before you went away. Byeeee! I have class in five” and just like never spoke about it until a year later when he asked me if he could have the full story so i told him, and he became one of my main supporters and cheerleaders, i am very grateful to have him :)

I knew not everyone was going to understand, or that some would need more time than others, but like, if i had a heads up that telling people around you about your ed is hard it would've been nice hahahaha. I don't regret it, these are people that provide some sense of comfort. 

So yeah, me from the past just, idk, you always have the need for everything to me in line and according to how you want it, with people's emotions though? that can't always be possible. 

But, if they are truly your friend, they won't go away because of your ed :)

Doc ID: 8979, distribution: 0.8409873802222649 ; here it is!!! a short lil review of my Gardyn experience! keep in mind that this IS a #sponsored post, but ALL opinions are my own. i've been very into the idea of gardening and growing my own vegetables but ) i don't have a green thumb- i killed every succulent i've owned and ) i don't have space in my lil apartment or the lil courtyard we have in front for even a raised bed garden. SO enter Gardyn 

the truth: grow lights were really bright all the time and the water kept flowing at first BUT i realized that i needed to change the setting on my phone as it connects to an app so now it waters at  am,  pm, and midnight everyday. i made the light settings to be according to my sleep wake cycle so it's not bright when it shouldn't be & honestly the grow light was HUGE because we have such a dimly lit apartment

i honestly didn't expect this to satisfy my needs bc lets be honest ya girl can eat a whole head of grocery romaine in one sitting if she can so i was like “ya okay it looks like a cute accessory” but SHE. KEEPS. GROWING. so much and so fast that I've had to stop buying greens at the store (ok im saying it like it's a bad thing but remember i had so many DOUBTS about how this could sustain my love for greens) AND harvest and share with my family because i didn't want the greens to go bad

it's not messy, not noisy, enhances the look and feel of my living space, and it's so fun to watch my little plants grow and grow and grow. i've already sold MYSELF bc i want to buy one for my mom as a gift eventually… she doesn't have an IG so it's safe here haha

the only con that i have is that it's pretty pricey so it's not really one that i would get if i were tight on $$. but if you have the $$ to spend, want a garden but don't have the space for it, then this would be a good option! i'm happy with it and excited to see how it turns out a year from now

you can get $ off with “amandasevilla” i also posted a YT video with it (& a kitchen tour) so you can see it in actual video and hear some specific questions i got about it so make sure you check it out:

 sure i could starve myself to death to take my mind off the fact that the men in my life are constantly making me feel awful for existing. starving slowly is certainly a lot easier than finding the means to kill myself instantaneously (which has proven to be difficult for me over the years).. but what will that do for me besides make me feel worse. it wont make anyone that makes ME feel bad feel bad.. it's not like anyone will care or notice, and even if they do - they wont be caring or noticing for the right reasons. people just wouldnt take me seriously, they might feel uncomfortable or pitiful, or even disappointed.. but thats not the same as understanding or respecting where i'm coming from. alas, its futile punishing myself and compromising the health i have left. 
 i think if you're a woman its just kind of a given that you'll never be understood or respected.  
 and i just get to deal with that on my own, with only my fictional characters for friends. i wish i could give up on myself, unfortunately im old enough to know better that i cant. idk what to do with myself. i feel like i cant really talk about wanting to starve and die on here because it doesnt set a good example and i always preach heavily about how hurting yourself ain't worth it, and i still stand by that.. but i'm human & i still live with my tendencies. eating disorders never truly go away, they just evolve as you do and you have to learn how to coexist with them.  coexisting aint always easy.  
 i guess ill stop now i dont want to trigger anyone by going into more detail. kinda ironic,  i made this blog to go into detail / share my ups & downs because i dont have anywhere else to but now i just feel the need to protect my vulnerability and to not influence anyone else by being self destructive. sigh

Doc ID: 8030, distribution: 0.4282259564000045 ; i always thought that once i recovered from my eating disorder, my life would be perfect.
.
maybe that's because in comparison to living with my disorder, anything in its absence was better. life after recovery meant freedom from the ills that plagued me on a daily basis. life would be perfect.
.
i've been “recovered” for years. i don't believe in absolute recovery from an ED. i know this is a controversial topic, but ill always stand by the notion that recovery is a lifelong commitment. life after recovery means that what was once a blaring siren of a voice is now a faint whisper that surfaces with less and less frequency.
.
you learn to hear that whisper and understand that it's an old behavior creeping up, an ancient thought, a past fear. it's small enough and you're strong enough to recognize its presence and then show it the door.
.
that's what life after recovery is. it's learning to live beyond the confines of what used to hold you captive.
.
what it's not, is perfect.
.
i was convinced that i would recover and my life would do a . that once i was past my behaviors, had restored my mental imbalances and physical body back to health...that then i'd be just like everyone else. my friends and family i used to watch from a distance, living their best lives in good health.
.
what i failed to realize then was that  after recovery i was still subject to being human.
.
i mess up, a lot. i hurt people and i regret it. i lose my temper, i let fear stop me from exploring new things. i say no when i should say yes, and sometimes i agree too quickly. the hardships of life after recovery are just hardships of life, and that was a fact that failed to sink in for a long time.
.
nobody leads a perfect life. when it comes to recovery, we hold high expectations for ourselves. we want it to be “worth it”, and fear settling for a life that's less than perfect.
.
all i know is that being rational is the hardest endeavor while suffering from an ED. the entire illness is characterized by irrationality. but being mindful of your humanity, understanding that life will be hard here and there, that a bad day isn't a bad life...that is the best you can do.

in a world where it's really common to see influencers/content creators/coaches live far from their families & parents, living in my hometown and WITH my parents can sometimes put me in the mindset of being the odd one out in the creator space. 

when i was in high school i was so convinced id never move back to my hometown.

when i was in college i was so convinced i would work far from home once i got a job. 

and now i'm here, doing the complete opposite, and im so happy. 

i'm sharing this to say that living with your parents or in your hometown doesn't have to be this big “failure” or “setback.” it's just not the “common” thing we see on social media. 

we're surrounded all day by media that portrays “that” life…  but please don't forget that you're never required to move at the same pace as “everyone else.” 

what you want in life wants you too, but the timeline and road to get there may change depending on the inner work that is required. 

i feel super grateful to be here, to know that i am choosing to spend time with them, 

and to know that this phase, too, in my life, will pass. 

and i'll be looking back with love for the time and space i got to spend with presence and persistence❤️

 having a mental illness is such shit. it's not edgy or dramatic or cool to have scars on your legs because you started cutting when you were . it fucking sucks to never be able to accept offers of sweets or treats from someone you like because you are too scared. it's annoying to be this jumpy and easily scared when you're supposed to be an adult and act like it. panic attacks are scary and weird, doesn't make me feel more likeable, i'm just ashamed. all i am as a person is such a mess, a traumatized mess with maladaptive coping mechanisms and trust issues oh yeah, where'd the great mood go?

I wasnt close to my mom at that age but now I'm older and much closer to her as an adult. I know there are other factors and this is oversimplifying it. You are a great mom and I'm sure she knows that you are there for her and you care and always will be and that's what matters most.  Answer: Thankyou. There definitely a contrast with d and d, and I do try and remind myself often that a lot of it is standard teenage behaviour and a lot of that is due to the changes and growth that goes on in the teenage brain. I'm holding onto hope that it will get easier eventually but sometimes that feels so far away. And I worry that there's no guarantee it will get easier and what if we do the wrong thing now which just ends up in her being even more distant in the future. When do you fight for the relationship and when do you step back and give space. Thankyou for your encouragement x

Growing up, I rarely thought twice about whether someone liked my outfit or heard me fart in the changing room (yes, I've done this and yes, people definitely heard 😅😂). I just lived my best life and to be honest with you, that's the way it should be! But I've also had my fair share of tears, tissues and time spent *wasted* (please let me emphasise) on caring too much about the judgement of others. They'll tell you you're ugly, you're ignorant, you have no life living at home. And wowwwww I've definitely fallen into the trap of believing all of it. Every. single. word!!! 😭
-
Now the sad reality is this: people's words and people's actions can be vile, cruel and completely unnecessary. And it's not easy to not care, I know all too well. But what you can start doing, from today, is making a conscious effort to stand your own ground. Focus on yourself. Love yourself, and remind yourself that what other people think does not define you. Embracing what you look like, who you are and how you choose to live your life every day is *the best* form of self care, like ever 🙌🏻

So cheers to showing all the critics, the jealous friends, the haters and maybe even that voice inside your very own head that we do not care what they think, and most importantly, that we're definitely not going to change because of it 🥂🤩

truthfully, i wanted to workout more days this week to clear my head in between studying, but chose going on a spontaneous ice cream trip or watching an episode of masterchef instead, and i wanted to eat out less after coming back from a few days of travel, but chose to go out for food with friends during this last week before winter break.  i don't have any regrets because a huge part of what living a healthy, balanced, and free life to me is the ability to be fluid and flexible with my choices and also trust that my body's on my side
——
it's okay if you want to workout regularly and have preferences for food, but also know that it's okay to not always workout when you want to and to eat things you might not exactly want. the interesting thing with food freedom is the more i practice it, the more i realize it was never about food in the first place. give yourself permission to surrender control when it comes to the things you eat because food freedom allows LIFE FREEDOM 🤘🏽, and you deserve to live a life that is full, vibrant, and free. happy saturday, friends! xx

Habits that helped me gradually recover from Major Depression: Baby Steps Edition Disclaimer: Implementing these changes into your life does not mean instant or guaranteed recovery, but they can aid in therapy and are generally a good place to start when you want to get out but are so deep in the rabbit hole that you don't know how. For me, they made the general act of living and staying alive so much more bearable, over several years, I might add. - Purge your social media! This can be a gradual process. Every time you come upon a picture that depicts self harm, a sad quote, anything that makes being sick into a desireable aesthetic, unfollow the blog that posted it. When depressed, social media is one of the things that requiere the least energy to do, so it's important you only follow blogs that lift you up. For me that's pretty food pictures, cats, renaissance art and mediterranean aesthetic. - Stop consuming violent media. This ties in to the step above, but sometimes I'd find that watching shows with a lot of fights, violence, drugs and blood also put me in a bad mindset. If you must binge watch to cope, like I did, watch childrens cartoons, or wholesome comedy series like The Office or Brooklyn Nine Nine. The things we look at online have a lot of effect on our thoughts.This also means no gore and no violent or degrading porn. - Never say no to a social event. Always chose to be around others, if possible. Following this rule has made me much more outgoing, less anxious, and made me spend less time on my own, alone with my thoughts. This obviously doesn't mean go to parties every weekend, even though you hate them, or drag yourself out of bed even when you're sick! - Stop engaging in destructive relationships. I slowly stopped hanging out with all my friends who did drugs, self harmed and were depressed and reconnected with old friends I had lost contact with while I was very sick. It is hard to recover when you're constantly around mentally ill people, who also don't handle life well. I'm not saying drop all your friends, I'm saying be around people you can use as an example, who are neurotypical, who can bring you back to reality and show you how “normal people” manage things. - Clean living space! For about a year, I lived in a dark room. Why was it dark, you might ask? Because I absolutely could not stand the mess, I didn't wanna see it, I couldn't clean it either, so I only ever went into my room with the lights turned off. It made such a difference when I finally cleaned it in a rare moment of motivation. I suggest first tidying up your bed, then the floor, then gradually all surfaces and lastly cupboards and the wardrobe etc. Just having a free floor makes all the difference sometimes. I'd suggest watching room makeovers on Youtube or Marie Kondos Tidying Up for motivation. I might add, change doesn't happen over night. It took me roughly four years to get from laying in my dark room in my bed all day, surrounded by my own filth and skipping school more often than not, to being content almost every day, not wanting to cry upon waking up and only ever so often having a bad day. I am still mentally ill and probably always will be, but I am so glad I made those changes all those years ago, and slowly, but surely the pain I felt every day got a bit less and less. If you have any questions, feel free to DM or ask me.

I told her I'd signed up on impulse for a half marathon, and that I hope that I could train for it in a healthy way. We talked about what it might look like if it wasn't a healthy way. I said not taking rest days, running more than my training plan. She said what about if you start losing weight? You know you'll need to eat more to fuel more running. I said eating more was… difficult. We had a bit of a back and forth about that. I said I was very motivated to be able to train well and run fast and that I did think I would be able to eat adequately to do that.  T said I would need to keep an eye on my weight and I said uh actually, I want to stop weighing myself. Because I've done it every week for a year now and it's starting to feel more unhelpful than helpful. It just keeps me fixated on the number and I can't stop my urges to make it go down, no matter what it is.   I said that last year my weight had ranged over  lbs and I knew what that felt like and I would recognise if it moved outside that. T said “I think you are a good weight at the moment”, which was and is hard to hear. It definitely makes me aware of a part of me that still wants people to be concerned about me because I am “too thin”. There is a big part of me that is really really proud of myself for getting rid of a load of eating disorder behaviours, eating regularly, exercising in a healthy way and engaging in adult life as an adult. Life is so much better with all these things in place. But there's still that little part that wants to be looked after and taken care of and doesn't like to hear “hey you're doing really well, we don't need to worry about that anymore”. Anyway, that is my self awareness which I can use to understand why I feel certain ways while also knowing that I don't need to act on it. T was understanding of my wish not to weigh myself so often, and she said that towards the end of last year she thought I had got a bit hyperfocused on the numbers again, so maybe it would be a good idea to step away from them. I do imagine I'll still weigh myself, but maybe only once a month or so, and just to see if it's still in the range rather than getting caught up in the exact numbers. We finished off by talking a bit about goals for the year. T suggested a goal that I would know what I was feeling in my body and how that related to my emotions. I'm a bit unsure what exactly she means but I'm happy to go with it. Then we got on to talking about finishing therapy, which I wrote about in a previous post, and that was the end of the session.

 it's scary how something that happened so long ago still affects me right now. most of the time i don't even think about it, but it also seems to be all over me, does that make sense? my severe jumpiness is known to everyone, i've legitimately fallen to the ground and half under a table at work once - because one of my coworkers suddenly entered the room quite fast and it startled me. me falling or jumping away or flinching is a super regular occurence at this point. only a few trusted people are allowed to touch me, otherwise i get uncomfortable as hell, leading up to feeling paralyzed and in shock with a following panic attack in the worst case. sudden noises or people (especially men) shouting/following me/running towards me scare the shit out of me. i can't stand anyone being behind me really and i can't sit with my back towards doors/open space without going mad, i always look out for escape routes instinctively. it's a part of me at this point, yes my poor girlfriend … despite being careful and understanding and all, sometimes a single move can send me straight into a flashback, meaning i curl up into a ball and completely lose touch with reality while sometimes shaking or crying, reliving it in my head or just disassociating. in this state i absolutely cannot be touched, else i just move away from whoever touches me in blind panic and it gets worse. last time a blanket was put around my shoulders, i apparently got off from the bed head first and curled up at the wall, looking like a bunny in panic. it's not technically my fault and i am aware of that, but i feel so very bad about it still. i keep reassuring her that it is not her fault when i snap, and i'm working on communicating more clearly what i need/when i am not okay with something. she keeps telling me it's okay and i don't have to apologize, but i still feel so sorry. she's not the one who hurt me, it's not fair how she has to put up with it anyway now, kind of? because i know i'm not the only one who is struggling, i know it's hard for people to understand and rationalize it has nothing to do with them personally when i snap and panic. somebody who once accidentally triggered this response in me said “i'll never forget this look in your eyes, you were so scared … of me!”. it's weird. yes i was scared, but not really scared of you. just. scared?

Doc ID: 12525, distribution: 0.5047172702667587 ; [tw: eating disorder] I cried for the entirety of our fifty minute therapy session, crumpled tissues piling high next to me, after she asked me what it was exactly about the eating disorder that I did not want to go back to.  As I described to her in between sobs what is is to survive ten years of violence inflicted upon your own body, something inside of me seemed to break. Remembering the nights of raw throated agony as I kneeled before a toilet bowl to pay my penance for my sins / the days of primal hunger as my stomach burned and my muscles ached, there was a sense of sheer terror that I would ever return to that life of suffering. And yet it pulls at me, the Monster, always calling me backwards towards sickness, towards dying, towards pain. It roars in my head that there is something unclean running through my veins that must be dug out; that I have, merely by existing, perpetrated the greatest of all crimes, transgressed the laws of the gods, and I must spend the rest of my days on my knees repenting. I have spent a lifetime, all of my short twenty-six years on this earth, atoning for sins that I have never even committed.  Are the gods satisfied yet?                                                             ….. “Maybe,” she says slowly, weighing her words, “maybe, you have suffered enough.” I grab another tissue and hug my knees to my chest. It is deeply violent to deprive your body of the necessary calories it needs to survive, to heave and convulse before a toilet bowl altar, to run until your body is on the verge of collapse. What is it to live through trauma that is of your own making? What is it to live through such extreme violence at your own hands?  For so long I have numbed myself to the reality of what I was doing, but I felt the gravity of it all in that moment, telling her about how I used to lay in bed, counting my too-slow heartbeats to make sure I was still alive, all the while praying that I was not. Because, I tell her, to wake up and live another day meant listening to the Monster's orders, being a slave to Its sadistic whims and I couldn't bear that one more day.  I choke down more tears.  Reliving those days, those haunted days, brings up gut-wrenching pain. Yet I have begun to listen to the Monster again lately, buying into Its silver-tongued promises and rose-colored visions of safety and control. I know better, know that the life it offers is a life against my values.  But It's just one snack.  One run. One meal. One day. One week. One life. And I can feel myself falling again, spiraling into the dark place where I cannot choose for myself but can only obey / obey / obey the Monster.  This is not the life that I want. I don't want to go back to living as the dead, to walking around half-girl, half-ghost. I am terrified of being forced into living against myself again, committing violence against my body, directed by my mind.  She tells me that I have a choice in this, that I am giving away my power too easily, and I don't know that I believe her. I want to, but it doesn't feel true.                                                        ….. Just eat your food, Lindsay, I tell myself, eat your damn food.  I am sitting at a restaurant with friends, smiling and laughing and talking as though I were not starving myself to death.  The full plate of food in front of me makes my stomach growl and the hunger pangs grow stronger.  I can hear the therapist's voice in my head, Think about the life that you want. This is not what you want.  But the voice of the Monster is loud and strong, and I feel small and weak in comparison.                                                          ….. “I don't know how to want to eat,” I tell her.  “You won't want to,” she says, “You just have to go through the motions for a while before it gets easier.”  I open the door to the refrigerator, close it, and then open it again.  I do not want to eat. But I am so very tired of pain, always pain. I am so very tired of dying.  I am so very tired of the hellish existence that is my eating disorder. I get out a plate. I make no promises for tomorrow, I tell her. I'm not committing myself to recovery and rainbows and sunshine. I don't know that I am even capable of beating back the Monster for any extended length of time. The Monster's grip on me is tight. But maybe - I hesitate before continuing - maybe just for this one meal, I have suffered enough.

Doc ID: 2505, distribution: 0.4466452913524294 ; If your body was invisible and the world could only see you for your heart and soul, would you live life differently? 👀 

Would you say yes to more invitations?

Would you be able to live in the moment more?

Would you enjoy food more?

Would you believe in yourself more?

Would you be kinder? To yourself and to others?

If I could give my younger self any advice... it would be this: Don't let your body hold you back. There's so much more to life than your weight, clothing size & appearance!! 👑

For so many of us, we've allowed our harsh views of our body and others' opinions of beauty affect how we live our lives, what we wear, how we carry ourselves, what we can eat, how much we can eat, how we feel about ourselves & we fill our minds with doubtful thoughts. We treat our bodies like a work in progress, a “before” photo that doesn't deserve to be seen.

But a day we turn down doing something that brings us joy is a day of happiness we will NEVER get back. So I encourage you to do something this week you've been holding off on… Maybe it's dining out, or going to the beach, rocking a cute dress, or wearing a bright crop top. What is that thing for you? Lmk below… I'll go first!

Whatever it is, you deserve to enjoy it. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to be comfortably & unapologetically you. Today, tomorrow and every day after that.

Idk about you, but to me, real is beautiful.
Softness is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Just leaving these posts here every Monday to break up your feed a lil & remind you not to let your mind bully your body 🌟

Happy Real Me Monday 💛

in my people pleasing past, i learned how to control the reactions of other people so that i could be in their favor by doing what ~i thought~ would make them happy

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others? 

in the most loving way i can say this- people don't care like you think they do. 

do the thing, make the jump, hire the person, make the change 

your best and highest version is waiting for you 😇🦋

Doc ID: 16651, distribution: 0.5246619902900653 ; I had therapy this morning and it felt like a very bland session. It didn't feel worth the session fee (although of course I will still pay it). The session ended and I wondered what we actually achieved. Last week we talked about my childhood, and as we ended, T said “we probably need to spend a bit more time thinking about this”. So I was all willing to talk about it some more this week but it's hard to open it all up again and it feels like we never got back as deep as we were the first time.  I think I wanted her to respond in certain ways to things I said, and when she didn't, I felt dissatisfied and frustrated. I kept working hard but it just wasn't really happening in my brain this week. I couldn't find the words to explain thoughts or feelings, I couldn't gather my thoughts enough to get them into words I wanted to say. I tried to go with what was coming up in my brain, which meant we jumped around a bit. I think it did work to an extent because I did eventually stop thinking about how we weren't connecting and how we weren't really getting into anything properly…. and I suppose when you stop thinking about it that's often because it's started happening. Ahh anyway. I will try and think of some positives of the session in a minute. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12306, distribution: 0.43027058018721653 ; I told a therapist once that I wished I could fix my broken brain and stop all the self-destructive noise, and responding by telling me that my brain is reacting exactly as it should be given my trauma history. I started crying because for so long I had thought that there was something wrong with me. I was always the sick one, the one who couldn't stop self-destructing, the one who was broken. Except I wasn't.  She told me that while it feels incredibly frustrating to deal with panic attacks or dissociation or flashbacks, and it gets incredibly tiring having to tell myself that yes, we are going to eat today, my brain is actually responding in a really healthy manner. It's simply trying to protect me post-trauma. My brain has always been trying to protect me, and that helps somehow on the hard days. It helps to know that despite my brain leaning towards maladaptive ways of survival, it is simply because it doesn't know that we're not in original circumstances anymore when that was needed to disconnect. It is still desperately trying to get me through the hard stuff.   I'm now learning how to orient myself to the present, to send signals to my system that we are safe now, and to teach my brain that it doesn't need to protect me in that same way anymore. But I'm also grateful - although that may sound strange - at how cool it is that my brain is THAT hard-wired to survive. It's kind of beautiful to think about actually, at least in the moments when my head is above water. So here's to not being angry at myself when a symptoms pops up that interferes with my life. Instead, here's to compassion and gratitude at the way my brain is trying to help.  
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12465, distribution: 0.5384387409613887 ; In the past, some of my logic for staying stuck in the eating disorder was, “But what if life doesn't get better afterwards? Like what if I recover / weight restore / stop using X behavior and life is still awful, but I just have no way to cope with it?” And I was surprised how many times in treatment I heard a similar sentiment from my peers. I remember a friend talking about how she was so afraid that the trauma and pain and misery would still be present if she let go of using disordered behaviors that she would rather stay in the misery she knew - a familiar, safe misery.   We had both staying in the hell for fear that there was hell on the other side.  But what if we were wrong? I know, I know, you may not fully buy that, but hear me out: What if?  Hold space for that question for a moment: What if your vision of the future right now is distorted, because the fog of the disorder is so heavy around your mind that you can't see clearly what's ahead of you? What if you recover and let go and it's not more pain? What if you can create a life that you actually want to present in, one in which you don't have to numb out constantly just to survive?  Here's what I'm not saying: life will be pain-free and sparkly-glittery-unicorns every second of every day. Life is complex and filled with all kinds of experiences, but Y'ALL. What if we were wrong about everything? What if there is actually so much goodness ahead of us?  Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't it worth fighting with every ounce of energy we have left in our tired bodies to get to the other side?  It's easier to succumb to the siren song of the disorder, a song of protection from pain and numbness to the trauma we've faced. I'm not asking you to commit to recovery or give up your self-destructive behaviors. I'm asking you to consider, even just for a second: What if you were wrong about hope?

Doc ID: 14454, distribution: 0.5384120055505198 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week's been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I'd been holding all week… and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right?? 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16349, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // ending talk // part two  Then T said “but you brought up last week that you had been thinking about ending therapy….” I haltingly explained my thought processes around that. Mostly thoughts that ending therapy is a necessity at some point and that I want the ending to be well managed and enough time to do it properly, not have it forced upon us by external circumstances. I said that I hadn't intended to say it last week but I felt like after T had brought it up, I felt like I had to say it because if I waited till this week to say it, it would seem like I was just saying it sort of as a defence to what T had said. T said I was making good progress, some big leaps, in therapy and if I wasn't making any progress, she would be suggesting we finish. But I am making progress. I was thinking, are you talking me out of finishing? It felt a bit like that, even though she said “I'm not saying that I think we should finish this year or that we shouldn't finish next year” I do trust that she works very ethically and she has supervision, so I don't think she would talk me into staying as a client if she didn't think it was best for me. I asked “but how do you know when you're ready to end?” T said “Hmm I think you just know” I said “Yes but when we have a foster baby, imagine if there was a family all ready to adopt them and social care said to us, when will you be ready to say goodbye, what date would you like the move to be? I would say never. I'd never be ready. It feels like that with therapy.“ I said “On the other hand, I'm never going to know if I can cope with stuff, the stuff that will inevitably happen, without therapy, until I actually try it.” T agreed with me and talked again about how when we felt like the time was right, we could cut down therapy sessions, first to every fortnight for a while, and then to once a month. So we would have time to see how I coped without therapy in those in between times and get used to managing things myself. T said “Maybe you need to hear that this is about a relationship, for both of us. That we will both grieve it when it's ended. To do long term therapy, it has to become a relationship. We have a meaningful relationship and there will be a time of grieving when it's over.” We had lots of eye contact and I felt our good connection while she was saying this. After she'd said it, we sat quietly for a few moments. “How does it feel in your body right now?” T asked. Ugh I can't answer that. I scanned my body but there was nothing in particular there. I felt sad but it all seemed to be in my head. T said she felt a tightness in her chest and throat, like you might feel when you were sad. Even with her prompting I couldn't answer her question though. Eventually I told her “That's a too-hard question”. We sat quietly again. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9614, distribution: 1.0 ; a note on eating disorders and eating disorder recovery:

eating disorders aren't just about food. eating disorders are not just a result of diet culture. eating disorder recovery isn't simply about eating without restrictions.

eating disorders are MENTAL illnesses that are characterized by eating behavior disturbances and related thoughts and emotions, and to really truly recover, there's often a lot to unpack and a lot of inner work to do.

especially with “recovery influencers” on social media, it can sometimes seem like recovery is simple and that there's a textbook straightforward way to recover. right now, that way is through going “all in”.

if you didn't know, over a year ago, i went “all in” (i have a highlight with some posts about my experiences), but for me, it was primarily to try and gain weight and get more in tune with my body, not to heal my relationship to food (which i did prior). it doesn't really matter to me if you consider me going “all in” a part of my recovery or not because the labels don't really matter, but my point is that most of my progress with healing my relationship to food was not done by simply eating it. for some people, the “all in” method of recovery works, and that's great! but, i think it's important to recognize that it's not the only way, and if you can't go “all in” with your circumstances, your recovery is still valid and worth pursuing. 

i know i've probably said things along the lines of “just choose food freedom!” because i no longer view myself as a “recovery account” and rather someone just promoting self-acceptance, self-care, and living a full life, but if i've ever made any of you who are in recovery feel invalidated, i am truly sorry because i know recovery is not that simple.

to those of you in recovery: I SEE YOU, and i am so proud of you for fighting. healing isn't linear, and even when you feel like you're going backwards or not making progress, i promise that you are still growing. your recovery doesn't have to be “instagrammable” to be worthy- in fact, if it's not “instagrammable”, you're probably doing it right. please keep going. i am rooting for you and hope you remember that every win counts.

Doc ID: 8856, distribution: 0.36525567674758647 ; a little while back i was told that i am a 
👑self-care queen👑

while i appreciated it wholeheartedly, i also felt conflicted. in my head, that statement  implied “self care” is something extravagant and not something for everyone

but self care is an imperative….
it's a non-negotiable to me

when i'm not taking care of myself / prioritizing myself, the care/attention/love i can give to the people around me is less genuine. i'm more resentful and snappy and unhappy with the way my attention is constantly directed away from my own needs

you can't pour from an empty cup, but it also doesn't feel good to be constantly pouring from a half-full cup. fill that cup all the way! fill it up so much that it's constantly overflowing and overflowing everyone else's cups! fill it up so much that there's not a chance the people around you won't feel it and be inspired to continue filling theirs.

self-care isn't just the thing i do on the weekends when i “have time.” it's the thing i do regularly so that i don't feel neglected by myself. it's the thing that allows me to be present and hold space for other people. 

so if that looks like saying “no” to people, say no
if that looks like being on IG less, be on IG less
if that looks like going out for a walk during your lunch, do that
if that looks like having difficult conversations to set your boundaries with others…. do it. that's what i've been doing lately. 

and what's interesting is that when i got that message i was just coming out of a week of stress and sleep deprivation. i was trying to get back on my self-care extra hard because i saw how my attitude was affecting other people. 

we are all entitled to be self care queens/kings❤️ it's not selfish. it's not self-centered. it's not disregard for others. it's simply showing up for you so you an show up for others. 

how do you show up for yourself on a regular basis?  let me know 👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼

Doc ID: 7057, distribution: 0.31484449731099823 ; i'm the healthiest and happiest i've ever been. for the first time in my life, my body is my friend, and i treat it with love and respect.

when i was my lowest weight, i thought i was the healthiest. when i was eating the least amount and the most restrictive, i thought i was the healthiest. but this wasn't health. these were results of me bending over backwards to fit diet culture's definition of health. i ignored my own personal definition of health because for years, diet culture convinced me health was objective- that for every person health meant eating x and working out y amount and on and on and on.

my body has changed a lot this past year. i could spend hours retracing my steps, trying to figure out and pinpoint every little change that could have resulted in weight gain and a new body. but fixation isn't healthy. fearing weight gain isn't healthy.

you know what is healthy? eating foods i love, when my body asks for them. saying yes, even if it means sacrificing control over a situation. showing up in relationships when it's safer to isolate. 

healthy is listening to my body and honoring its needs. i'm still learning to recognize myself in this new body and some days it's challenging. i feel like sometimes weight gain happens right under our noses, unintentional, and suddenly one day we notice it and feel blindsided. i get it. when old thoughts kick in, i remember: 

⚡️this is the body that allows me to live a full and happy life. 

i think of every aspect of my life that has improved in the past year, all of the hard yet rewarding changes i've made, and i can't help but smile. we need to change the societal narrative- we need to value how we feel over how we look. we need to remember health is deep.

⚡️my health isn't seen, but felt. 

how my body looks will never be worth more than the happiness i feel within it, each and every day. 

by the way… you can find more body positive and healing oriented conversations like this one in my book 👀📚💕 lots of journaling and writing prompts too! link to pre order in my bio 🥳

if you want to add more to your “unstoppable” toolkit,

add some purpose into the mix.

even with the holidays being bright and jolly, loving friends and family around, and my wedding to the love of my life coming up, it's been kinda rough

im in my luteal phase (ladies you know what it's like), things have been slow on the business side, & some friendships have been coming to a close

i wanted to throw in the towel and disappear quite a few times already this month. just being real.

but… i remembered my WHY. that this life that i'm living is bigger than me. 

and that i owe it to you, and i owe it to myself, to keep moving forward with love

i've learned and am always practicing how to hold and feel my emotions and still say “yes, i feel it all AND i am here to bring my community more light.”

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

She said over the years some of the things I have disclosed about my childhood have made her really angry, but she hasn't said it at the time as she needed me to come to my own conclusions. Which she thinks I have now.  “I want to say to them, how dare you make mealtimes like that?! All about recriminations and sadness! Mealtimes are meant to be happy times, everyone coming together, and instead you make Faith cry! Your dad being angry like that…. your parents not dealing with their own emotions.” She said lots more on the subject but I can't remember all of it word for word. She was showing me she was on my side and I did feel it when she said all that. In my mind, I could feel her stepping up next to my child-self and defending me.  I know that it's important for her stay neutral and not put ideas in my head or whatever, but I'm not brave enough to validate my own childhood feelings because I have this loud critical voice that tells me I'm just making a fuss and to shut up and get on with things. So I really really do need to hear it from T. At the end of the session, T asked me how it felt now we had talked about that. And I said that it felt better, that I felt a bit more like she was on my side, because when it feels like she's defending my parents or justifying their actions about me moving up, then I feel like I'm alone and I'm making a fuss about nothing. “Oh… you're definitely not doing that” T said. I nodded while looking down, and she repeated again in a softer voice, “You're definitely not doing that”. I felt very soothed by the way she said that and in my imagination I felt like T had put an arm round me and reassured me, like an adult might to a child. The session seemed to come into land quite gently this week. We didn't do any grounding or small talk at the end, just scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

Doc ID: 15566, distribution: 0.5114836989606323 ; Moving forwards in therapy  Therapy yesterday was really good. I've had a run of good sessions recently, no ruptures for ages. I wonder if it's because I've built so much trust in T now that I can tell her in session, when it happens, if something isn't right or isn't helpful, and we can alter course immediately to get back on track.  I'm able to talk more fluently in session and although we still have pauses, they're mostly not caused by my brain shutting down, they're more constructive thinking pauses. It's taken years of work to get to this point (I'm sure other therapy clients get there faster… I feel like I've been very slow, although I can also have compassion for myself and understand why that is, so I'm not blaming myself. It is what it is). I think we're doing good work together at the moment. I feel like I'm moving through stuff. Some years ago, T likened our position in therapy at that time to being on a rollercoaster, but just sitting at the top of the track, moving back and forth…. not rolling backwards but not moving forwards either. At the time, she said it's like we're sitting up there, just waiting… waiting…. to set off forwards again.  I think I felt a bit unhappy with her analogy when she said it because it felt like she was saying we were stuck, and I didn't feel like I was stuck. There was lots going on in my head, rearranging of thoughts, processing stuff, but it was probably stuff she didn't see because I was still struggling to share everything I was thinking. Eventually I can't remember exactly what happened, but there was a session where all my internal building of momentum finally reached a tipping point and we started to move forward again. I think soon after that, T said we were “hurtling along”.  I imagine that's quite normal in therapy, periods of not much progress seeming to happen, and then periods of really fast growth. It's not always an exact steady process. I feel like I'm in a time of fast growth again at the moment. Lots of little insights. Learning things in particular situations that I think I will be able to apply to broader situations in the future. Accepting my attachment to T and my feelings towards her as being ok and healthy and necessary to enable me to do the work I need to do. Learning to ask for and accept things from her.  It all feels good. We haven't spoken again about her retiring, so I think that means the date is still over a year away. I'm glad about that.

I posted about studying on my story, It was on my mind ALL month. “catch up, catch up, catch up” I said to myself. “you can do it, you can do it, you can do it". but time slips away while juggling lots of things and this week I felt like I had nothing to show for the effor I was trying to put in. I know the Aquarians can relate lol

I wanted to give myself a chance to try all the things. and I did. in a post earlier, I said “I know that at any time I can withdraw from any activity if I feel it is doing me worse than what I intended. I know that I can always come back to my breath during my highest times of anxiety and stress.” and I really stuck to that! manifestation! daily practice! thank God for yoga

under all this pressure I chose myself over my ambition. self love isn't pushing yourself to do your best all the time. it's nurturing that child within and making that gentle, warm space where you can bloom. it's reaching out for help to show yourself you're not, in fact, alone. it's standing down when you realize you are out matched in the battlefield you created

i'm super grateful for all the lattes and support i've gotten, prepped meals and snacks like the delicious (I forgot how much I love quinoa!!!!), and for all of these events In my life that make me want to grow

thank you for your warm energy and bringing my thoughts to life in your world

.
it simply happened when i was ready.
.
eating disorders, like all  traumas, are deeply intimate. when i was sick i went to humiliating lengths to obey an illness. i was irrational, irritable, rude. for years i was embarrassed of who i once was and the struggle that shaped me. i wanted to bury my past and move on.
.
but with time comes acceptance. as i forged deeper into recovery, i found a new love for life that starkly contrasted the darkness of years past. my life grew brighter. i realized how powerful this transition was and i itched to share it. .
it felt selfish to hold this in, keep my story a secret when i could help someone find their way out. .
.
so i spoke up.
.
i knew i was ready because the heart with which i viewed my ED with underwent a shift. instead of understanding my disorder as a humiliating character flaw, i saw it for what it truly was: a tragedy out of my control and nothing more. not a choice, not my identity.
.
with acceptance i found a voice. i could easily use before/after photos to tell my story, but words are more powerful. i can use them to deeply convey  the pain and fear, the strength and resilience, every inch of the process from hurt to healed. my story is more than a physical manifestation.
.
if you have a story and want to share it:
*reach a place of stability before opening up. you may be too fragile right now. that's okay. don't rush.
*dismiss the idea that your story isn't “good enough”. that you weren't “sick enough” or didn't endure “enough”. *know that being vulnerable makes you stronger. courage isn't crafted in a place of comfort.
.
one thing i will say is that you can't let fear of judgement hold you back. there is not a rational soul out there that will blame YOU for your struggle. i used to be ashamed of my past. now? thousands of strangers know that i used to smash bowls of oatmeal on the floor to avoid eating. im not embarrassed by the pain i went through. i'm empowered by my ability to rise above it.
.
if you're ready, tell me...what's your story?

I know you wrote about this before but my last session some very obvious abusive things my mom did came up and Idk how to go about talking about it especially without dissociating by time the session ends. It's so vulnerable to talk about and explore and the feelings are so conflicting and I just don't want to talk about it but I know I have to. I'd also really like to not shut down  Answer: We've approached the subject very slowly over weeks and weeks, just hinting at it or saying one or two little things, so that gradually I've been able to stay present with it. I think you have to be able to trust your therapist that they won't push you too far each session (while also being able to push you just enough at times).We've also taken the last - minutes of the session to “unwind” (that's what T calls it) but basically to ground and get back to the present, which has worked really well for me. Remember that you don't have to talk about it all at once in one go. You can just talk about one small part of it, dip in and then move on to talk about something else. For me it's felt really important to feel like T is on my side with this, before I've been able to be fully vulnerable with how I felt about my mum. So that's been gradually building up over recent session as well, me saying things and watching for her response, I'm quite hypervigilant anyway to how others are responding to me.I hope you find a way to talk about it with your therapist when you're ready!

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.42843153541995893 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

T has done some adoption counselling in the past and so she knows what she's talking about.  We moved on to talking about food. I'd sent T a text the day before, saying I was worried about telling her my weight because it wasn't good. And then a lot of waffle about why it might have dropped so much. Then, in an effort to show I was trying to take some responsibility for it, I sent another text with a picture of my lunch (which always looks like a HUGE bowl of food) and said that I had eaten three scrambled eggs for breakfast because I was not feeling well at all and knew I needed more. T got far too excited by the three scrambled eggs. She said how great it was that I recognised I was feeling unwell and ate more as a result. Ugh, I didn't think it was that big a deal. I have eaten three eggs for breakfast on a few previous occasions.  I sat there facing a resolutely happy T telling me how well I'm doing, while I'm just thinking about how terribly I'm doing. I want her to ask what my weight is, because I'm not trying to hide it from her. I just felt that if I texted it straight out to her, it would be open to misinterpretation as to how I felt about it. Why isn't she asking? We aren't following our usual session pattern here… I don't like it. “In the past, even a little bit last session, you have needed me to be the adult, because adult-Faith hasn't been able to take charge and look after child-Faith. But here I can see your adult getting on board and making some healthy decisions. You are recognising things aren't great and doing something about it…. maybe not doing enough about it, but it's a start.” I looked very doubtfully at her. I don't get it. I lost a load of weight but managed to eat an extra egg and this is somehow a good thing? We spent abot  minutes of the session stop-starting this conversation, sitting in silence, and then not really arguing but not really connecting either. T trying to avoid diving into the food conversation and me trying to get her to dive in there anyway. Eventually she looked at me and said “Do you want to carry on talking about this? We can talk about something else, or do you want to push through with this?” It felt like she didn't want to carry on talking about it. But I didn't have anything else particular to talk about and I didn't feel like we'd really talked about what we needed to yet. I felt like T had just tiptoed round the edge of it.

Doc ID: 2650, distribution: 1.0 ; HAPPY REAL ME MONDAY! 🥰 Ok, grab a cuppa tea & get comfy because I'm about to get deep… As most of you know, I've struggled with low self-esteem & a negative relationship with my body image for the first  years of my life. I always compared myself to these “perfect” Instagram models and celebrities online, I wanted to be slimmer, get rid of my cellulite, have a toned flat tummy / & I always felt guilty for eating. 

I ended up losing kgs in , but even at the end of my weight loss journey, I still picked at my “flaws” and wasn't happy. I still got bloated, had cellulite, rolls, a layer of fat around my tummy, my legs still wobbled when I walked, I STILL DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE WOMEN I ASPIRED TO LOOK LIKE. 

The only time I looked somewhat similar to them was when I was tensing hard, sucking in, before I'd eaten and when I posed in unnatural ways. That's when I realised that the photos I was seeing online were posed and “perfected” too. The women I aspired to look like only showed me % of themselves, the perfected % and it was unfair of me to compare the version of my body that I see every day, to the unrealistic version of someone else. And that's when I started to really focus on rewiring my mindset around my body image. I spent all of  practising self love and accepting my body without a need to lose weight, gain muscle, etc.. Just simply enjoy being in my skin without wanting to change it. And then  weeks ago, I started posting the REAL version of me publicly for you guys to see as well, because I'd much prefer to showcase my body's normalities than portray perfection any day! 

It's honestly been one of the best things I've done…  weeks ago I was so terrified to post the first Real Me Monday and today as I click “Share” I feel nothing but pride. I am who I am, and I like that person. All I hope for with these posts is that it may inspire you to do the same. I love you guys and I'm so grateful you've accepted me for me 💛

(It was a very relevant suggestion given what we were talking about.) I said no. I nearly said yes because my instinct was to be polite and say yes of course I want to hear your story. In the past, I might also have said yes because T talking takes the pressure off me having to talk, and sometimes that need felt important enough to override whether or not I wanted to hear what she said. Anyway, I thought about saying yes, but then I realised that I didn't really want to hear her story so I shook my head, no. If she complained to the hospital, that likely involves her being in a position of vulnerability beforehand, and as much as T might want to tell me that story to do a bit of the whole “don't put me on a pedestal” thing, I can't deal with it. I don't want to know about any of that side of her life as a human being. I just want her to be strong and grown up and perfect. I know she's not, because obviously she's human, but for me I just want to keep thinking of her that way.  I cannot bear to think of my mum being hurt or upset. As a child it used to feel absolutely unbearable and world-ending when I saw my mum upset, and I still can't deal with it even now, even with (supposedly) the benefit of an adult viewpoint. Maybe I don't actually have an adult viewpoint because whenever it happens, I'm just triggered back into those childhood feelings and responses. Anyway, the whole maternal transference to my therapist is strong, we both know that, and so I feel the same way about T as I did (and do) about my mum. I don't know if it needs to be worked through eventually - but I'm pretty resistant to the idea.

Doc ID: 2427, distribution: 1.0 ; My personality really went from 👹 THEN to 🥰 NOW… Anyone else feel like they don't even know the person they used to be anymore? HAHA the growth game is strong.

Q for you: do you feel like you take aligned action towards the things that matter to you, the life you dream of & the person you want to be? Answer honestly with a 🙋🏻‍♀️ or 🙅🏻‍♀️ below!

In all honesty, I used to be a pretty negative person. I tried so hard to fit in. I fed habits that didn't serve me AT ALL. I was reactive. I wasn't myself. I played small. I doubted myself. I tried to grow up so quickly. Had a negative relationship with food & my body. Put myself down. Gave into peer pressure. Spent time with people who didn't bring out the best in me. Compared myself constantly. Got mad all the time, and felt bad all the time.

But that's all part of learning about yourself, right? You learn from your mistakes, you get a sense of what does & doesn't feel like 'you'. You start setting boundaries, attracting YOUR people, knowing your worth, doing more of what makes you feel good & start living your life on YOUR terms. You also usually outgrow really bad haircuts HAHA.

If you're not where you want to be right now, just remember that you're in the perfect position for growth. You're learning every day. And you're always evolving, so you don't have to have it all figured out right now. I feel worlds apart from the person I was even just a few years ago, and I'm sure I'll say the same thing a few years from now about my current self. But at the end of the day, I'm so grateful for every version of me, because I wouldn't be the person I am today without HER 🫶

I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 9170, distribution: 1.0 ; What's it like being a vegan clinical dietitian in a hospital? .

I've been getting this question so much since I started working, and a lot of variations of it.  I didn't think i'd love it as much as I do but i'm enjoying it so much!! I see it all as a learning experience because I want to go into preventative care in the future, but I think learning about the acute conditions that affect SO MANY (think-  million americans) and how they are treated in the hospital is important for me to know what to do when they come out

I love the patient contact, I love learning about different diagnoses and how we treat them (in the ACUTE setting). when appropriate, I tell people to eat as many plants as possible and try going for plant based protein options when out of the hospital, but unfortunately the patients are in no way in a place that is appropriate for vegan diet education—unless they request it or unless it's some special event

my main job is to make sure they are getting in some kind of nutrition so that they can make it out healthy and alive. I see this as a stepping stone. once they make it out, they now have the opportunity to turn their lives around but they obviously can't do that in a hospital bed

it breaks my heart to see people who suffer from illnesses that they probably wouldn't have if they grew up in a community like this—health, science, and wellness conscious—so that is what drives me to keep going

I barely ever say “eat meat” or “eat dairy” to patients, by the way,  cause that conversation rarely comes up. it's usually “are you having trouble eating? when was your last bowel movement? do you have any allergies? are you finishing your meals?” etc. very rudimentary, basic level nutrition type stuff. the “varsity” (as I like to call it) nutrition comes in during outpatient counseling!
.

I hope this gave you a good look on my thoughts of clinical nutrition. if you have any more questions, i'll make more posts about it so comment away!! .

I had such an amazing time hiking with the @vedgenutrition athletic club this past saturday at the Los Leones Trail 🥾

We got to chat with new & familiar like minded humans & everyone sat for a good  minutes just breathing in the sunshine and stillness at the top of the hill.

Doc ID: 2354, distribution: 0.4600686030607546 ; Unpopular opinion: beauty standards are overrated… There's more to life than trying to be “pretty”, “toned”, “body goals”, “that girl” or liked by others. Instead, what I want to be is KIND to myself & others, CONFIDENT in my skin & abilities, and unapologetically ME; my soft, messy, imperfect, true self.

So after years of putting myself down, struggling with body image & seeking validation from others, I choose to tell myself I am already good enough… & I carry out my every day life as if that is so. 

I've started showing up as the realest version of myself (right) & not the Instagram-version (left) that I've always felt I had to be, I began romanticising my daily tasks, being my own cheerleader, opting out of comparison, wearing the clothes I never believed I could wear, moving my body for nourishment instead of punishment & saying yes to invitations & things I never would've before.

Beauty doesn't have anything to do with the way the world perceives you. Confidence doesn't come from their opinion of you. Let them think what they think. What matters is what YOU see. Your body is your home. You can decorate it however you like, and if you think it's beautiful, that's all that matters. But at the end of the day, it's the stuff on the inside that counts & shines through.

“Self love” isn't linear, some days we'll feel bleh & other days great, but being a little more mindful of the messages you consume & the way you speak to yourself everyday goes a long way.

That's what this weekly series is for. To remind you not to compare your life or your body to someone on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with yourself as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that. Feel free to revisit my posts whenever you need them & I highly encourage you to follow more creators who will make your online world feel like a safer, happier place to be! 🌎 

Happy Real Me Monday ☀️🥹💗

Doc ID: 12529, distribution: 0.4014452589851876 ; [tw: ED, addiction]  She calls me in tears, telling me she's started using again and can't stop, and all I want in that moment is to save her. I want to fly across the country, throw out all the drugs and make her promise me to stay clean.

But I know better.

I know it doesn't work that way.

“Am I going to live in this cycle forever?” she asks me, “Using and then going to treatment only to relapse again once I leave?”

As I lay curled up on my couch after the call ends, I want to pretend like my struggles are gone and that I am somehow beyond where she is. I want to tell myself I am not in the exact same place, wanting desperately to go back to my demons and be pulled back into a vicious cycle of sickness.

                                                                       ….. Sitting in dark, empty apartment, I pull my blanket around my shoulders and wait for the overcast Sunday skies to break into rain.

I've been flirting with death again lately, letting myself slip here and there, justifying it all by saying it's just one time, what does it really matter?

I know where this path leads, know that this ends in shivering cold misery and obsessive weight loss, that it ends in hospitals and feeding tubes and months and months of trying to undo the damage. Maybe that's the point, though. Maybe that's what I am subconsciously working towards.  Because I miss it, in some twisted way; I miss being sick.  I miss living in a mental fog, not being able to think straight or concentrate on anything. I miss lacking energy, feeling faint, feeling like I was on a high when I didn't eat for days. And most of all, I miss dying.

On the spectrum of life and death, I have hovered on the side of death for the past ten years. There was something comforting in not having to face the world, in hiding behind sickness and death. Not having to deal with pain and past trauma, not having to feel, not having to know what it is to be human; the eating disorder was a safe haven, a protection from a terrifying world.

When I existed in a too-small, fragile body, it felt as if there wasn't room in my body for the pain. As though the less mass I took up on the planet, the less space there was for the hurt. As though I could starve myself small enough to not feel, starve myself small enough to rid myself of my trauma.                                                                    …..

Despite all of the hard work I've done over the past few months, all of the intensive therapy and self-reflection, the pull is strong to go back to what was killing me. The siren song of the disorder is lulling me towards the water's edge, calling me deeper and deeper in, lulling me towards drowning.

“There are so many good things in your life,” the woman tells me, “you have so many opportunities that are life-giving. You have to be healthy for those to happen. You can't have both sickness and your dreams.”

She is right that I cannot have those things without being healthy, but being healthy is strange and disorienting. Being closer to the side of Life is uncharted territory and I'm not sure that I like it. I long for the familiarity of a dying body. I don't know how to live in this new place, a place where I use my words to be heard rather than my physical self.

I am so afraid of being okay, of not being in crisis, of stability and health.

I am so afraid of having the power in my own life.

                                                                 ….. “You spend all your time escaping and avoiding,” says the therapist, “and you're never really present in your own life.”  I started to run back to the eating disorder a few days ago, deciding to relapse and let myself lose control to the Monster again. I would have kept going for as long as I could hold out when a friend reached out to me and asked to talk. In that moment, I had a choice to make: to show up for my friendships, to be fully present and have deep, meaningful conversations with people I care about, or lose myself in the haze of starvation, becoming a ghost of a woman again, never really there. I chose, this time, to be present.  There is something to that, I think. The most powerful moments in my recovery process have been when people have been fully present with me in my experiences of suffering and pain, walking alongside of me through the darkness. There is something there, something important about the idea that presence brings healing. But for myself, I have avoided presence like the plague, running from anything that makes me feel my emotions, and when pushed to an uncomfortable place, dissociating to protect myself. The eating disorder, in it's desperate attempts to avoid the present moment, has caused me to become so disconnected from my own self, from my body and my own internal experiences.  But what I want - meaningful connections with other people - requires me to show up. It asks of me what I am most afraid of doing: experiencing the range of human emotions in all of its messy glory. It asks me to stop running, always running, from pain.  This healing isn't one sided though: I am healed through the presence of others as much as through my own home-coming to my body and emotions. It is in this dual relationship of fully embodied presence that I am beginning to mend, bit by bit.  I don't know if I'll ever stop missing the sickness fully, or ever really get over the desire to go back to it. But I believe deeply in the power of presence. Not as a magic cure, but as something to hold onto in the midst of the storm.

I said I had some stuff written down. We both started to talk at the same time and she stopped herself and said “I'll let you go where you were going.” I said “Last week's session… it was difficult to speak because I still find it hard to believe myself, and there's a big part of me that still thinks that really you think I'm just making a fuss about nothing and I'm being overdramatic…. it's hard to believe myself and that's why I want to hear it from you, about my childhood, because I think I might believe it more if you tell me it.” T recapped some of the things we have talked about about my childhood, and that she doesn't think I'm being overdramatic. She said my dads anger must have been very frightening, especially think about the size of an adult compared to a child, add in anger, she said no wonder it felt frightening. She said that she knows my dad still makes me cry now in my forties, and that is evidence for me, how my body reacts even now as an adult, its evidence that it was very frightened as a child. I said “I actually don't know how I survived it as a child. Like now, I can just about cope with the anxiety of a few days with my parents. But as a child I had nowhere to go, I don't know how I coped.” T said “You coped in the only way you had an option to, which was to shut it all off, all the feelings. Separate them from yourself. Now you have let your feelings back in and become aware of them and that's why you find it so much more difficult being around your dad now.”

I know about how your therapy journey started but do you have any advice for anyone starting therapy? After years & years of wondering, I'm now starting therapy next week. I don't have an ED and I kind of feel like I don't "need" therapy but I also don't really know how to feel happy & can't remember the last time I did. But I don't know whether a therapist could help with that. Answer: Ah I think a therapist could definitely help with that! Well done you for being brave and taking the plunge to work on something that you want to be different in your life. I would have also said I didn't “need” therapy when I started. Because I was keeping myself alive day to day and wasn't that what really counted? But you don't need to be on the verge of insanity before you can go to therapy. Wanting to improve your life in any way related to your mental wellbeing is a good enough reason to go to therapy.I am never sure how helpful it is to give advice about starting therapy, because I think every therapist is slightly different and going in with too much advice given beforehand means you already have expectations about how it should go. I don't know what sort of person you are, whether you find it easy to speak about how you're feeling or not. I also have a whole load of words now to describe my inner world that I didn't have any concept for when I started therapy, so I could suggest from my 'enlightened position' that you say this or that, and you might look at me like I'm talking a foreign language. I think just turn up and try and be as straight up as you can. Tell the therapist why you've come for therapy, and let them take it from there. For me, because I'm quite avoidant and reticent in therapy, sometimes I try and pretend that I'm someone who doesn't mind talking about these things, who doesn't get tied in knots over it. Because I truly believe there are people out there who are like that. So I try and pretend I'm one of them and that can help me just get on and say stuff without overthinking it to the nth degree. A bit like, Fake it till you Make it, although I'm not encouraging you to be fake in therapy, it's just brain tricks I try and use to help myself talk! Best wishes for your first therapy session, I hope it goes well and you click with your therapist. (Remember you can shop around for a different therapist if you find after a few sessions that they're not the one for you) xx

you may be experiencing a gap between what your soul loves and what you are actually doing.

maybe… you've known this for a while but just haven't done anything.

if so, here's a sign for you to start doing just one thing that feels more like YOU. go on that bike ride, go read that book, go do that meditation for a week in the morning and see how you feel!

life is too short to not live it the way you want, but it's long enough for you to experiment and transition slowly❤️

Doc ID: 7563, distribution: 1.0 ; when i was dying from an eating disorder, i wasn't.
.
.
well, that's what i would have told you.
.
.
not all eating disorders are the same, but mine looked like fragility. weakness. paper-thin skin and a skeletal frame. addictive behaviors and irrational fears and a voice in my head that all danced in harmony, looking to slowly and painfully kill me.
.
.
my mom would sneak into my room as i slept. she'd hover over my chest and watch desperately for a rise and fall. was she still breathing? in the mornings i'd wake up and get out of bed in slow motion, seeing stars as my feet hit the ground. .
.
and yet, if you asked me, i wasn't sick. i was healthier than everyone around me.
.
.
this is denial. this is an eating disorder. a world that is warped and twisted. a world where you simply can't be a failure, you've worked much too hard. you are not sick. everyone is out to get you, right? .
.
but denial comes at all stages, not just at times when there are physical manifestations of a problem.
.
.
eventually i went to treatment and gained back all of the weight i lost and more. i returned home to begin transitioning to normal life in the real world.
.
.
mentally, i relapsed. NOW i was the sickest i'd ever been, but how? i looked fine from the outside. healthy, even! this made my denial of an illness even stronger. how can i still be sick when look, there's padding on my middle and my collarbones are tucked away! .
.
eating disorders are marked by denial. a refusal to believe that a pursuit which began with good, “healthy”, intentions could go so…wrong. i didn't truly begin to recover until i accepted that i was hurting, that i had a long road of work ahead of me. regardless of your external state, if there is pain, fear, anxiety, distortion living inside of you…you deserve help. .
.
and you shouldn't deny yourself of that.

Doc ID: 16080, distribution: 0.4796744206765807 ; Texting my therapist debate  A dilemma that rears its head when I'm in a bit of minor crisis is whether to text my therapist. I have two opposing arguments in my head: . Sooner or later, I will end therapy and then I won't have T available to help emotionally regulate me when I need it, so I should learn to get through it on my own without needing to message T  . Sooner or later, I will end therapy and then I won't have T available to help emotionally regulate me when I need it, so I should make use of her availability as long as I have her in order to take in as much as I can from her. Then when I no longer have her, I will have a good stash of internalised “words from T” to help me through. On Wednesday after I'd got back from my traumatic hospital visit with d and her poorly ears, I was a right mess. On the adrenaline comedown from standing my ground against the doctors. I don't do confrontation so it costs me a lot emotionally. I was sitting on the kitchen floor crying with the overwhelm of it all, and just wanting some soothing reassuring words from T, but having the above debate back and forth in my head. Eventually I messaged T “Can I text you about something or should I try and be ok on my own” T replied “I know you only text when you feel you can't work it out on your own, so maybe text me but add what you think my answer might be. Would that work?” It sounded a good plan in theory but in reality I then sent her a long text which made sense to me but probably wasn't hugely clear to her, and I was in a bit much of a state to think what she would say in reply. She replied anyway and said well done and that I had built some more positive neural pathways in being able to stand my ground. Just having that bit of communication with her helped. I might talk next session about the debate I have within myself about texting her though. Find out what is the right thing to do.

Jumping on this trend because I resonated so much with it & thought maybe y'all would too…

Body image is a person's thoughts, feelings & perception of the aesthetics or attractiveness of their body. It's not *actually* about your body, it's about the way you speak to & think of yourself. 

At my lowest weight I still wasn't happy… Look at that face 🥺 I was so focused on looking as lean as possible at all costs that I'd completely overlooked what that state of leanness had actually cost me… I'd forgotten how important LIVING MY LIFE was. I had bad body image days more often than good ones because I was always striving to be “more this” and “less that”. 

Those extra few kilos I've gained in the photo on the right is the freedom to snack out on sleepovers with my besties, to order what I want from the menu, to not weigh and track everything I eat, to not push myself to extremes in a workout, to enjoy my life to the fullest! It's the freedom to accept my body changing & see myself as a whole person, instead of one body part or flaw.

🚨 Disclaimer: this isn't supposed to be a comparison of my body type but rather my mindset now compared to then. It's just that the left photo was taken at a time when I was hard on myself & couldn't find peace with my body. My body image is much better now, not because of my body, but because I'm nourishing my mind with more forgiving, accepting, positive thoughts 🌱🚨

Which do you experience more often? Leave a “🥰” in the comments if you experience more positive body image days & a “😅” if you experience more negative body image days. I'll be replying with some personalised affirmations for y'all because YOU ARE AMAZING!!! Chat with you in the comments 🌈

Doc ID: 15094, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // processing // part one  I told T it had been a difficult week, and then I wailed a bit about the Covid situation and my weekend anxiety spiral and how I'm still feeling fragile. I told her about doing the covid swabs and how the gagging part is kind of triggering but not in the sense that it makes me tempted to start purging, just that it brings back physical memories. T said she was glad that it wasn't making me have increased urges to purge. After I'd got all that out of the way, T said “So with all that going on, have you had any time to think about what we talked about last week?”  I fidgeted a bit and stared away and said “Mmm yes, I have thought about it. Uh, yeah….. uh… it felt good, when you said what you would have liked to have said to my parents. That felt like you were on my side, and it's easier for me to believe my feelings when it feels like you are on my side rather than when you're staying neutral.”  T nodded. I feel like I'm spoon feeding her this a bit - “I need you on my side for this”. I don't seem to able to validate my own childhood feelings myself. Probably because I'm still worried about my feelings being “wrong”, which I know comes from childhood where I learnt that mostly my own feelings *were* wrong and what was right was working out what other people's feelings were. Whatever those were, they were the “right” feelings about the situation. “Um, and then when I was talking about that protocol that I found, for moving into different school years, and you said that it wouldn't have been around  years ago… well then I felt like you were making excuses for them again…” T looked a bit thoughtful and said “Mmm yes… I can see that… “ “I mean, maybe it wasn't around then, but presumably they wrote it at some point because there was a need for it. To stop children being moved around years in an unmanaged way…. At the end of it, it says that all these people should agree the move - the parents, the headteachers of the school, the educational psychology service… it just seems….” I drifted off into silence, staring into space. “It just seems…” T prompted “Um, it just seems, that there were all these adults involved in making the decision…. like there was me, over here, a child…. and all these adults over there making a decision together and any one of them could have decided that it wasn't a good idea - but none of them did…”  (A note to my therapy notes, I'm not talking about this to cast blame or assign responsibility. It's really more about processing all the feelings around it, all the thoughts that come up. I'm not trying to reach any particular position at the end of it, I just want to explore my feelings and say some of the things that I've never had a chance to say.) I carried on to say to T that I could have said no, to moving up the second year. My parents did ask me how I felt about it so I did have a chance to say no, and if I'd said no, I'm pretty certain it wouldn't have happened. However I can't really blame myself on that front, it's not surprising that I didn't say no. I'd received messages all my childhood up till then that being bright and high achieving and doing everything younger than everyone else was a good thing and made adults pleased with me and made me special, so why wouldn't I have wanted to continue that?

It's from “The Attachment Theory Workbook” by Annie Chen. I don't own the book, I was just browsing through it on amazon. When I read this paragraph, it really resonated with me. T read it and set off talking about it head-on at mph, and then seemed to realise what she was doing and pulled herself back a bit and gave me space instead to talk about how it resonated with me. I think this was a moment when her head wasn't fully in the game to start with. I talked about how H comes at me affectionately and it makes me pull away because I am not a touchy-feely person. But then the more I pull away, the more I feels he comes at me and his need for physical touch or closeness overwhelms me. T said maybe his love language is physical touch, and I said yes I think it is. I feel bad for not liking it, and then I feel bad for not being that person who does like it. I feel like H deserves someone nicer than me. H's brother and his wife are very touchy-feely with each other, and I think that's how H would like us to be and I just can't. T talked about how she would work if she was doing couples therapy with us. What she said wasn't really news. I know the theory of how couples therapy in that context works. T said she really only has a hazy view of H, and that's because of my avoidant nature impacting how I talk about him. T asked me if had spoken to H about any of this, and I said no not really. I said we used to talk a lot, before we got married, and we did talk about emotional stuff. But then we had babies and then my eating disorder got really bad and I was very shut down. And now I'm doing well in recovery from that but it's hard to find my way back to connecting with H again. I told her about how we went for a meal a couple of weekends ago and I did tell H quite a lot of the recent stuff we've talked about in therapy, and he surprised me by how well he dealt with it. T talked about how we have built up my trust in her and my relationship so that I can talk with her about all this stuff. I said yes but I don't have that trust with H, I don't trust that he will know how to respond. And then I can't think how I would carry the conversation, and then it all feels too hard.  “I'm going to set you some homework this week, Faith. I want you to find a time to talk with H about some of this, even if you just go for a walk around the block. Maybe you could tell him some of the process, even before you get onto the content. I mean like, tell him that you get uncomfortable talking about this, or that you worry he won't know what to say.” I looked very unconvinced at her. I told her how it all felt hard work, and I wasn't sure I wanted it. I think I said it was too much hard work several times through the session. I want it, but at the same time I know it's hard and uncomfortable to push myself to get to it, and so sometimes I feel like I will just stick with how things are. Towards the end of the session, T said “I've changed my mind on the homework. We'll leave talking to H for now. Instead I want you to think about how you would like it to be different between you and H.” I agreed to that (although I haven't really done it yet).

Doc ID: 14969, distribution: 0.45317920558243124 ; Question: Hi Faith,I sent an anon the other day about not wanting to be around job sounds like it is quite triggering for you with regard to your own past trauma. I definitely believe that it is *possible* to move past this so don't lose hope. I think when we fully process our past traumas with a therapist who really understands us, the trauma loses some of its hold over us. It is still there and it has still shaped who we are today but we don't react from that traumatised child place anymore, instead it is filed along with other memories.However that work can be quite deep and painful and not everyone feels ready or chooses to do it. In which case as you suggest, a practical approach would be finding how you can function to your best in the life you want to live. Therapy can be about learning coping strategies and practical skills to stay focused on the future. That's just as valid a use for therapy as talking about the past, and could be a short term way to feel more stable and functional. I know there's lots of people who don't want to go digging around in their past and would rather focus on moving forward and that's absolutely valid. Sometimes therapy can open up too much at a time when you're not in a position to want that or have the space in life to deal with that. So I think the key thing is it's your choice about what to do with therapy. But it would be a great topic to talk with your therapist about and see what they say.From my personal experience of therapy, at the start it was all about building a trusting relationship with my therapist and at the same time a lot of practical management of eating disorder behaviours. Occasional dips into the past but that often destabilised my eating early on, so it's only more recently we've been able to properly look at the past. It's like we've been circling round it gradually getting closer and closer on each pass. It's taken a long time but I can see so much progress in myself that I'm actually excited for the me that is going to emerge at the end of it. Maybe no one else except me and my therapist will know what a journey it's been but that's enough for me.Wishing you all the best in whatever way you move forward anon xx

It would be so easy to portray the image on the left as my everyday self & hide all of the features we've been taught to hate.

I personally spent years yo-yo dieting, self-loathing & following unhealthy fad d!ets because of the pressure I felt to look a certain way, but none of it ever worked or stuck.

And as I learned how to create a more balanced & healthy approach to my lifestyle & habits, I realised I never saw anyone who appeared to live a “fit & healthy lifestyle” still have belly fat, wobbly legs & arms, loose skin, stretch marks, back acne & so many other things I've seen on myself. 

I thought something was wrong with me.

This is why I'm here now, to show you that:
🧘🏻‍♀️ a healthy, balanced lifestyle shouldn't be restrictive or miserable
🥰 having very normal human features - like wobbly, jiggly, dimply bits - isn't something you need to “fix” or hate… it's simply part of being human, all bodies are different!
⚡️ food & body fat isn't your enemy, it's ENERGY
🥹 you are already good enough
💪 our bodies will forever fluctuate & change, so learning to respect it for what it does for you is life-changing
⚠️ no amount of external validation will make you love yourself… self acceptance comes from the inside.
🪞 the way things look on the outside may not be a reflection of how things actually are on the inside. The measures people take to live a certain lifestyle may not be realistic for you, so you cannot compare yourself!!
🫂 the body on the left isn't the way I look all the time & I hope to be just one person who shows you that you can show up as you are, because I wouldn't have been able to truly accept myself if I didn't embrace ALL of me. 

I know my posts won't resonate with everyone, but I do hope it reaches those it will help in some way! Happy Real Me Monday 🫶

T broke the silence saying “I definitely wasn't having a good day that day. Do you want me to tell you what I think was going on?”  No. I shake my head even before she's finished speaking. That's too scary. The scope of things that could be causing her to have a bad day is so huge and some of them would make things so difficult for me. I need to not know about her life. Now I feel bad for not letting her explain or seeming like I don't care. It's not that I don't care, it's just too hard for me to know because I care too much.  T said one thing had stood out to her from last session, and that was when I had a flash of anger when she tried to talk to me about eating and I said “you don't get to say that to me at the moment”. She said she could tell I was angry with her, and she asked how it felt to be angry. I said I didn't know but it felt uncomfortable to have her apologising to me. I don't like being apologised to. I'd rather shove it down and pretend everything is ok so that other people don't get the bad feelings. We talked about how much safer it felt to me to do that. She said she needed to apologise because what she said was her responsibility, and she got it very wrong. “I was being like your mum,” T said, meaning she had got caught up in judging or giving too much importance to the number on the scale. I said how snacking felt very shameful at the moment, because of how I'd mentally translated her words. She had said “oh you're eating snacks are you?” and my head translated it in to “No wonder you're gaining weight if you're eating snacks between meals”. I'm still struggling to shake off that shame. The ed is quite loud - my mindset has shifted in how I think about food, and it's not in a good way. Right at the end of the session, I asked her if she was muddling me up with her daughter, and saying things to me that she wanted to say to her daughter. I already wrote about that, but she said very clearly that we were very separate in her mind. I was glad to hear that. We didn't have any more negotiations about food or eating, and I am glad about that too. I'm not in a place to be receptive to T regarding that at the moment. Which is not to say I'm self-destructing or doing anything really unhelpful, I'm just not in the best place I could be or that I was a few weeks ago with food.

Doc ID: 2545, distribution: 0.5530830612996587 ; STORY TIME: When I was  years old, I went to a school disco that impacted my life forever (swipe to the rd frame to see a photo from it) 🥲 | ad.

As I walked into the hall, a group of girls circled around me. They laughed at the way my tummy poked out, called me names, told me I eat too much & shouldn't wear tight clothes, among other things.

That moment in time really stuck with me. I'm not telling you guys this for sympathy, in fact, I feel like that experience impacted me in a positive way because, eventually, it taught me the importance of kindness & self love. 

But, immediately after that happened, I decided to stay away from the food that was being served at the disco because I thought my body didn't deserve it. I also started wearing baggy clothes to hide my body.

That same way of thinking stayed with me for a few years after that. I spent my teenage years in a cycle of restricting & bingeing, feeling worthless & disgusting in my body 😣

I wish I could tell my younger self now that I was doing myself more harm than good. 

I wish I could tell myself “Eat. You need to eat. You deserve to eat.”

But this is what I've learned since then:
🍝 Food is your friend. It's energy! 🙏🏼 
🫂 Kindness can change the world!! Spread it whenever you can 🙌
💬 Words have power. Use them carefully 💛
🧬 Bodies come in all different shapes & sizes, this is normal! Yours doesn't have to look like hers!
🤳🏻 % of people are walking around sucking their tummy in, editing their photos, posing carefully & using angles to look the way they think they have to look. But the truth is, real bodies do poke out, they have dimples, lumps, marks, bumps, fat & cute lil stretchies. That's nothing to be ashamed of!!! 

Happy Real Me Monday, I hope this helps in some way ✨

As usual, it takes me some time to summon up the courage to say what I want to talk about. T sits patiently and waits. She won't rescue me anymore, she knows I get there in the end. Even after I told her what I wanted to talk about, I struggled to find where to begin. I think of ways to start, and then another part of my brain shoots them down. On reflection, that likely stems from my childhood. My dad had no patience for a story that wasn't thought through, or that rambled and didn't make sense. And all possible weaknesses had to be defendable. It means I overthink and freeze often when I'm trying to tell something. T gave me a way in by helping me get started, and then I was able to tell her the whole saga. I was really only telling it in order to talk about my texting dilemma afterwards, but it was actually good to explain at all. T was really encouraging and said I had done a good job even though it had cost me a lot emotionally. She started doing her psychodynamic thing, looking for links back to my childhood, but I said actually I really wanted to talk about something else and that was just the background. She smiled and said “Ok… and well done for interrupting me!” I told her about how I had a dilemma about texting her. I'm stuck between thinking that sooner or later I wouldn't be in therapy anymore and so she wouldn't be there for me to text her and so I should just learn to get on and cope with it on my own. And thinking that sooner or later she wouldn't be there and so I should make the most of it while she is there and (I got tied in knots here and ended up just reading out what I'd written which was “Make the most of it while she is there and it's ok to want to text her and I don't need to withhold it from myself”. I explained that withholding things from myself was an eating disorder behaviour, when the ed voice would tell me I could survive without x y or z and therefore I clearly didn't need to have it and must prove that I could manage without it. T said that she was absolutely happy for me to text her when I need to because she knows that I don't do it for just anything and only when I really need to. “I'm giving you something…. you're getting something from me. Some nourishment.”  Well that went a bit weird and therapisty 😳. I looked at her. She carried on, “One day you won't need to get it from me. You will be able to get it from people around you.” There was a long pause while I considered this. Eventually T said “You look like you're wrestling with some sort of dilemma?” I said “Yeah…. I'm just thinking…. that I did message H and my friends too, so I was trying to reach out to my real life supports too. But its like…. if a child falls over in the playground then their friends all try and make them feel better, and that's nice… but what they really want is an adult to come and look after them.” “Yesss…. that's to do with emotional regulation. When your feelings overwhelm you, you need someone more emotionally regulated to take your overwhelming feelings and digest them and give them back to you in pieces you can handle. That's what you didn't really get as a child, that regulation of your feelings. So you haven't had that experience and that's why it's difficult for you to do it for yourself now. That's why you sometimes need me to do it for you. But you are learning to do it for yourself, it's just a slow process. It doesn't happen fast. But that's ok.” I do think in some areas I am getting better at it. Like in fostering, sometimes something happens that makes me really mad or upset, and I used to always go to my manager and wail about it and she would speak to whoever and resolve it. But now I'm starting to think hang on, I can do something about this myself without having to run and get an “adult” to fix it for me. I'm learning to regulate myself more. Then T tried to do some grounding for the last few minutes and asked me a question about d, which I did answer but my brain was still on what we'd been talking about. So I said what I was thinking about… and then we were out of time.

Doc ID: 8001, distribution: 0.482132026808756 ; refeeding. in the eating disorder space, it's rarely touched on yet common in most recoveries. but what is it?
.
every recovery is different. personally, my recovery was from a restrictive battle with food. i had lost nearly half my body weight, and this time called for restoring weight. a lot of it.
.
when i finally began to eat again, i was afraid that the self-control i had cultivated over  four years would be “ruined”. that i wouldn't be able to compose myself when faced with a full plate. for too long, eating was an all or nothing task, and now that it couldn't be nothing, it had to be all.
.
i've been asked if i experienced “binge eating” in recovery, and here's where refeeding comes in. when the body is deprived of food for a long time and then food is reintroduced, it gets…excited. my body wanted to make up for all of those starving days and grumbling nights. .
for years i had tinkered with my body's natural messages. part of my recovery was relearning hunger cues. after awhile, they had disappeared, and now that i was calling them back home, they had to readjust. and they weren't exactly accurate. .
this isn't unhealthy. there is a learning period that comes with recovery, and feeling hungry even after a dense meal is not WRONG. your body learning its hunger cues is like you learning to do a math problem. both take practice and there will be errors along the way. but eventually, things begin to click.
.
when i was refeeding, i would eat large meals and feel hunger ten minutes later. i would grow frustrated with myself, angry for not being “normal”, scared that i was eating “too much”. i remember trying to rationalize with my body. “you can't possibly be hungry you JUST ate”.
.
what would i do? i would eat more, because my body was asking for it. the entire time i was miserable, confused, to be so full and yet so hungry. but i ate, because i had to show up for my body, had to allow it to fall before it could stand.
.
all of that just to say that recovery is a learning process. there is no correct way to recover. your body was subject to trauma, and now it needs to find its way back home. it's during times of discomfort that we grow the most 💫

T is being very patient and willing to hear me but we are mired in a sludge of difficult feelings. I just want things to get back to normal but we need to tread slowly and carefully to find our way out. I am still struggling to trust her after feeling that I was falling a couple of weeks ago, but when I reached out to her, not only did she not catch me but she gave me a little shove on the way as I went past. One nice thing that happened at the end of the session was that T asked me if she could make an observation about something she'd noticed. I nodded yes, wondering what she was going to say. “I've noticed that the little fimo dish I made you isn't there on your bedside table this week.” I'm touched that she thought about it and notices it there every week. The dish lives on my bedside table and I put my earrings and hair bobbles in it overnight. And the dish was still there! I lifted up my water cup from in front of it to show her. “It is here! Look!” T said “Oh I'm glad it's still there. I thought maybe you'd put it away because you were angry with me. Your little house that you made is still here in my office, even though you can't see it from where the computer is.” It was a nice connecting thing to finish with. I still love her even though things are tricky right now.

Doc ID: 2446, distribution: 0.40697457635535617 ; [TW: footage may be confronting] this is what falling in love with your life looks like 🥺🤝✨

If you're new here, you may not know my back-story or what inspires me to share what I do. So here we go…

From around yo-yo, I struggled with negative feelings towards food & my body image, I had low self-esteem, was stuck in a cycle of binge-eating & restricting, and I despised any & all forms of exercise. 

In , I started another “diet” & unfortunately remained in a calorie deficit for too long = became underweight, I was always dizzy, lost feeling in my right leg from the knee down & also stopped getting my period (AKA amenorrhea). I became obsessive: weighing myself & taking “progress” photos every morning + constantly body-checking. Even in my smallest body, I picked myself apart.

In , after my loved ones expressed their concerns for my health & habits, I decided to prioritise my health over my physical appearance in order to get my period back. I had to overcome my fears: increase my food intake, gain some of the weight back & recover my period. I was afraid I'd fall back into my B.E.D because of this…. but I didn't.

In , I realised that in order for me to find true happiness & acceptance in my skin, I had to turn inward & learn how to be kinder to myself. I owed it to myself to make my life FULLER & create a lifestyle that was balanced. One that could be sustained for the rest of my life, so I started approaching my health from an angle of self love & longevity instead. And I took you guys along with me on the journey!

These are just a few sustainable habits / hobbies that have made my life fuller & happier:

Honour my hunger
Move in ways I enjoy
Create a consistent (but flexible) routine
Throw out the scales
Be kinder to my body
Do something everyday that brings me joy
Seek the beauty around me
Take myself on dates
Show up as my true self, unapologetically 

This is what balance looks like for me. Healing my relationship with my: body image, food, health & fitness was the best thing I ever did. Now I have so much more space, time & energy for everything life has to offer 🌸

Doc ID: 21961, distribution: 0.5498485956981465 ; Question: i don't know how to ask this but did you go there willingly? what's it like? i need help and i'm scared  Answer: Hey! Making a decision about whether to go to the hospital is really tough and scary. It's a very personal decision and know that the staff there will be there to support you and keep you safe. It's hard to ask for help but you are so worth it and there are people who love you and care about you. Ultimately, going willingly is generally better because you want to be engaged in your treatment but it's also okay if you don't go willingly. Try not to feel ashamed about how you end up in the hospital and focus more on your recovery and moving forward. The first time I was hospitalized I went sort of willingly and sort of unwillingly. Basically, I was told by my achool's counseling center that I could go on my own or they would pink slip me (which basically means force me to go). I was then brought to the ER where I was formally pink slipped. This time, I was supposed to start a partial hospitalization program and the intake person suggested that I go inpatient instead. I agreed because I thought it would be best for me and I do not regret my decision.Each day follows the same basic structure but has different groups and activities. The first hospital didn't have groups so it was really boring. They try to keep us pretty busy here so we have groups and activities most of the day. The morning starts with breakfast at am and ends with wrap-up group at pm. I was pretty scared my first few days here but I've slowly adjusted and found my way. I've been here for quite some time now so I've gotten to know the staff and the other patients. We get a lot of free time and the groups and activities are never mandatory. They do take attendance and attendance is strongly encouraged but you're never forced to go. Unfortunately, it still gets boring around here even with the groups and activities. I've found that it's helpful to get to know the other patients because they get what you're going through and you can all support each other. I've met some really great people here and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to be at such a wonderful hospital. Please don't hesitate to send in more questions or DM me if that's easier for you. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I have plenty of time to do so.

Wasn't the conversation back when you were at a lower weight about how if you gained a bit back to your stable weight that it would help? And now she's like "ok yeah just go back there." Can't imagine how confused you were.. Answer: I feel like there must be something going on because she seemed so insistent on it being important that I learn how to lose a couple of pounds in a healthy way. Yet that is so far down the line of things relating to weight that it's important for me to learn, plus it's not even one of my goals or something I care about learning to do.I wonder if it's related to her daughter's eating disorder in some way.Yes it's very confusing for me. You summarised it quite nicely thankyou. You're absolutely right that she's been on at me to gain back to this weight which I am now at. And now I'm asking her for support to help stay here, instead she gets all sidetracked talking about weight loss.So confused.

Doc ID: 14593, distribution: 0.5590683570810415 ; Therapy .. // ending therapy thoughts  We had  minutes left after we'd spoken about the girls and their health kick and I asked T if we could talk about something else. I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  “Oh yes, I remember” T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . “I genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?” That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the “time to end therapy” is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said “uh I don't have much time left”. T said “Does it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?” and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside.

jumbo salted almond butter pumpkin stuffed chocolate cups

chocolate layer: 
-  cup chocolate chips 
-  tbsp coconut oil
  salted almond butter pumpkin filling:

-  soft pitted dates
- / cup salted almond butter
-  tbsp almond milk
-  tbsp pumpkin purée 
- sea salt
- pumpkin pie spice 

directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth. remove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer.

literally nobody but me was thinking this but here we are…

if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that i'm constantly finding new foods to cover in chocolate hahaha. very niche but never a bad thing.

anyway, very happy to report that this idea for dunking a smoothie in chocolate has been one of my best to date. these are SO fun to eat and the perfect snack— refreshing, flavorful, and super versatile. i went for a fruit based smoothie here but you can use any smoothie recipe that you're loving at the moment! 

details below!

chocolate covered smoothie cubes

make your favorite smoothie as usual (i'd avoid adding ice to keep the cubes from getting too icy— i used yogurt instead to keep these rich)

the smoothie recipe i used here:

-  acai packet
-  banana
- handful of frozen blueberries
- vanilla yogurt
- enough almond milk to cover everything

blend until smooth, the transfer to an ice cub tray. freeze the cubes for at least an hour or two if not longer (i froze mine ).

remove from the freezer and let thaw slightly while you melt the chocolate for dipping. i melted / cup of chocolate chips with  tbsp coconut oil in the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between. 

drop each cube in the chocolate and coat completely. the warm chocolate will begin to freeze pretty quickly on the cold cubes, so work fast!

you can enjoy as is (if the chocolate on the cube has frozen) or place back in the freezer for a few minutes to set. enjoy!

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
the *fudgiest* vegan brownies -flesh (no skin) of  large sweet potato (slow roasted: stab holes in the potato and coat entire thing with oil. roast at  degrees on parchment paper for two hours, flipping halfway)
- cup creamy peanut butter
-/ cup cacao powder
-/ cup maple syrup
-/ cup almond milk
-sea salt
-vanilla

add everything to a food processor and blend. it'll be really thick at first, so slowly add more almond milk as needed (if anything it'd be around  tablespoons extra). the final batter will be super rich and thick, like a whipped spread. spread into a well-greased brownie pan or mini loaf tin and bake at  for  minutes (you want this undercooked a bit)!

- sea salt

set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

this is what intuitive eating is all about. listening to our bodies— cravings are how our bodies communicate needs to us, so please listen! i ate a full dinner this night and felt content upon finishing, but later in bed all i could think about was a warm plate of freshly baked brownies. i wasn't physically hungry for them (think: no growling stomach) but mentally and emotionally craved them. 

i knew the longer i supressed this craving, the stronger it would get, until i'd likely binge on some brownies later in the week. instead i got up, made some brownies, enjoyed a few knowing that i could always have more tomorrow, and went back to bed. just like that.

i promise eating doesn't have to be complicated. it's so much simpler than we think— we've just been conditioned to overthink our intuition.

there's a lot here, but at the very, VERY, least… i hope this inspires you to make these brownies eventually!

Now I know some of you out there watching don't eat breakfast, and I'm definitely not here to judge you for it!! In fact, for a very long time I'd go for hours (and I'm talking hourssssss) in the morning before I'd eat anything. But now, I honestly love waking up feeling hungry and ready to eat breakfast 🌞 It literally gets me up and out of bed each morning! So this is just me giving those of you who skip breakfast a little suggestion: try eating something first thing. It doesn't have to be big, but trust me, I think you'll start to love it 😍✨
-
So for me right now I'm definitely on an oats kick 🤩 It's a very simple and quick recipe, but I change up the flavour each day by using different powders / protein powders. Angelo recently introduced me to peanut butter powder, and it's *amazing* honestly, so we mixed that into our oats on this day with flaxseed (a staple and great for omega-s) and topped it with banana and peanut butter 🥜
-
Ugali is another thing Angelo's got me on, and omggg you guyssssss!!! This stuff is my new fluffy heaven 🌥 It's basically maize meal (apparently Kipchoge eats it 🤓) and this fuelled our afternoon of cycling, running and pushing heavy things in the gym 😂

Obviously lots of snacks were consumed, but dinner was a big plate of yellow pea pasta from @zenb_uk #gifted 🍝 We had this with their cherry tomato, garlic and basil sauce, along with red lentils, spinach and veggies, and for dessert we made s'mores for the first time ever (although we didn't use the right biscuits this time) as well as some of the orange @soreenhq 😋
-
We did a bit of a food shop and I'm pretty sure the orange flavour is new, because we'd both never seen it before, but the squishy-ness was on point and we also go the @mydandies vegan marshmallows from Asda if you wanted to find them yourself 🍫

I went vegan in June back in  and I will never look back!! Yes, I once turned a blind eye to this lifestyle because it was “extreme” and “too expensive”, and grew up eating animal products. But for me, being vegan is the easiest thing I can do for the animals, to significantly reduce my environmental footprint, and I feel freaking amazing 🤩
-
There are so so many ways you can eat vegan. I choose plants in their whole form most of the time, but of course I'm always going to try the new vegan products that are launched and eat doughnuts, because hello this is lifeeee (thank you @doughnuttime_uk for this six pack 😉😍) 👌🏻🌱
-
I also encourage you guys not to get hung up on the label itself. Personally I call myself vegan, but remember that reducing your meat consumption IS making a change and you can *choose* not to buy dairy milk as a start. Nobody is perfect, but a little goes a long way, trust me 🌏
-
Now for the dEATs 😏 We decided to get experimental in the kitchen in the morning, so I made these oat crepes by @plantyou (the oat tortillas on her feed) and filled them with peanut butter and banana 🍌 so so good you guys!!
-
My rice bowl was a mixture of anything I could find in the kitchen as we were running low on food, but the combination of tahini and sauerkraut is definitely worth trying! Soya chunks are also a really good protein source so I added these to my pasta for dinner, and since coming home from Thailand I'm obsessed with cereal 😏👌🏻
-
As always, this is not for comparison, this is just a single day (each day is different) and I want you guys to listen to your own body, not mine!!! 🙌🏻✨

Big love as always 💚

vegan baked mac and cheese

sauce:

-  head of cauliflower, chopped into florets
-  cup oat milk
- / cup vegan cream cheese
-  tbsp miso paste
- / cup nutritional yeast
-  garlic cloves
- sea salt

start by boiling a pot of water for the pasta and preheating the oven to F. while that's heating up, steam the cauliflower. i do this by adding the florets to a microwave safe bowl, filling with water, and microwaving for - minutes or until softened. drain and add to a blender with the remaining sauce ingredients. blend until smooth and creamy. taste and season extra if desired. place to the side. cook the pasta for a - minutes below the suggested time (you'll be cooking it more in the oven). when the pasta's done strain it and add to an oven safe dish. pour the sauce over and mix until thoroughly combined. i topped mine with vegan shredded cheese and gluten free breadcrumbs. cook in the oven for about  minutes or until the cheese has melted. best served hot right out of the oven! i store my leftovers in the fridge in a tupperware and reheat in the oven for a few minutes when i'm ready to eat again!

This is my weekly phone dump for all of the 'bad', in-between photos that the gram was never supposed to see to remind you that for every perfect photo you see online, there are hundreds of imperfect real-life shots! It's also a little reminder to not take life too seriously... Posting these each week has been great practise for me to stop caring about whether other people think I'm 'pretty' or photogenic, that stuff really DOES NOT MATTER! It's also helping me be in the moment... In the past, getting nice photos was serious business, but now it feels more fun because the 'bad' photos don't seem so bad anymore. Practise getting comfortable with yourself for everything that you are... You're not just a pretty face! 😍👏🏻

Also, which one is your fav? I can't decide 😂

But I wanted to be able to sit at the bottom of the shower and share something HE didn't know about too. So tonight, as we sat in the shower and spoke about our days, that time inevitably came... Dylan went first, to cut it short, he pretty much summed up the art of happiness in one swift discussion (and nailed it). I, on the other hand simply said, "Well... Did you know that Elephants are the ONLY animal that can't jump?" ...

As you can see, the little blurry blobs in the background are people. I'm not the most confident person in a bikini so, of course, I got extremely embarrassed about people watching me pose for photos. Dylan kept encouraging me, saying “Of course they're looking, you're gorgeous!” and “It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks... You'll never see them again anyway and I think you're amazing!” but still, I was nervous. So in the end Dylan came up with another solution, “Will it make you feel better if I pose in front of everyone too?” and that's what he did. It really did make me feel better because . I was dying of laughter (swipe and you'll see why 😂👏🏻) and . Because he was right, I shouldn't let self-doubt stop me from anything, especially from having fun. So in the end, as the photos go on, you'll see I took his words on board and danced around on the beach IN A BIKINI at sunset 🌞

Doc ID: 15064, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you find it useful when anons call you out on stuff? Have you ever read something and realised they were right? Or does it just feel like an attack? Just wondering - I think some people try to call you out to help and some just to make themselves feel better, but was just wondering if it had ever been something constructive for you?? Answer: Sometimes there's something useful in there or some niggle of truth in what they say when they're calling me out, so yes it can be constructive in that way. Sometimes I can see why they're saying what they're saying. Often I feel that they don't fully understand the aspect of my life they're commenting on, which is understandable because I can only convey so much in a text post on tumblr. Then I catch myself and think that when I was deep in my eating disorder, I dismissed everything that everyone was saying - that's classic eating disorder behaviour. So then I check myself and look for the truth in what's being said.Some anons just seem out to make themselves feel better by firing off a rant, and even when that feels it's sent as an attack, I don't tend to take it personally. I appreciate it probably touched a nerve in them for them to decide to send me a message.I can only think of once or twice when anons have been really malicious and basically just trolls out to cause mischief with their messages.

The last decade has seen the rise of social media… It has pretty much taken over the lives of not only teenagers & adults, but younger kids too… I grew up being influenced mostly by TV, magazines, celebs, models, radio & my peers — & that did enough damage to my self-esteem — so it scares me to think about how harmful it can be to grow up today in an era of social media being accessible at your finger tips ON TOP of everything else in the media 😮‍💨 so that's why I post this series every Monday, to remind you of what's real & to gently nudge you to be kinder to yourself.

Several studies have suggested that social media exposure fosters body dissatisfaction & results in risky eating behaviour by broadcasting thinness ideals, comparison, perfection, food restriction, over-exercising & unrealistic beauty standards. And while I don't deny that I am in a thinner body myself, I'd never want to portray perfection the way I have felt pressured to in the past… I want to be a safe corner of the internet that shows up authentically & uses this platform to encourage you to be kinder to yourself 💛

Let's not continue feeding the message that belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, blemishes, skin conditions, belly rolls, wobbly bits, body hair, skin colour, hair type, body shape, etc needs to be “fixed” or changed.

We have friends in South Africa that we've been out to visit twice and were planning to go again this Easter until covid hit. My brother in law got married in Canada a few years ago so we had a brilliant holiday for that exploring Vancouver and Vancouver Island. We've also had some lovely UK holidays, from Cornwall to the western isles of Scotland where another of my brothers in law lives.Right now, I'd settle for a cheap week anywhere in the sun lying on a sun lounger reading books non stop.

As soon as I stepped off the plane arriving back in the UK, I said to myself that I didn't want to let go of the person I'd found in Australia: the new habits, mindset changes and little growth in confidence. So far it's been pretty successful. In fact, even people who knew me semi-well before as well as strangers (😱) have noticed a change, which is crazy.

Despite the mini what-British-people-call 'heatwave', it is very very unlikely to catch Holly in a bikini in her home country. In fact, I can probably count on two hands how many times I've been to a beach in the UK! I've certainly been to more beaches in Australia, and there you have it, that's the correct answer. Brownie points to those of you who immediately recognised this as down under 🌞

The combination of a very indecisive person and a global pandemic is the perfect recipe for a disaster. With deadlines looming, yes I'm stressed again. And when I feel trapped inside my head trying to make a decision, I'm the type of person that slyly creeps out of that small hole and thinks of a new idea. It's not a joke. It's a real problem right now 😳
-
I've tried to give you all the details in the latest vlog, but something I didn't talk about was my little analogy, thought up when I should have been sleeping the other day. Nice one, Holly, nice one. But anyway, it goes like this:
-
For so long I've been steering my way down a river that's already been carved out for me. Yes, there have been tight bends to meander around, but the point it, I sort of just followed a natural progression. From school, then to sixth form, onwards to university . . . oh and then solo travel (which I am determined will still continue). However now, not only do I have to float down the river, but I have to sculpt it's path first. And that, my friends, is what I cannot do right now 😬
-
But anyway, there's your daily dose of Holly waffle, and I hope you enjoy the video ✌🏻

Please don't feel bad about yourself or your life in comparison to others who seem to be doing better than you (in your eyes) due to their perfect, positive, put-together social media feed. Not everyone shares the ups & downs, the realness, their bad days or the vulnerable parts of their lives, but we're all human… And we all experience them!! ❤️‍🩹

Here are some pics to reinforce that 😂

For those of you who don't know, I had my wisdom teeth out about  days ago & I've been cooped up on the couch since then… I haven't had the energy to do much at all (hence the th slide & the  emails I have to get back to) so I thought it would be the perfect time to remind you that:

I could easily make my social media space look like the first slide only, I could easily not share these less flattering snaps of myself, I could pretend I've been super productive recently, I could pretend I don't feel a little guilty for not being productive as I recover, I could pretend I don't still experience my fair share of “bleh” body image days & I could make it look like I always have my shiz together, but THAT'S NOT REAL LIFE. I hope that's of some comfort to you guys. So as you scroll through social media or judge yourself harshly against others when seeing the put-together, cutesie or aesthetic photos like the first slide, please remember that they also have their nd slide days too 😂 & try your best to channel that gentler voice in your mind. You're allowed to be messy or less productive or not feel like a supermodel every day, but no matter what, you're doing amazing!!! 🌻

How are you REALLY feeling lately? Leave an emoji below that describes how you're going. Let's make the comment section an honest space ✨

Also I low-key look just like -year-old Bree right now (last slide) with my swollen cheeks post-surgery & I'm kinda here for it 😭🤭😬

We want to take a moment to thank the co-chairs @gillianbush and @eawaldron for all of your hard work and dedication to this event.

Thank you to the three of you for all that you do! 💕

Doc ID: 2903, distribution: 0.22384501741047513 ; If you can't tell, I'm sitting by the pool - which was where I spent almost every day while writing this book, because I really wanted my readers to FEEL what my characters were feeling. I would jump in the pool and take everything in: how my skin was bitten by ice as I first touched the water, to how my hair would sway softly with the waves and so on. The same goes with all of the scenes I wrote. For example, if my main character was running through a forest, I too would go for a walk through the closest forest and take in all the senses: sound, smell, touch, taste and sight. So I really hope that when Pembrim comes out, you can truly feel like you're inside this adventure and their world. On another note! This is pretty much me everyday as soon as I finish work 😂 working on my book with writing glasses on, no makeup and living in my pjs 🤷🏻‍♀️

Doc ID: 7383, distribution: 0.36384890016519617 ; i've gone through a lot of changes in the past  years. while many aspects of my life are in flux, one factor always remains constant: my love for reading. i fell in love with reading as a child. as a young teen, when my eating disorder took over my life and everything was darkness, i turned to books as a source of light. each novel was a quivering flame in a sea of suffering. i discovered that words gave me hope. the stories i read took me out of my own life, the one where i was in constant pain, and brought me somewhere beyond. to this day, falling in love with a beautifully written story is one of the greatest feelings in the world.
.
.
the past few weeks have been marked by unpredictability, by fear, by instability. i've turned to books during this time to once again bring me somewhere beyond. to help me cope. and quite frankly, to keep me busy. pictured above is my quarantine stack, aka the books i've read between march th (when i left school) and today. for my thoughts on each one, you can check out the 'reads' highlight on my profile. each one was fantastic. the nightingale and untamed are my favorites from this stack! . .
.
some details about my personal reading habits: yes, i buy my books new during this time. i'm eager to read, and ordering online is the way i'm choosing to nurture this practice right now. expensive? a bit, but this is an investment in myself. i pass my books along to friends and family when i'm done, so i know they'll be used and well-loved beyond my initial purchase. i also prefer tangible books over e-books as this allows me to find time off-screen and give my eyes a rest (i spend *plenty* of time online, so im all for reducing screen time)! i make sure to always have a highlighter with my when i read to note passages that simply took my breath away. i go back and read these later. they fill me up. words heal.
.
.
i spend hours reading. sometimes i spend whole days reading. this is the number one way i'm practicing self-care during the chaos of the current moment. i could not encourage this practice more. drop suggestions below for my next round of reads please! 🥰

I usually never post camera roll dumps like this because I tell myself they don't add value to y'all, BUT… you can't watch these lil snippets & tell me it didn't heal something deep within your soul 🥹 there's something so therapeutic about being outside of your own head & simply being present with nature, animals, movement, organising your space, etc. these are just a few things that have made my mind a nicer place to be lately & I hope it reminds you to make time for the things that make your mind a nicer place to be too 💗

You'll recognise some (or most) of this from my vlogs and other posts, but this island is really special to me ✨ It had incredible vegan food, including the best burger I've ever eaten in my liiiiiife, deserted windy roads to explore on scooters and it's where I kicked some 🍑 trying Muay Thai (😏), but this was definitely the hardest time for Math and I because we both got pretty ill.
-
However, I truly believe that it's during the lowest times when you really appreciate the beauty of travelling! I'm obviously not saying go and purposefully run yourself down, definitely not, but it's the most liberating feeling when you get through it and you're back ready to get yourself out there again 🙌🏻
-
As I've done in my other Thailand highlights, here are my top top recommendations for Koh Lanta (and if you haven't already downloaded my full itinerary, for FREE 😉 then it's linked in my travel planning video) 👌🏻

🇹🇭 For my foodies, please please please go to Fat Monkey and try the vegan burger, it's inCREDible, as well as Oasis Yoga Bungalows for French toast that can be made vegan and Happy Veggie for smoothie bowls 🍌

🇹🇭 We stayed at the Lanta Triple Novel and honestly, the family who run this place are so so nice 🥺 We also hired our scooters here and got a really good price as guests staying at this accommodation!

🇹🇭 Lanta Muay Thai Complex is where the sweat. is. at. you guys for Thai boxing!!! I did a private class but they also have group ones too 🥊

It's why I take myself on a solo date every week… Because it's not comfortable… at all, it's daunting, challenging but so liberating! Today I planned to do something that feels good, tastes good, challenges me and scares me. In that order. *I saved the best part of the date for last* 😮‍💨💀😅 [ad]

st stop — FEELS GOOD: move my body, because it's a blessing I'm grateful for every day! (except for the wardrobe malfunction lol 🙊)

nd stop — TASTES GOOD: refuel with sushi & a good read

rd stop — CHALLENGES ME: find my way through an optical illusion maze 😳

th stop — SCARES ME: catapult myself above all of the tallest buildings on the Gold Coast at kms per hour… on my own 🥲

If you had to take yourself on a date that feels good, tastes good, challenges you & scares you, what would you do??? It's fun, promise! 🏋🏻‍♀️🍣🤹‍♀️🎭🎢🎡

I know the idea of taking yourself on a solo adventure might sound weird or scary, but you gain strength, courage and confidence with every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. 

P.s. I know I'm gonna get asked a lot about my fits so I'm wearing my fav new red/pink set from the @gymshark Ombré range 😍 & then the cute yellow athleisure set is from the Gymshark Pause range! Link to shop is always in my bio 💗

Where should I go next week?! Would love to see your suggestions for me & others to do 🤗

Doc ID: 7386, distribution: 0.4472097263139044 ; i remember spending one birthday locked alone in my room with hunger pains bouncing violently behind my ribs, desperate to avoid a slice of cake. i remember spending another birthday in a day program in a hospital for my eating disorder, shuffling between therapy groups and weigh-ins. i remember counting the days leading up to my birthday and growing more and more depressed as it approached. the last thing i wanted to do was celebrate myself, celebrate my life, celebrate at all. .
.
today i turn . despite the current circumstances, i'm feeling deeply and wholly loved, eternally grateful, and immensely supported. each year my birthday leaves me at a loss for words. i can't help but think back to my younger self, to the shell of a girl living in pain and misery, losing a battle to an eating disorder, waking up each morning wishing she hadn't. she eventually found light in the darkest of places and fought back…even though it was the scariest thing she had ever done. without her i wouldn't be here. today i'm honoring another year of pure excitement for life. things change, people change...even if it seems like an impossible feat.

cheers to growth. to forgiveness. to more life 🌺i'm still not huge on birthdays, but i am huge on gratitude and also super sentimental, so i couldn't help myself with this one. bear with me 😅 heart is full today! xxxxxxx

*breathes* ... Hello friends! Wow life is crazy right now. Never in a million years did I ever think I'd be cramming all my most essentials belongings in just two bags and leaving to go solo travelling. This has been in the pipeline since July this year, and I'm now just two days away from sitting on that plane and flying (many miles) away from home.
-
I have very mixed feelings. A bit stressed. Anxious. Nervous. But I am just trying to go with an open mind. Opportunities likes this don't come around very often, and I have to be confident in myself that I can navigate an airport. Talk to new people. Make friends. And simply be myself ... just in a very new environment, that's all 😉

As I said in my last weekly vlog, my new hair has given me this new found inner confidence. It was certainly needed after a few low days, and it is something I definitely need when travelling.

Doc ID: 11204, distribution: 1.0 ; The Great Ocean Road 🌊
-
Before I arrived in Australia, this was one of my biggest worries on my itinerary. And that might sound surprising, but it was because the thought of going on an unguided -day road trip with people I'd only just met really made me feel quite anxious. And because the trip hadn't been booked in advance, unlike the rest of my travels, I was just getting super stressed (Darryl, you'll know 😅).
-
When I then arrived and completed my first tour with Welcome to Travel, of course the homesickness hit with full force and I did feel really overwhelmed. It has also taken time to settle down a bit too. Hence, I felt a lot more comfortable booking a guided tour. I did the -day trip with Wildlife Tours, which takes you all along the 'greatest ocean road in the world' (can confirm, the scenery and landscapes are amazing!) and then into the Grampians. It totally exceeded my expectations and I met some incredible people: definitely people I'd now call friends 🙌🏻
-
I am trying to make sure that I include all my first impressions, thoughts, feelings, worries and anxieties in my vlog series, because I think it's really important to just show you that I am a real person. I struggle a lot in social situations, especially in novel contexts, and solo travelling in really pushing me out of my comfort zone. I am also doing a lot of things for the first time, which is craZy 😬 ... and a lot of them are honestly CRAZY things that I never, ever, thought I'd do 🙈

Doc ID: 2560, distribution: 1.0 ; Come with me on the SCARIEST solo date I've ever had 😳😮‍💨🥲 with Halloween coming up, I thought I'd plan a solo date that terrifies me… 🎃 

I went to a water park… solo! 🙈 I've always been afraid of water parks specifically because as you guys know, I struggled with body image issues from a young age. I'd always avoided the beach/pools/water parks & was terrified of water-related rides because they seem uncontrollable unlike mechanical rides 😂 but since I've improved my body image, learned to accept myself & appreciate my body, I knew that one day, when I felt ready, this would be the kind of solo date I'd want to challenge myself to do!!

I read this quote a while back “The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do” & it resonated with me because I realised the person I wanted to be was confident in her skin / who she is as a person, she loves her own company, she's independent & unafraid… But I knew I wasn't just going to wake up one day & suddenly be that person, there were actions I had to take & challenges I needed to overcome in order to GROW INTO that person… So here we are ✨

Are you going to take yourself on a solo date? If so, leave a “🚀” in the comments!! I always love hearing where you'd go, so please feel free to share 😍

The protein oats, protein bar & cookies are from @macrmike's limited edition Halloween goodies!! I've used the Creepy Caramalised Apple Crumble almond protein with my oats, the Horrorcomb Protein Bar & the Spooky S'Mores Cookie Mix!! 🤤 You can get % off with the code: AMB-BREE + there's a link in my bio/stories to shop!

So you guys must be very familiar with my baggy t-shirts and tracksuit bottoms by now. In fact, you're probably familiar with my entire wardrobe, or at least the clothes I wear regularly 😅 Whilst I made a bit more of an effort whilst I was on holiday, I was certainly always repeating outfits and wearing the same clothes.
-
Personally, I find choosing something to wear one of the most stressful things in the whole entire world (dramatic, but very true). Hence, I always resort to my 'usuals'. More importantly, owning less and trying to avoid buying in to fast fashion is really going to help the planet, which you guys also know I'm all for ✌🏻🌎

-
Rest assured, it's just the final mini vlog from *this* travel series ok . . . I'll be back with my rucksack on in no time 😉 This is your final piece to the puzzle, because across both YouTube and Instagram I've pretty much vlogged every single day for this month trip (except when we were both ill 😴)!!
-
We left Koh Tao, where we did scuba diving with @lbdivingkohtao (episode  on YouTube), and travelled back to Bangkok. Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I'd recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I'd organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map 😅)!
-
Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani 😱😳 Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive 😂 But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today's vlog on YouTube (episode , live @ pm) 😏 I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it! I thought it would be more refreshing than it was, but it literally tasted like sweets to me in a liquid form lol 😆
-
-Eleven is always pulling through with the best snacks and quick food when you need it, and our final stay in Bangkok was in the Siam district with @lubdbangkoksiam ✌🏻 Make sure you watch out for today's vlog on YouTube, our final  hours in Thailand, and the moving home video coming out *tomorrow* with lots of family surprises 🤩

ps: i planned this whole itinerary myself, and i know you guys have lots of questions, but our diving in Koh Tao and stays with Lub D were both gifted to @matt.j.white and I very last minute (I was messaged by both whilst on our travels) 🙈✨

on this platform, we're constantly exposed to people sharing their highlights and promoting their businesses/products. 

which seems pretty successful, amirite?

but what you perceive as someone else getting it right or doing well might not always be the case. 

there really is a lack of transparency in our culture in general, and a tendency to want to make things look good from the outside regardless of what the truth is. 

if you're looking outside of yourself in someone else, and wishing that you have what they have, you could be wishing for way more than meets the eye.

when you look past a few layers, you may be wishing for something completely different.

take everything you see with a grain of salt, collect what you align with, and disregard what doesn't feel good to you.

ultimately, YOUR life is your goals. you have everything you need to create the reality you're looking for. sometimes those key ingredients are just hidden in the back of the pantry 🤪

Doc ID: 11137, distribution: 1.0 ; I'm sure many of you are aware of the recent events in America. It's upsetting, frustrating, and I'm not going to be silent. Whilst I enjoy sharing my thoughts through words, racism and white privilege are not often the issues I discuss. I want to use the platform I have to raise awareness of these global and prevailing issues, yet I know the eyes of social media are often very quick to judge. Your words can often be misunderstood, misinterpreted and even twisted.
-
However, this is a note to self. A note that I shouldn't just sit back and not speak up. And a note that just because I'm white, doesn't mean I shouldn't, and can't, talk about issues of race. I'll hold my hands up and say that I should do more to learn about the social problems that are still deep rooted in our society. But it's time to speak up about the topics we don't know much about, and step outside the comfort zones we seem to unknowingly trap ourselves within.
-
At times like this the privileges that have grown up alongside me, simply because the colour of my skin and that often go forgotten, strike me for being incredibly unjust. In fact, it's wrong. Yet they still exist. Again, I'm calling myself out for only raising this as an issue when the news of George Floyd's death by a white man hits the headlines. A side-note, but likewise, why is a global pandemic necessary to spark thankfulness for the NHS and the incredibly work they do around the clock, non-stop? Surely we should be talking about this all. the. time?
-
As single individuals, sometimes it is difficult to realise the power of our influence. Of course, our voices are only small in the face of these issues, but the petition is just a single example of how we can come together and evoke change. Racism still exists and we cannot sit back and expect it to go away staying silent.

Doc ID: 2583, distribution: 1.0 ; Swipe for the photos that don't usually make it to the gram, but you guys know me, I can never just post a “posed” photo of myself 🤭

I thought it was time for a new profile pic… Because if you somehow missed my dramatic introduction to my new hair yesterday, then surprise —  I'm brunette now!!!?? 🙊 

I've got a little challenge for you. Today or tomorrow, I want you to make the time to repeat the below poem to yourself, whether it's in front of the mirror, in the shower, on the toilet 💩, wherever. Repeat it until it sinks in. 

I did it myself today. I filmed it & added it to this post — swipe through to watch it — & yes it feels cringe-y to watch back, but it was the first time I'd read the poem aloud to myself & I was surprised by how much it actually affected me 🥺 hopefully it brings some reassurance to you too 💛

Here it is:
“Never trust a mirror, for the mirror always lies
It makes you think that all you're worth can be seen from the outside
Never trust a mirror, it only shows you skin deep
You can't see how your eyelids flutter, when you're drifting off to sleep
It doesn't show you what we see, when you're only being you
Or how your eyes just light up, when you're loving what you do
It doesn't capture when you're smiling, where no one else can see
And your reflection cannot tell you, everything you mean to me.
Never trust a mirror, for it only shows your skin
And if you think that it dictates your worth, it's time you looked within.”
- by Erin Hanson

-
Short answer: YES 🤩 But let's add some context first! So Koh Tao is where most people come to dive in the country. Thailand is also the second cheapest place in the world to dive, so I'd highly recommend you try it if you're travelling in Asia 🌏
-
I did my Open Water qualification in Australia and honestly fell in love with all things scuba diving, the ocean and exploring underwater 🐢 It's not going to be for everyone, just like anything in life (😅), but . . . you'll never know until you try, right?! Scuba diving is also thought of as this very 'high risk' sport. However, that's not actually true. When diving with a reputable company and you remember to simply breath and relax, trust me, you'll have a whale of a time 😉

🇹🇭 The first shoutout goes to Bryan (not Byron lol I'm so sorry) from @lbdivingkohtao who invited both Matthew and I to dive and helped me get my Advanced qualification! We couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I do have a discount code in the description box of episode  if you want % off from me 🤟🏻
-
🇹🇭 Pleaseeee try the food from Big Bite Cafe ✨ The smoothie bowls were amazing and there were lots of other vegan options too 🌱
-
🇹🇭 We stayed at the Fisherman Resort, made loads of cat and dog friends, and the staff here were so incredibly kind 🥰 It's on the beach, the gardens are stunning and they also serve really good food here (try the pineapple fried rice with tofu) 😍🍍
-
🇹🇭 There's a small Japanese place, called Asia Mood I think, which is a  minute walk from the Fisherman Resort, but there are lots of other places to get food nearby. I just hope that as tourism picks back up, the -Eleven right outside the Fisherman opens again because those stores are simply the best for snacks and convenience items!

Had we spent more time here, we'd have rented a scooter and explored further than just on foot, but we were really busy, and very happily busy, swimming with the fish over our three days 😆

Y'all have seen me take on Movieworld & Wet'N'Wild solo before, so for my non-Aussie or QLD followers, I wanted us to explore Dreamworld together 🥰 

There's nothing quite like being on a rollercoaster with no comfort person beside you. My solo dates have taught me to be present, to soak up the moment, to seek the beauty around me. I actually found myself laughing the whole time I was on these thrill rides, going km an hour, up in the air & thinking to myself “I'm alive!” — it sounds cliché, I know, but I have these moments a lot on my solo dates. I have enough time & space to focus on everything else around me, rather than be swept up in conversation with a friend.

Doc ID: 2555, distribution: 0.5692818554611805 ; Welcome to the most INTERESTING solo date I've ever had 🥲

Today reminded me that the most important opinion of you is your own! Be you, you are enough 💛

This was another day of overcoming old fears. Growing up, I avoided the beach because I didn't feel comfortable in a bikini. So if I ever went, I wore long t-shirts or a one-piece or a sarong or high-waisted bottoms, just to hide myself. For this week's solo date, I wanted to combat that! Here's how it went 👀

I MAKE THE TIME for these solo dates because it's so important to me to step outside of my comfort zone, challenge myself, grow as a person, maintain my own independence & learn about who I am, what I love doing & how I'm feeling. It's the perfect opportunity to sit in your thoughts, reflect & come back feeling refreshed! 

Even if there were a few doubts & negative opinions being projected onto me by a male stranger in his late 's 🥲

You'll always be “inspirational” in someone's eyes, yet “uninteresting” in someone else's. “Talented” to a friend and “talentless” to another. The world's never gonna agree on a definition of who or what you are, so just focus on you & do what makes you happy 🥰

As you can see, when situations like these arise, my coping mechanism is not to get angry or sad. I get up, shake out the tension/stressful feeling, go for a walk & repeat some affirmations to myself. These are a few of the things I do to help me reframe my mindset when I start thinking negatively towards myself. But tbh, after all of that, I still felt down throughout the day & that's okay too. Not every day has to be a happy one 🌧💛

All in all, even when you're in a relationship, I think it's important to date yourself & have alone time outside of your partner, friends & family! 🙌

What are some ways you work through negative feelings to bring some joy & kindness to your mind??? Would love to hear them 🌸

Also leave a “🙌” in the comments if you're gonna take yourself on a solo date!! Highly recommend ✨

Answer: She went on a Managed Move between schools because she was “struggling emotionally”, I think that was the official term. There were some difficult friendships, some stuff bordering on bullying and cyberbullying, and a lack of reliable pastoral support.What's made her want to go back is that because she is currently on the roll of two schools, stuck in the middle of the managed move when lockdown happened, her form teacher from her old school rang her to see how she was getting on. (This is Old School's policy, the form tutor rings everyone in the form every two weeks, whereas New School's policy is to keep in touch by email) Old School form tutor ringing to see how she was doing triggered off the huge need d has to be “cared for” by her teachers and has just made her want to go running back to that school, minimising all the other problems that went with it.

Saying goodbye is absolutely the hardest part of fostering. It is one of the most emotionally painful things I have ever done, and I've done it  times now. Sometimes I cope reasonably well with the grief, and sometimes it absolutely flattens me for weeks and weeks. There's been times I've felt I can't put myself through this pain ever again, but so far I've always gone back. We always have a break after a baby has moved on, and we don't go back on the list for a new placement until we've got ourselves emotionally back on track.

It's easy to not send them in and then just text the school the reason they're not there.

Answer: It has never really got to the point of us having to seriously consider that decision. Adoption is not the natural end point of fostering. Assessment to be foster carers and assessment to be adopters are generally two separate routes in the UK, so just because you've done one, doesn't mean you can automatically do the other without any further assessment. IF we fostered a baby and IF that baby became subject to a placement order (the court decided reconciliation with birth parents or relatives not an option) and IF there were no adopters nationwide ready within a few months who could be matched with our baby…. then we would consider adoption. However if we were to adopt, that would take up our spare room and we would have to stop fostering. And our heart is really for fostering, for standing in that gap for a child. So that's something we would bear in mind too.

(That makes it sound like I'm having a horlicks or something and I'm not, it's a decaf coffee, but there we go) I'm trying to think of something interesting from my day to report…. I ate three meals 👍 and snacks 👍, I did exercise outside in the fresh air, I did some more cross stitch this evening while watching The Great British Sewing Bee, and just before that we had our church small group on Zoom. So I think that ticks all the boxes for staying sane in lockdown.  I wrote my earlier tumblr post in  minutes while the baby was under the cot mobile and I was sitting on her bedroom floor. It's hard to get head space when H is using our bedroom as his Work From Home office, and three Not In School teenagers are in the kitchen, the lounge, the bathroom, their bedrooms…. I am dreaming of a day when everyone else goes out of the house simultaneously and I can just sit… in silence… 🤫

The days feels like they pass with very little windows for me-time. It's good to remind myself there were little bits of it here and there. I have lots of enjoyable things I'd like to spend time doing and I feel sad that I fit so few of them into each day. The baby is unhappy. She cries most of her awake time. I'm holding on to the fact she is nearly six weeks and I hope she's read all the books that say it should get better after that. I know it will get better eventually. I've looked after lots of babies that were unhappy at this age, but there seemed always something to explain it - drug withdrawal, medical issues, prenatal trauma. Of course all babies in foster care have trauma from separation from their birth parents, so maybe some of it is just that coming out. Or maybe she's just an unsettled baby. It's easier to cope with when there's a reason that you know about.

My nephews are  and  and adore their cousins, but they haven't ever been to our house before as usually we go up to their house (it being about  times the size of ours!) I have a rough plan for the weekend and for the meals so feeling like that's organised. My sister and family can have our bedroom, which has plenty of floor space for the nephews too. Then H and I will sleep in d's double bed. d will sleep in d's pull out bed, and d will just sleep in her own bed. The baby room is still free but there's no space for anyone to sleep in there unless they don't mind hopping in the cot.  Today my main task is tidying and cleaning. I have a mountain of ironing from the holiday washing, but I like ironing. I can catch up on the latest episode of The Apprentice while I'm doing it. Cleaning bathrooms I don't like so much but I must grit my teeth and just get on with it. I'll bribe myself with a reward for after I've done them. Looking forward to a glass of wine tonight too 🍾

Answer: Haha it's a great idea in theory but I think in reality trying to get them to do everything the way I like it would be more stressful than just doing it myself!!Sometimes we have struggles but when I'm calm and not exhausted, I know they are actually pretty good most of the time. D does a lot of the cooking and d has been learning to do the laundry in preparation for going off to uni. d is also helpful with the baby. d is pretty un-useful but I pick my battles.

Doc ID: 15017, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that's not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say  years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it's up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that's the foster care that we do. Then there's permanence foster care. This is when the child won't be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they're + and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there's adoption, where usually there isn't any contact with the birth family. There isn't much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic  weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the (+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it's done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were  years ago. However it's one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day . To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past.

I think I mentioned they decided to stay in a hotel rather than with us, and I got all paranoid about the reasons why. However my mum insisted that it was just because they didn't want to add to the chaos of our already busy house. Basically they wanted to make things easier for us and I confess there have been moments this weekend when I've been thankful they're not staying here as I've appreciated having the space (physically and emotionally) Let's put aside the fact that there's all sorts of logistics issues with them being in a hotel  minutes drive away, such as I have to keep going and picking them up/ dropping them off, which actually adds to the chaos of our busy lives. I trust their intentions were good. This morning is d's therapy appointment. I haven't told my parents she's in therapy and I don't really feel inspired to do so, but I may have to if they turn up here (after a lot of discussion last night, they decided they would drive themselves back to the hotel and take a house key to let themselves back in to our house this morning) while we're out. d has lost her voice so I'm not sure how well the therapy appointment will go anyway, but it was too late to cancel by the time d said she wasn't sure about going.

I ran  miles along the coastal path and the rest of the fam came in the car, but when we arrived at said beach, the cafe WAS CLOSED!! So, we piled back in the car and drove to “our” beach (near our cottage), where the cafe WAS open, there WAS phone reception, and the sun WAS shining. Don't know why we even tried to go anywhere else!  Also got an email from social services to say that the baby that potentially had been coming to us next week is now going to a residential unit with parent. Part sad and part relieved. Quite enough to focus on with current baby starting weaning, d and d going back to school, and d heading off to university.

I have never thought about the topic so I don't hold an opinion on it. One is  and the other is . You said in a previous post you're an on trend mom and I am not! If you had time to give some advice I'd be delighted. Yours hopefully, anon xx Answer: Hi anon, I had a somewhat similar dilemma about a year ago. I wrote posts about it but I can't remember what I tagged them… maybe #parenting. I presume you are thinking of the possibility of them having sex? (Of course if you're not and are just talking about staying over in a seperate spare bedroom because it's more convenient etc then yes I'm kinda ok with that) I don't know whereabouts in the world you are, but in the UK, the age of consent is . So a  year old who is having sex with a  year old is committing a crime and could potentially be charged and as a parent who is knowingly allowing that to happen, you could also be charged for that. So personally for me, it would be a big NO to be having a  yr old and a  yr old in a relationship staying over in the same bedroom. I'd explain my reasoning though and have a discussion with my child about it. I'd also be having the conversation about contraception because clearly that is either needed right now or about to be needed, and about using condoms as well because STDs are real things. And about consent. In fact, I did do all of those things in real life. I said no to having her boyfriend stay over until after d turned . I was trying to hold out till  but she wore me down. I would be bemused by a boyfriends mum asking if my daughter wanted to stay over at age … that seems inappropriate to me 🤷‍♀️ When I said I was an on trend mum I was really referring to keeping up with the crazes that happen at school. I definitely didn't mean I was a liberal mum. My girls would probably say that I'm somewhere in the middle, relaxed about some things and strict about others. Hope that helps x

Doc ID: 14758, distribution: 0.5871157555598961 ; Question: I've always wondered about you referring to foster caring as a job. Where I live, people who have foster children also work outside the home at full time jobs. I know you care specifically for very young babies so is it because of that or is foster care just different where you live? Answer: In the UK, if you foster care for a baby you can't really work. If you worked then you'd have to put the baby in daycare and that sort of goes against what you're trying to achieve in terms of building a secure attachment. But also babies have lots of contact with birth families during the week and you need to be around to facilitate that, and also meetings, reviews, and appointments. So it's not really practical to have another job at the same time.It is possible to work in a job outside the home if you foster older children who are in school, but probably not working full time and you would need a flexible job so that you can be available during the day if needed for meetings etc. It's also about having enough mental physical and emotional energy for the therapeutic parenting that children in care often need. It might be hard to have the energy to give these children what they need if you're working, it's hard enough working and having your own birth children, never mind children who need even more from you (as they rightly should).

as the youngest child in a big family, everyone took care of me. 

i'm used to just watching out for myself, meeting my own needs, and doing what i want on my schedule. 

it was a huge adjustment to constantly pay attention to another living beings needs, hunger/potty cues, and mannerisms. setting things/time aside for her, although different, has been very enjoyable at the end of the day. 

i love her snuggles, her zoomies, the way her eyes light up when she knows it's almost meal time, the way she gnaws at her teething toys, the way her tail wags, her tippy taps across the floor, and the way she twitches and barks in her sleep

when i'm mad at her i'm only acting like it… deep down i think everything she does is adorable but i can't let her think that 😅😅

 months ago i would have read this and been like “ok…. it's a dog Amanda….. 👀👀👀👀relax”

but NOW i TOTALLY get it. i can try, but i don't think i can even imagine the feeling of love a mother has for her own human child. i think my heart would explode on a daily basis😭😭

anyway, happy weekend! stay safe, enjoy, and also remember the people who didn't have independence on America's Independence Day… and the people who still don't.

No one is going anywhere, so with the baby there's no groups to go to, no car rides, no teenager activities to try and fit around, no evening activities to go out to that I need to try and get the baby asleep before I go. So the baby leads a lovely life that is just a constant round of feeding, snuggling and sleeping. When she wakes early from a nap, she gets more snuggling till she goes back to sleep again. It's nice. Maybe this is what it used to be like for babies back in simpler times. When busy lives didn't have so many demands on our time.  The first couple of weeks after lockdown occurred, I said to friends “this is a rubbish time to be a baby!” - mainly because I couldn't buy nappies, I couldn't buy formula milk, and no health or social care professionals wanted to come and visit us. But now I think “this is the best time to be a baby!” - just nesting and nurturing. Who'd have thought it.

Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.9187266357374543 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

Answer: We had our three children, the youngest was , and I started thinking about a fourth baby. H wasn't sure about four children and it took me a few months to talk him round. After he finally agreed, I started worrying that four children might tip us over the edge and it would have been me that pushed us into it. Around the same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster, and thought that was something we could do. So we looked into it and it seemed so right. I could still get my baby fix and H could stop panicking about the costs of raising four children. We went to an initial introduction to fostering meeting, and that started the whole process off.

Doc ID: 15319, distribution: 0.27517576329650173 ; Question: How long are the babies allowed to stay with you? Can you only have babies stay with you? Answer: We only take babies because our only spare room has a cot in it and it's not big enough for a single bed. The babies stay with us until the court process has been completed and they either return to their birth parents or they move to an adoptive family. That's usually between  months and a year. About  years ago, the UK government set a  week target from the initial care order to the final court order, and although extensions often have to be applied for, that has speeded the whole process up. The first couple of babies we fostered we had for nearer  years each, and that is a long time for a baby to be in temporary foster care rather than with their forever family, bonding and attaching.

I've made a macaroni cheese and broccoli bake for tea so I will definitely eat some of that. Eating hasn't been so good over the last two weeks due to my loss of appetite through being ill and also the low mood I've had. I need to get myself back on track before it spirals into anything worse. Maybe I'll mention it to my therapist tomorrow, although I don't want to get into a big discussion about it (too much else to talk about). I'll just tell her it's not been great but I'm going to make an effort to make it better this week.

It gives me all these opportunities to prepare her emotionally for the upheaval in ways that my parents never did for me. This evening she has been calculating her budget and talking about getting a job to and also doing some volunteering. I said they were great ideas and definitely if she has the capacity and wants to, she could go for it. But I said don't underestimate the enotional and physical energy required to settle in when you move to a new city and start a new course and meet new people and have to look after yourself for the first time. I said she might find that at first just doing that is quite enough and in that case not to put pressure on herself to do anything extra for a while. The other night I got a chance to talk to her about how she will have some days where she just feels really wobbly and like it's all too much and she doesn't want to do it. And when those days come, just know that it's really normal to feel that way and it will pass, like maybe you just have to see that day out and then go to bed and when you wake up the next morning you'll feel more positive. I think she's going to do just fine at university and will probably thrive on the independence once she gets settled in, but it can never harm to give her some tools so she knows that if she has bad days, she can get through them.

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

Answer: Well, we had had our three girls, they were ,  and , and I really wanted us to have another baby. H wasn't so sure and I spent a few months trying to persuade him. Eventually he came round to the idea, but then I had a panic and thought what if we have baby number  and it tips us over the edge, and it's me that's pushed us into that.So then at that same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster. I had taken some time out from my job as a doctor so that I could be at home with the girls, and when we started talking about fostering, I suddenly thought, we could do that! I could look after a baby and get that need met in me plus having a job while still being able to be at home with our children, and H could stop panicking about the cost of raising four children. We started looking into fostering, and doing all the assessments and before we knew it we were approved foster carers. It felt it was exactly the right thing for us to do then, and it still is now 🥰

Doc ID: 14671, distribution: 0.07997095145316217 ; Life update  Yesterday I went to see our last foster baby for the final post placement visit. Because of lockdown we met in a park for a walk. Unfortunately it was cold, icy, drizzly and misty, so not the best conditions but it was lovely to see her again and she was so happy to see me. She has my heart forever ❤️ We are still taking a break from fostering just now, although our social worker emailed to ask me if we were ready to go back on the active list. I said I'd let her know. I'm thinking of this time as my “annual leave” so I'm enjoying having a bit of time and space to relax (and supervise home-learning, cope with lockdown etc). I got all my boxes of baby clothes out yesterday and sorted them back into size order. They tend to get all muddled up as I'm taking stuff out and putting it back in during a placement. I met a friend for a nice long walk yesterday afternoon. She updated me on the domestic violence situation. The abusive adult child has temporarily moved out as things got really bad and the police had to be called again, which meant social services got involved again, which means she risks losing her two year old if she doesn't get him out of the house. Before he moved out, my friend also had the mum and two year old to stay in her house for three nights to keep them safe. She doesn't know if she's enabling the mum to not kick her son out by providing a safe space. Then after she's told me all this, she says don't tell anyone. I don't have anyone to tell and I feel like the pressure is off a bit because things are happening (police, social services) to keep the little one safe. I don't feel the same stress as I did a week ago. The mutual friend I did drop some pointers to had the mum and little one round for lunch and a chat, but the mum wouldn't share any details so my friend is still the sole carrier of this secret. My friend and I still debate what the best way to support the mum going forward is. It reminds me of Janet Treasure's how to support someone with an eating disorder, are you a dolphin or a whatever the other supporter-types were, I can't remember now. Today the sun is shining and we are hoping to go for a family walk. The UK news is full of one police force yesterday fining two women £ each for driving  miles from their house to go for a socially distanced walk with a cup of peppermint tea each, because they “left their local area” and “had a picnic”. Thankfully I don't live in the jurisdiction of that police force but I'm still not sure who decides where your local area ends. We want to drive a couple of miles and then walk. I think that'll be ok.

Doc ID: 16036, distribution: 0.06405191297422777 ; I've had a manic morning. Baby fed at .am and .am last night, which made for a rather broken night, although she did settle and sleep well in between. She just takes a long time to feed. Thankfully then she slept through till .am, which gave me time to wave all the girls off to school with a bit of individual attention each on the way. All three of them managed to walk several times past their piles of clean laundry on the landing though 🙄 but I think that's standard for teenagers. Baby fed and then I gave her her first bath since she came to us. She wasn't impressed and cried the whole time till she was snuggly wrapped up in a towel again.    I had to phone d's new school as the issues that caused her to move schools just won't die down. I think teenagers just don't think about what they're doing or what the consequences might be. I reported a threatening text d received to the police over the weekend so I'm waiting to hear back from them. This has gone on long enough. d needs the chance to settle at her new school without all this horribleness. Unfortunately the older brother of the girl who's caused a lot of the problems at the old school was moved to d's new school a couple of years ago, and he is now sticking his oar in with some horrible comments. Managed to shovel some scrambled eggs (and toast!) in while hustling around and organising, then took baby out to the contact centre to see her mum. While baby was in contact, I went for a run. It was hard hard hard. I ended up in a local cafe where I enjoyed a blissful  minutes sitting down with a coffee before going back to collect baby. We arrived home about .pm and it was such a relief to plonk myself down on the sofa. I've been waiting for the midwives to visit since then but there's still no sign of them. I'm suspicious they've forgotten. Nothing ever goes smoothly in foster care. I'm tutoring in  minutes and I could do with them having been and gone by then! Seems unlikely eh.

What is the best and worst thing about fostering babies? And did you choose to foster babies only? Answer: Thankyou ❤️The best thing is that I love babies and I get to use that in a job where I can be at home for my family and also make a real difference to someone's future. I'm good at caring for babies and it comes very naturally to me. So all in all it's a very satisfying situation all round.The worst thing is having to say goodbye to them when they move on. I think I should say that's the hardest thing, rather than the worst thing, because ultimately it's the best thing for the baby - moving on to their new and permanent future, whether that's reunification with their birth parents or moving into adoption with their forever family. But there's no way round it being hard, both for the baby and for us.Yes we chose to foster only babies, because our spare room has only a cot in it. So we can only take a child who would be ok sleeping in a cot, or obviously the Moses basket in our bedroom. We don't exclusively foster newborns but that is usually who gets placed with us. We've had two babies in the past who were both a few months old when they came to us.

Beautiful madness. We visited my in-laws and saw our niece for the first time since she was walking. I went all the way to the Shetland Islands for a weekend to run the most northerly park run in the UK. More madness. While we were up there I saw puffins for the first time. Amazing. The baby and I went on a mini-retreat to the seaside and I had a bit of a breakthrough thinking about therapy things. I went away with H for two nights and we stayed in a cow-themed room. The baby and I had a lovely day out to a country house and saw penguins. My sister had a festival in her garden for my BIL's big birthday and we all went up for the weekend. My mum and I did one of the most scenic parkruns in the UK along the shore of the lake. My teenagers had birthdays, grew up, didn't want to have days out, didn't tell me when they would be home, stayed up all night on their gadgets, slept in till midday, and did all the other things teenagers are supposed to do in the summer holidays which drive their parents mad. I ❤️ them. The baby and I had a daytrip to meet up with @raspberryrose and her baby, which was fab. A sudden heavy rain shower put a rapid end to our picnic but then it passed and we spend the afternoon pram pushing in glorious sunshine. I tag @raspberryrose , @eattodefeat and @productivetimewasting if you want to join in.

Then we have had a little girl we fostered as a baby, and her sibling over for the day. We're trying to stay involved in their lives and be a protective influence, but the boundaries are tricky to negotiate sometimes. However we made the decision to stay involved and support them several years ago and now we stand by it. Today we took them to the park, had lunch in the cafe, played in the playground, scootered around, then came home and baked and decorated biscuits. That led into teatime and then we took them home at bedtime. Their little family is hanging in there, just managing to stay the right side of further social care intervention. I really want to give the children some good experiences and be a caring, interested adult in their lives, but I also don't want to promise more than I can deliver or be more involved than we can sustain for some years. I really don't want to build their expectations up and then let them down. It was great to see them and fun to hang out with an age group that's not babies or teenagers! d and I went straight from their house to the gym for a swim, and now finally we are home and I am heading for bed.

The adopters came at am as per the schedule so they were here when baby woke up. Luckily she is not an early riser. We spent the morning together and I failed to eat breakfast. They went and my friend came round for lunch. T texted me to ask how the eating was going, and I replied “Can I just say 'fine' because the reality is too complicated to explain?” which really should be read as 'not fine'. Friend brought soup (sweet potato and coconut daal by Glorious) and we had it with some bread. I finally managed to get hold of someone at school to talk to about d, so at .pm we trailed down to school. d was at home today having a mental health day, following some hard core crying last night. The meeting went well and hopefully helped d a little bit and we made a plan to get her through the next two weeks till the holiday. I cooked a sausage casserole for tea and served it in bowls with crusty bread. It only really made four decent portions so I had a bowl of roasted (baked) veggies and spinach with tahini. I need to get my act together with eating. Mostly I just think “T is going to kill me next week” which is an unhelpful thought coming from little-me who doesn't want to take responsibility for her own eating. This evening I've been doing endless online shopping for a) food and b) things on the holiday kit list and c) things on the holiday kit list that are cheaper to buy on amazon. Interspersed with that I took d for another practice drive, she is getting less terrifying to be in a car with and it is good I can see her progress even if she does still scare me. Driving instructors are heroes. I think I said that before. Thankfully no one had a crisis tonight, because I have nothing left to give anyone. I hope I sleep better tonight too.

We drove there, picked her up, went to a lovely pub for Sunday dinner, then went for a walk in a local park, stopped in a coffee shop and then took her back to her accommodation and came home. It was a bit of a long day out but it was so good to see her and she kept saying how nice it was to do a normal and non-studenty thing, and just walk around a different area and see families doing normal family things. She seems to be much more settled at uni now, starting to find her feet and enjoy her independent living. I'm writing about it here because I can't post it on any other social media, since we were breaking the rules. We left our tier and went to a different level tier which we're not supposed to do. And then we went out for a meal (and later a coffee) and said we were all one household, which strictly speaking we currently are not, because d is in a household with her student flat. To order in the pub, I had to create an account on their app, which I had to invent a local postcode for. I couldn't use d's postcode because it's for a student flat so evidently not a family home. So much deceit. I feel very guilty. This aspect of the rules is very difficult for me, the way it divides students from their families. I just cannot get my head round my child who is only just over  no longer being in our household. Especially when come Christmas she will be back home with us again (so help me, UK government if you change that rule) so is it really that different.  Anyway this is my confession. I think our visit was very important to d and her mental well-being so I don't regret it. Now England is about to go back in to full on lockdown, d may come home again in the next few days and we will be back to being one household again. Or she may decide to stay at university. I don't know yet, I think she will be swayed by what her friends there decide to do. I think it will be possible to get her home in the middle of the lockdown period if she changes her mind so I don't think it's a now-or-never kind of decision.  Oh while I'm confessing, I also let d out of her  day self-isolation period  hours early because she was becoming one with her bed and that wasn't doing her any good either. She had no symptoms so it seemed unlikely she was about to suddenly develop any. Anyway there we are I have off-loaded my conscience. The baby and I are off for one last Covid-secure swim now before the gym shuts again for lockdown. It will probably be our last ever swim together. Bittersweet times.

D is safely settled into her uni flat and her flatmates seem friendly. Her room is comfy and she has a nice view from her window. I think it helps that she moved in on a gorgeously sunny day, so everything looked warm and happy!  It was hard to leave her and to think of her “all alone” in another city. I wanted to snatch her back and bring her home where I can look after her! But as my friend always used to say, our job as parents is to give our children roots and wings. And this is a time for wings. I have still got her on find my iPhone and I get a lot of comfort from looking at that and knowing where she is. I'm sure my need to look at that will lessen over the next few weeks. It's by no means a checking up on her, just getting comfort from seeing where she is. After we'd moved her in, we took her off for a big food shop to a nearby supermarket. She is quite clueless in a supermarket, which is my fault because I always do an online delivery so she's not used to going round one, other than popping in for a few bits and pieces. We bought her quite a lot of staple student food. No raw meat because I don't believe she knows how to cook it safely! We bought quite a lot of the same foods we have at home, like brioche, cereal bars, cherry bakewells etc and I hope some familiar foods will help her feel grounded while she learns to branch out. I hope she's snuggling in her bed this morning feeling reasonably ok, relishing her independence and getting ready to go for a little explore later. I'm trying not to text her too much even though I want to every second of the day. I can't believe I have brought up a baby all the way through to launching her into the world.

Good things have happened today. I went for a lovely run this morning, while the frost was still on the ground and the sun was shining and was home by .am to get on with my day. I thought I would spend the whole day after that in comfy clothes on the sofa, watching Greys anatomy and organising a photo book. But as I came home from my run, I discovered H hadn't taken his car to work, so I offered to take d out driving in her free period. We went to the gym car park and spent an hour reversing in and out of spaces. She definitely improved, which was encouraging for her and rewarding for me. Then I got home from that and found the oven had terminally broken 😫 so a mad scramble to buy a new one while all the black Friday deals are still on. H wouldn't answer his phone, which made me really grumpy and unable to move on to the next thing till I'd got through to him. I won't go on because it's b o r i n g but the day carried on being meh, even through our annual tradition of Christmas bauble buying 😭. The girls still insist we carry out this tradition but then actually have minimal interest in choosing a bauble and basically grab the nearest one so they can go and look at iPhones in the tech department. I think it's time to change the tradition up a bit. Although I can't tell how much of my negative feeling is due to my overall negative mood. If anyone wants to cheer me up, please go for it.

___________
I know this year had forced a lot of us to make adjustments to our plans. It's forced us to take a second look at our expectations, priorities, and beliefs. Im sure you've already seen the recommendations to stay healthy and sane during quarantine: keep a routine, stay active, eat healthy, drink fluids, and sleep a little more, read, create- or don't, accept, and allow.
___________
Id like to add one more thing to this: gratitude. Not gratitude for your body or your family but have gratitude for this moment. Flip your perspective and try to think of how this could possibly be your teacher. What can this teach you about yourself/the world? Why not be grateful for a free life lesson?
___________
There are a thousand ways you can feel and think about your present situation. personally, I'm grateful for all the times things did not, don't, and won't go my way. I'm grateful for the lessons they teach. I become more patient, more flexible, more resilient, less attached, less heavy the next time around

Answer: Well there's a massive job description but it seemed to boil down to “having some experience working with people” and a “willingness to undergo training”. No most of the time I don't miss working outside the home, only occasionally when I find myself in a hospital it's hard being on the “other side” as a patient. I miss being in control as the doctor, having access to all the tests etc to help work out what's going on with someone, being able to look at the evidence for and against my theories etc. I loved my job but I wouldn't say I miss it, because I feel really fulfilled now in my life as a mother and a foster carer.

Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.

whether it's because...

your body has changed throughout the pandemic, and you feel anxious about your classmates, coworkers, friends, and family seeing you,

you've enjoyed having the excuse of lockdown to turn things down without having to explain your real reason,

you've lost someone during the pandemic, and going out into a “new normal” while grieving will be hard,

you're an introvert and want to hold onto the option of staying home all day,

you are chronically ill and don't want to feel left out again as everyone around you starts living with less restrictions,

or you've simply gotten used to this, and change feels scary and hard,

you're not alone.

one quote i read recently that gets at what i'm trying to say is, “normal is an illusion. what is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly”, so if you feel nervous, anxious, scared, worried, or upset about easing into a “new normal”, please know that your feelings are valid.

As a Swedish-American living in the US but with plenty of family in Sweden, my thought is that Swedish people are just really healthy. I don't have any numbers to back that up, but their welfare system is well-developed, people generally live in good and spacious conditions, etc. I believe I read the people who have died in Sweden are elderly and/or refugees(who don't have access to all their resources...). You're right, it is interesting. Answer: I agree Sweden is a healthy place to live, I also have UK friends living there. However if you look at the deaths per million, Sweden have the th highest in the world so they're maybe not doing that great. But even the deaths number is so variable between countries, including or excluding as it does different settings. And being variably representative of the truth in different countries. I think looking back eventually at the excess deaths will give a more accurate picture but we'll probably never know the true numbers.

at the start of quarantine, i initially struggled quite a bit. but, after facing and overcoming some challenges that came up when old behaviors were triggered, things felt pretty smooth sailing for a while. i thought i was all good- “healed” even.

thing is, healing is not linear, and i know that, but sometimes i forget to be gentle with myself when it actually applies to my life.

recently, everything feels like a lot, so much so that at times, it feels like nothing. i've been struggling to find my groove and feel at home again, and i've been feeling a lot more emotional and irritable.  right now, i am going through a trial and error phase of finding new ways to cope, and it's been frustrating at times. i feel like i should be over this by now and just know what i need, but i'm also understanding that as my life changes so do my needs and desires.

rather than shut down when the emotions bubble up, i remind myself that i am safe to surrender to them because grasping onto a false sense control has never been the answer, letting go of it has.

frustration, joy, change, freedom, sadness, discovery, peace, frustration, chaos, excitement, love, disappointment, etc...cheers to embracing it all without judgement or expectation.

Therefore avoiding lots of people becoming sick/negating the need for herd immunity. That seems to be the approach of countries like Singapore Answer: Theres a tiny chance but I don't think anyone realistically thinks the virus is going to just die out. It's here to stay. It's so contagious and someone somewhere in the world will always have it, so it will then be retransmitted. Naturally acquired herd immunity is a problem because we don't know yet if people will be immune once they've had it or if they are, how long that immunity will last. A vaccine seems the most likely prospect for managing to live alongside this new virus.

No precaution on its own is foolproof but multiple precautions decrease the chance of the virus being transmitted. I had a bit of a revelation that in a similar way, this is how I see eating lunch. I am very happy to eat lunch, but I have a list of requirements that must be in place for me to do so. For example, it must be after pm, the baby must be asleep, there must be nothing outstanding that needs doing, ideally no one else in the kitchen etc. All the Swiss cheese slices must be lined up with a perfect hole passing all the way through and I can only eat lunch when that happens. Seeing it in this picture format has made it feel quite clear to me. This week when I've caught myself waiting for everything to line up, I've been able to see what I'm doing and remind myself that I'm going to have to remove some of these Swiss cheese slices in order to get back on track with lunch.

Baby's mum phoned in sick to the contact centre, but no one thought to ask her what her symptoms were. Contact centres could be hotbeds for viral spread, given the number of people going in and out of a small number of rooms all day every day. Plus there is VERY minimal (ie none) cleaning and sterilisation of toys etc going on between each contact session. I have fired off some emails enquiring about protocols. Schools are all still open but d's school has sent a letter saying that if they have to partially close due to teachers self-isolating or being off sick, certain year groups will be prioritised to continue going into school while other year groups will be told to stay at home.

Because now services will expect us to be willing to facilitate contact etc etc and there will be conflict if we declined the vaccine and then don't want to take risks. Personally I think teachers, police, supermarket workers, anyone who comes into contact with many many members of the public each day should be more of a priority.  But anyway, H had his vaccine, so now he can go back to sitting in his work-from-home office seeing no one all day every day.

Answer: Oh yes, I've not been doing very well at keeping it secret. I've told my immediate family (d also got the vaccine because we were volunteering together) and also my extended family. And my friend. People I trust. I think it's more just don't broadcast it all over social media. I figure here doesn't count because it's anonymous. Actually I think maybe it's not quite such a big deal now because there's been quite a lot on the UK news today about how none of the vaccine must be thrown away and it should all go into the arms of people, so there'd be more understanding now of how we came to receive it. But probably not all the volunteers all over the country will get a chance to receive it, just because of different clinic circumstances, so I don't want anyone to think it's unfair.Do you mean different phases in the vaccine roll out?

I'm not saying it's right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to “normal” - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn't change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I'm not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don't know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don't know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren't yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said “The only thing worse than no test is a bad test”. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren't reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let's see what today's press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic.

Answer: Hmm well for me it means I basically don't leave the house except for exercise, or once or twice a week to volunteer in the vaccine hub. It's work from home for H and school from home for the girls. Nobody else is allowed in the house or garden and we're not allowed to stay away overnight. I can meet up with one other person at a time outside in a public place to exercise, such as go for a walk together. We have to stay local for exercise, although there's no set rule on what is local, which means everyone interprets it differently (including the police who can and do impose fines if they consider you're not staying local). Non-essential shops are closed, but we can still shop online. We get our supermarket delivery once a week and so we generally don't have a need to go in any other shops anyway. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are closed although they are allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services so some have found ways to stay open.

Doc ID: 16351, distribution: 0.15487233088586752 ; Question: When do you need to get your first cervical screening? Does it hurt? Answer: In the UK, it's at age . You should get a letter from your doctor inviting you to go. If you have never been sexually active, you are unlikely to need screening so check that out with your doctor before you go. This is because cervical cancer and the pre-cancerous changes that screening aims to pick up are connected with the Human Papilloma Virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. In the UK, teenage girls are routinely vaccinated against this now but you should still attend screening when you're invited. Teenage boys can pay to get the HPV vaccine privately currently, but I think they too may soon get it routinely on the NHS.No it doesn't hurt. It can just be a bit uncomfortable, but it's over really quickly. The more you can relax, the more comfortable it is - but of course that's easier said than done. I was able to chat to the nurse all the while she was doing it. I even commented that maybe I should have shaved my legs, and she made a pshaw kind of noise, like leg-shaving was so irrelevant in the world of cervical screening that she couldn't care less what state they were in.

Even people who've had two doses here, we aren't allowed to be hugging each other or going inside someone else's house or even into their garden. We can't leave our local area (vaguely thought to be  miles from ones own house).Maybe when the lockdown ends and the country opens up again it will feel different.

Doc ID: 15951, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you still believe quarantining the population is not effective because eventually everyone will catch it anyways? And earlier you said if no one catches it we are not building herd immunity? Is this true?  Answer: Hmm I think that's a bit of a twist on what I said. This is the situation as I understand it.Quarantining the population is effective because it *delays* the transmission, flattening the peak of the cases and decreasing the chance of the health services becoming overwhelmed. In the UK, we are all socially distancing and keeping  metres away from anyone not in our household. All non-essential businesses are closed. This will remain in place until the “surge” is over and the numbers of cases stabilise and fall to a manageable level for the health service. Then it's probable that some elements of the social distancing will be relaxed, and what is likely to happen then is that as we start to mingle again, the case numbers will gradually rise again. Then there'll be another clamp down and social distancing measures put back in place. This relax and tighten process will potentially be repeated several times over a period of months. Many of us will catch it during this time, but for lots of us we will have only very mild or no symptoms and may not even realise we've had it. If they bring in antigen testing, we will be able to test to know for sure who has had it.It's all theoretical at the moment because no one knows for sure how the virus behaves. We don't know yet if we will be immune to it once we've had it once, so it's hard to know whether we will as a population develop herd immunity but I think that's kind of the idea once most of us have had it.

⁣
“I've written and rewritten this post in my mind a million times over. A reminder not to panic, but to stay informed from local resources and wash your hands? An honest moment of there's a pandemic, and I'm still struggling with body image? A vulnerable question- how are other humans in recovery from self harm navigating the medical aspect right now?⁣
⁣
Then it took the shape of questioning treatment practicality- "the WHO says I should wash my hands. My OCD exposure says washing my hands is the last thing I should do right now." A call-out of my own privilege in this mess, as a healthcare professional and a relatively healthy young adult? Strategies I'm trying to use to keep my hands away from my face (a unique challenge with a BFRB)? What about all the uncomfortable emotions self quarantining is bringing up? Ways that I'm engaging in connection and keeping myself occupied? How I'm learning to cope with the drastic routine changes, switching to telehealth and the heavyness that brings? How I'm dealing with the anxiety of the invasive presence of COVID- everywhere I seem to turn?⁣
⁣
These are all important questions in a sea of many more. I don't have clear or easy or happy answers.⁣
⁣
I could write all these posts, and maybe I will. In asking all these questions, I have already begun. And this pandemic is taking a lot out of all of us, and so all I have left is compassion spilling out of me-⁣
⁣
Whatever you're feeling, however you're coping, no matter how much crying (or not!) you're doing- I see you. I'm there, too. And if this all feels unpredictable and unbearable and suffocating- I'm sorry. I wish you weren't hurting. I wish I could experience this for you, take it away. I know you need to feel safe, heard, held. Until that happens again, I hope you can find something nourishing. I hope you can find moments to breathe, seconds to smile, peace to rest. You are valuable. I know you are coping to the best of your ability, and I am proud of you.” - @sarah.is.smiling

Doc ID: 14661, distribution: 1.0 ; It has really been on my heart to help out with the COVID situation in whatever way I can. Obviously I'm already doing the vaccine trial which is ongoing. I applied for a job as a vaccinator but that doesn't seem to have come to anything. Then I volunteered to help out with the mass testing in d's school, which would have come to something if all the schools hadn't then been “shut” (I know they're far from being shut). Then a friend mentioned she was helping out marshalling at her church which has become a vaccine hub, and I said to let me know if they need more volunteers… and so finally tomorrow morning I can go and play a part in the vaccination effort. I'm excited to have a “job” to get up and go to (.am though? Haven't been up that early for a long time). I hope I can help ease the way for everyone coming for their vaccines in whatever role I get allocated to, and be a tiny part of getting the UK out of this pandemic.

Answer: We got the Pfizer one first but now we have the Oxford one just starting to roll out too. I don't think we have the Moderna one yet but it's on its way.It's a bit of a mind boggle to me how they will make sure everyone can get the second dose of the vaccine they had the first dose of, and how much vaccine to allocate to second doses while they're still rolling out first doses. I'm sure the NHS logistics has it in hand but it is also a bit dependent on delays and timely deliveries of the various vaccines.

Doc ID: 16017, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I dont live in the UK so I dont know all the details, but from what I've seen it sounds like boris Johnson is not handling the coronavirus appropriately. Why aren't they shutting down and taking appropriate steps? It seems like he has made very insensitive comments about how some people will die and that he just doesnt care about the vulnerable population. I'm curious your thoughts Answer: Boris Johnson and his scientific advisors have made their recommendations on the basis of scientific predictions. I do understand the logic - we need around % of people to catch corona (and survive) so that we have herd immunity because this virus is likely to be a seasonal thing now. Also we need to flatten the peak of cases occurring now so that the healthcare system can cope. Plus people can only cope physically and emotionally with self isolating for finite lengths of time and may start disobeying it right at the critical time if we start too early. If we close the schools, grandparents may end up looking after the children thereby putting a vulnerable age group at more risk of catching it. Their model says schools would need to be closed for - weeks for it to be effective at preventing virus spread, which would clearly have a massive effect on the country.It's true though that people will die. I think Boris said that so we all appreciate the severity of the situation and the importance of doing our bit - handwashing, self isolating etc. Unfortunately it did come across as a bit uncaring and when we look at what the rest of the world is doing, it's hard to keep faith in the UK government that their policies are enough when many other governments clearly think differently.Partly also the UK is somewhat behind mainland Europe in the course of the pandemic. We still have relatively low numbers of covid . So their advice may change over the next few days and weeks as the situation changes.I'm following the BBC live news feed quite obsessively to keep up with the world situation.

I had the vaccine  weeks ago and my behaviour hasn't changed one bit as a result. I still wear a mask, still social distance and definitely have not been hugging anyone outside my household. It never occurred to me that after having the vaccine I could do any other things… I don't know if that's just me being dumb.  Probably it's partly me because I know I'm quite black and white about things, and I just follow the rules, vaccine or no vaccine. So as and when UK lockdown relaxes, I'll go with that. Maybe it's partly that I'm lucky that I'm quite happy with my lockdown life and so I'm not looking for any ways out. d wants to come home from uni next weekend for d's birthday, and I really don't agree but it seems she's coming anyway. However her and I having had the vaccine doesn't have any bearing on the decision.

Compared to the UK maybe? If you don't feel like thinking/writing about it, just ignore this question haha, it's purely out of curiosity! Answer: I find it very interesting but I just have more questions and no answers. I'm really curious for example as to why Germany has such a low mortality rate compared to the UK when I believe our healthcare systems are pretty similar. Is it an actual physical reality or is it to do with different representations of the numbers/ proportions of testing etc. I'm interested to watch Sweden and see their numbers given that they held firm against a lockdown at the point where the UK changed strategy. (Although I think we'd have had an even bigger disaster in the UK if we hadn't imposed a lockdown - and why hasn't that happened in Sweden?)Are there different mutations of the virus that have reached different countries, causing some to have higher mortality rates than others?How do genetics and population demographics impact on the death rate? Given that it's quite clear that having a higher BMI is a big independent risk factor for a poor outcome, how does that impact on the HAES movement? Why does smoking seem to be a protective factor and is this why some countries with higher proportions of smokers have lower mortality rates? What is really going on in many countries around the world whose data is suspect? And so on and so on.

Doc ID: 14533, distribution: 0.2920822914593777 ; I've been volunteering at the vaccine hub again this afternoon. It was crazy busy because we were doing two days worth of vaccines in one day. We got told last week a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was arriving on Tuesday and then later that a batch of Pfizer was arriving on Wednesday. The Pfizer has to be used in three days, so we had to do ALL the AstraZeneca today.  doses. We had to open a waiting room for the waiting room, because even with the best will in the world,  vaccinators cannot get ahead with those numbers. Every time one vaccinator table paused to draw up more vaccines, or to give a little extra time to someone who needed it, the queue built up.  I did a  hour shift and walked  steps. “Next please! Hi there…. come through…. follow me…. just take a seat right here” *big smile behind mask so that it spreads to my eyes and they can see it* Return to the door. Repeat. I think I might be doing it in my sleep. I'm back there again on Friday. I think today it was the + age group as well as healthcare workers.

Answer: The point of isolation is to a) protect the vulnerable and b) *slow down* the rate of the general population catching it, so that our health services it is a process that doesn't really have a clear end date for exactly the reason you said. It's why the UK government have held out for a while, because if you quarantine everyone so efficiently that no one catches it, you just have a very vulnerable population when you let them out of quarantine.

Doc ID: 16008, distribution: 0.29016052299533907 ; I read a lot of posts about people worrying over catching coronavirus and how to prevent it. Guys, most of us are going to catch it no matter what we do. At least % at a conservative estimate. The social distancing, self isolating etc is not to stop us catching it but just to delay it, slow the rate of new cases and flatten 'the peak' so that our various health services can cope with the numbers of seriously ill cases needing hospital care at any one point in time. For most of us who are under  and healthy, we are going to catch it, recover and then likely be immune and be able to get out there and be useful as we will no longer transmit it.  Keep washing your hands and following the advice given, but understand that none of it will guarantee to prevent you catching coronavirus sooner or later. Plus if you don't catch it this year, you'll probably get it next winter when its likely to come back.

Can you tell us more about the trial such as how you found out about it, how many people are in it, what you have to do, and more? Answer: Yes I'm involved in the Oxford vaccine trial. There were adverts out earlier in the year looking to recruit volunteers, that's how I found out about it, and I thought I could do my bit to try and help save the world - we don't get many chances to make a big difference like that. There's some thousands of people involved in it, in multiple countries. I've had a vaccine (and a second vaccine dose) which could be the COVID one or it could be a meningitis one (which they used as a control). I have to go back every few months for blood tests, and I have to do a COVID swab every week for the duration of the trial, which I think is a year. That's about it.

The government is emphasising (as cases rise) that just because we are allowed doesn't mean we should.  We have decided in discussion with my parents and my sister, that we will travel up and visit them for the five days. I don't think they have worried over it half as much as I have. I wish they would express a bit more concern although they have had lower cases than we have so I think maybe it doesn't seem such an immediate worry. Anyway, we are going to isolate from Friday (tomorrow in fact) so we should have four clear days before we travel. Then we'll travel without stopping on the way. That's the best we can do. Once there we will just be in our bubble and won't go anywhere or see anyone else. H and I are practically self isolating anyway, we are very diligent at following the rules. The girls have been in school but today was their last day so all that contact stops from now. Of course that is all dependant on Boris not changing the rules over the next week which I would not be surprised if he did if cases keep on rising. Holding everything lightly.

Ive had trichotillomania for years and Ive been trying extra hard to overcome it and my long hair was proof of me winning that fight.Tonight I grabbed some scissors and chopped it off. Not because I was pulling it out, more so for convenience. It was boring to me. It shed. I had to braid it when going to work to prevent my hair falling into the artwork. Im over the pippy long stocking look. Hell to brush and always dry and dead. But i was really proud of myself for being able to grow it out so long for once in my life. I cant believe i accomplished that!! But Im over it and Im compulsive. So I cut that shit off.Then I had some frozen burritos because its easy and now Im going to enjoy some tunes while I clean.

Ok so huge disclaimer: body hair is normal and it is your choice as to whether you remove it, leave it, wax it, plait it or laser it (etc 😉). Personally, I've just grown up preferring to remove it but as I said, that decision is not down to society. It's YOUR BODY!!!

But it's bearable and just feels like skin pricks. () There is no risk of skin cancer and some short side effects just include a rash or itchiness (but I didn't get anything at all 🙌🏻) () I'm having eight sessions and five areas done in total . . . the tmi info explained on YouTube 😅

(i'm being hopeful here 😅). i didn't think such a low effort, seemingly thoughtless task would mean much to me. but when i sat in that chair and watched old parts of me fall away, i felt lighter. .
.

i've been afraid to cut my hair because for the last couple of months i've only known myself with long hair. my hair was a comfort zone, and each inch the hairdresser cut off felt like a step  away from that safe space. i know this all seems ~terribly dramatic~, but i cant help but feel refreshed after my haircut. it was a little wake up call to let go of what ive been holding onto just because im scared to see it go, not because it's serving me. .
.

i officially have less hair, but now i have more ambition toward navigating life with this lifted weight (in a literal sense as well...my hair is thickkkkk). what's weighing you down? let that ish gooooooooo 👏🏼 happy weekend babes! ▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️

Doc ID: 7922, distribution: 1.0 ; i've never had good skin.
.
during my eating disorder,  my skin took an alarming hit. terribly dehydrated because i was afraid to drink water. pale and gray because i robbed my body of the nutrients it desperately needed.
.
during this time i also developed a rigorous case of anxiety. i was constantly paranoid, and to cope i would mindlessly pick at my skin. it was pain i could control...to mask the pain i couldn't. .
.
so now we have dry, pale, blistered and red skin.
.
even in good health, my skin has continued to be an issue. it seems like no matter what i do i'm constantly red, dry…something.
.
and then, it happened. my solution fell into my lap (mailbox).
.
last month my generous friend @daninemeh sent me some goodies. in the package she included the chlorophyll face mask by @cocokindskincare. i had never used anything from this brand but decided to try it out.
.
not to be dramatic, but this mask changed my life. it's super delicate so i use it every night (or in the morning if i have time)! after about  weeks of using, i saw tremendous changes in my skin. it was glowing, it was clear…and it was staying this way. coco, thank you for your magic!
.
this is in no way sponsored by any brand mentioned below. i've just gotten a lot of interest in my skin routine and this has been such a pivotal component for me!
.
to give a quick run down of my routine and other products...
- i was my face with @cerave skin renewing facial cleanser right when i wake up
- after wearing makeup for the day, i use a makeup wipe to remove it. then i wash my face again with this wash, and then use the @cerave hydrating micellar water to really make sure its all gone. then i use the cocokind mask!
- after i wash off the mask i use the cerave skin renewing night cream
.
as far as daily makeup goes, i usually wear a light base of foundation, some blush, and just curl my eyelashes. mascara if i HAVE to, but i hate taking that ish off 😪 i also drink a ton of water and that has helped! i have a @healthyhumanlife  oz water bottle that i refill -x a day! if you have any questions drop them below babies 💫

Doc ID: 7341, distribution: 1.0 ; these past few months in quarantine have been hard, but this time has done wonders for my skin. i haven't worn makeup (save for graduation pics 🤪) since the end of february. INSANE. aside from giving my skin this necessary breather, i've also had more time to try out new-to-me products and routines that i've found to yield results. i've never had great skin. i went through hell and back with my hormones because of my eating disorder, and this translated to skin issues for years. below i'm sharing my favorite products that have helped me improve and maintain my skin health!
▪️▪️▪️
. having a morning skin routine has done wonders for me! every morning i wash my face with @bewellcompanyskincare lavender & myrrh cleansing oil. every two or three days ill follow up with the avocado& sea moss exfoliator as well. then i pat my face dry and spritz with the probiotic rose toner. finish with a thick coating of the rose nourishing face cream. this is the ONLY lotion that has helped hydrate my extremely dry skin.
. i use a face mask every day. this sounds excessive, but the ones i cycle through are gentle enough for daily use. my favorites are the smoothie face masks from be well, the turmeric facial scrub from @yellowbeauty , and the manuka chai mask from @_afreshpurefood x @wholemaker.co. all three masks have helped immensely in evening skin tone and reducing redness (my biggest issue)! i activate all three of these with @bewellcompanyskincare hydrosols in place of water.
. i recently started using vitamin c serum to help with hyperpigmentation/dark spots. i mix two-three drops in with my moisturizer and love how it leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth. brand im using is @dear_klairs 
. i have a discount code for @bewellcompanyskincare (HEALTHFULRADIANCE). use it for % off your next order!

i hope some of this was helpful! above everything, i think the best thing for my skin has been simply leaving it alone. i used to pick at my face a lot, a nervous habit. resisting this urge and channeling this need into other activities has helped my skin immensely. paired with these products, i've found a routine im happy with! lmk your fave tips and tricks below ✌🏼

I've done so much data analysis recently I couldn't not blend it into this caption (sorry)!!! But I'm sure it's not just me that's noticed how much I've been keeping my hair in a bun recently? 😅

However, the poof still exists, do not worry. I took it down to assess the length and it has definitely grown since my lockdown . haircut. I think this is an optimal length right here, although I still can't get it all up in a bun without stragglers falling down at the back. Kirby grips will always be my saviour (btw does anyone else actually call them this, or is 'bobby pin' the more usual name? 😅)

-
Now when I say my hair has been on a journey, wowwww you guys it seriously has!!! For the majority of my life I've scraped my hair back into a tight bun on the top of my head: the classic Holly bun 😏 Don't get me wrong, she reappears from time to time, but I've been following the Curly Girl Method pretty religiously for just over half a year now and it has transformed the health of my hair, literally 🙌🏻
-
So here's what I do currently and some of my best advice:
-
🌼 Brushing my hair dry is a massive no no!!! I only use a wide toothed comb in the shower and sometimes a @denmanbrush just before I add gel. I'm also not applying any heat to my hair at all, so no straightening or use of a hair dryer!
-
🌼 In Thailand I was using the new Curly Girl approved shampoo and conditioner bars from @ethiqueworld. Ngl I'm still getting used to the bars, but I will be using them permanently going forwards because they are pretty much zero waste and therefore a lot better than buying haircare products in bottles! 🌎
-
🌼 As I'm swimming at the moment, I wash my hair more frequently than I'm used to doing 🙈 I wear a swimming cap (we love the look and ofc with the goggles too 😏) and so I always wash my hair after this or I just rinse it really well when I'm pushed for time lol. This tends to be two or three times a week.
-
🌼 Every time my hair gets wet after my shower I'll style it with my gel from @sogooditsnoughty using the rake and scrunch method 👌🏻 I then plop for  hour using a big t-shirt and sleep with this t-shirt then covering my pillow to reduce frizz. On all other nights we're wearing the silk bonnet 😉
-
Going forwards, I want to try some different styling gels . . . or maybe an oil if that also works? So if you have any recommendations then please do share down below 🥰 My new haircare routine is obviously a big step-up from what I did before with my hair (basically nothing 😅) and it takes a bit more time, but it's part of my life now and I am honestly in love with my new found curls 💚

If you saw my original hair transformation video back in November last year, then you'll know I've been following the Curly Girl Method since then! Some basics rules are as follows: () Don't brush your hair when it's dry () No heat is allowed () Avoid using towels as they'll encourage frizz () Most products you use (with one exception below) should be free from silicones, sulphates and other harsh chemicals 💆🏻‍♀️
-
I am by no means an expert on all things hair care, but below is everything I do as well as the products mentioned, which are all vegan and cruelty-free✌🏻🌍
-
In the shower: () A 'reset' wash is needed if you've used products that are not Curly Girl approved, and this is when you use a shampoo *with* silicones. I use this anti-dandruff one from Tesco, which is really really cheap!!! () If I'm not doing a reset wash I just use my @functionofbeauty shampoo () To condition, I use the one by @sogooditsnoughty and de-tangle with my wide-tooth comb 🚿
-
Post-shower: () It's important to keep your hair really wet here, so I always use a spray bottle () My leave-in conditioner is from @functionofbeauty () For styling, I use the jelly (and I use a lot!) by @sogooditsnoughty with the rake and scrunch method to encourage curls () I plop for anywhere between  minutes to one hour with a t-shirt and then leave it to air-dry 🌬
-
Final step, when you hair is *completely* dry: To remove the gel cast you need to 'scrunch out the crunch'. I normally use a t-shirt, again to minimise frizz, but you can also use your hands!
-
Yes, this routine is pretty high maintenance, but I only wash my hair every  days or so (shock horror, I know, but I'm a very dry human and over-washing your hair isn't great 😅). I can also just reset my curls without washing by simply spraying it down with water, adding gel and following the steps onwards 🙌🏻

Happy weekend my friends, and I hope this is useful for anyone looking to try the Curly Girl Method 💚🎀

Do I regret cutting my own hair? Well, my initial thoughts are to say, yes . . . I didn't want it to end up this short again, because I think I preferred it a tad longer when I could still tie it up easily without having to use a band to keep it all off my face. My one-cut job also meant that it had to be feathered at the front when my dude fixed it.
-
H O W E V E R. I really dislike the thought of living with regrets. It's just not worth it. I don't know why I decided to pick up a pair of scissors and chop off my hair that day, but I did, and I can't change it. Hair grows, get over it Holly. I'm still not quite sure why Dad won't let me cut his (🤔😂), but perhaps I'll stick to cutting mangoes instead. I think I'm better at that 🙃
-
I suppose what I've learnt from this experience most of all is to not be afraid to take a bit of a risk (and I'm trying to apply this to what I'm doing next in life 😬)?! I mean, taking risks can be super fun, and most of the time, if things go wrong you can always fix it (or get someone to help you 😉).

Doc ID: 24430, distribution: 0.011482550132759872 ; Question: I'm sorry if this is weird but i was creeping your insta and I watched your story I was jusy wondering how you got backstage for marshmello??? Answer:  lol i dont go out anymore unless im backstage. festivals and events r overstimulating n too wild for me these days bc ive had a lot of bad experiences (multiple physical assaults) and my bf/friends are talented ppl who either make music or make content for people who make music so i get to sit backstage where its calm so i can still enjoy going out but not get harassed. if i could handle being one with the crowd, i would, but that energy is just too intense for me. its hard enough for me just getting stage to stage if im not taking the backstage trails, so many people and bodies to avoid walking into, so many things going on, so many emotions, so many voices, etc. it makes me lose my mind, i cant focus on having fun if im too focused on the thousands of ppl surrounding me and wondering whether or not one of them is going to attack me for no reason bc it wouldnt be the first time. i literally attract crazies and aggressive ppl. thats not me manifesting, thats litetally just my reality lol. im very fortunate to have the ppl in my life that i do, bc of them i still get to have fun sometimes, bc their priveledge is my priveledge. but yea believe me if i could jsut be a normal ass attendee again with no worries or cares id LOvE that, but that aint my life haha. it aint that glamorous i promise. im only backstage bc im neurotic n know the right ppl. the main benefit is the free yerba mates. fuckin love guayaki. oh and the air conditioned potty trailers those are very very nice

Doc ID: 2893, distribution: 0.010434723615814955 ; A little story about how my life has changed in  years - At , I was working around  hours a week at a job that wasn't fulfilling, I had no car or licence, I had such low self-esteem that I never left the house, and I had such huge goals but no direction, all because I was so afraid of failure I didn't push myself to do these things. So in short, I wasn't happy. Later that year I met Dylan. He's been my inspiration to BE MORE and do more with my life. I'm  now and since knowing him, I have saved up and bought my first car outright, pursued my singing (on YouTube), my radio career (I'm now working full time in radio as the Promotions Coordinator and an On Air personality), my writing (I've just released my st book), I've learned to save all of my money, and finally I understand that none of us truly know what will happen in the coming years, but I'm happy I now have a plan, one that Dylan and I can share together, and it's a pretty dang beautiful one! I thank my lucky stars every day to have someone like him in my life! ✨ We're so lucky to be born, healthy and capable of taking on the world. Sometimes we just need something to nudge us on our way. 🦋

Doc ID: 14672, distribution: 0.16487782240256846 ; Question: How would you react if someone from the United States suddenly became one of your neighbors? Answer: I'd welcome them! Just like I would anyone else. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14487, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: wait where are the mailboxes??  Answer: We don't have separate outside mailboxes in the UK. We have a letterbox on the door and the post drops straight into the house 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14496, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: It's important to note the uk has way less surface area than the us. Houses have to be close and yep we tend to build up and not out because there isn't loads of space especially in towns and cities. Loft conversions get you a whole extra floor of space! Also a lot of our housing stock is old eg Victorian terraces which were built for factory workers before people had a lot of choice about where they lived and no way to demand bigger/better housing. It's not worth knocking down massive portions of towns or cities so we just improve it as best we can  Answer: Thanks anon! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14511, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Are you able to share how you and your neighbors have attached houses? Answer: I'm guessing you're not from the UK 😊 Semi-detached houses are a very standard way of housing here. Houses are in pairs all down the street. Here's an example image from google (not my house) that's an example. On my road we don't have drives or garages, so we just have to park on the road outside the house. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14509, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: so thats not one big house its two? does that mean uk houses are like tall and not wide?  Answer: Yes that's two houses. I think on average, UK houses are just smaller than US houses. Our house was originally two floors, that's pretty typical for an average UK house, but we had a loft conversion so now it's got three floors but it still looks like the one in the picture from the front. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14497, distribution: 0.13353538968413825 ; Question: Do you know your neighbours? I live in a complex in Canada but don't know my neighbours at all! Answer: Yes we know our neighbours quite well. We have a couple of WhatsApp groups, one for just our closest-friend neighbours ( other houses) and one for the whole street ( houses but they're not all in it). The whole street one is useful for community messages, such as someone's cat going missing, information about roadworks, Clap for Carers last year, or socially distanced doorstep carol singing at Christmas. It helps me match people's names to house numbers but I still don't know who is who if I pass them on the pavement though! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14508, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Blow their minds, tell them about terraces!!! Answer: I give you….Terraced houses. Joined together on both sides!! This is the true classic UK housing “two up two down” ie two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs.  (Btw you can spot the individual houses here by the front doors)Some terraced houses are actually quite big though - I lived in one as a student that had five bedrooms over three floors 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14663, distribution: 0.07193925595102907 ; We got rid of our second car last week. It failed its MOT, which was really the trigger, but we have been saying to ourselves for months now that while H is working from home, we do not need two cars. Even when he goes back to the office, I imagine there will be much less travelling around now everyone has discovered the wonders of zoom so I'm hopeful we'll be able to get by on one car. Parking is really tight on our street (it's all on-road parking and many houses have two cars so there just isn't space for them all) and caused me a lot of anxiety so now I feel very smug that we just have one car and it's sitting in a space outside our own house. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14488, distribution: 0.7210151620598223 ; Question: are bungalows flats? and are bungalows and flats like our apartments or studios?  Answer: Left: bungalow (one storey house)Right: flats (several storeys but each floor is one home)I don't know the difference between an apartment and a studio. Apartments in the UK is basically another word for upmarket flats. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14495, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Also! The same street can have LOADS of different house types because they've developed organically over time not been built as one entity. My road has ish houses and we have a few different styles terraces, a few detached, some semis, a small block of flats, etc. All look completely different  Answer: Yep. My road is terraces for the first half of the street, then semis for the second half and at the end are a couple of small blocks of flats. The problem my road has is there's not enough parking as so many houses have two cars, but there's only space for about . cars to park on the road outside each house. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14498, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Where are houses attached to each other in the UK? In my experience in my metropolitan area, duplexes are common for older individuals who don't feel comfortable living in regular sized houses (or want a smaller space), people who have disabilities, and families with young children. Answer: We call them semi-detached (or terraced) and they're just all over the place. A really standard way to live.When people want a smaller space, they may downsize to a bungalow - that only has a ground floor and no stairs. Ironically, bungalows are generally detached because they're often newer one-off builds built by people on spare bits of land. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14507, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: We do have semi-attached homes in the US called duplexes, but they're not terribly common and typically in lower income areas (in my experience at least). They are typically rentals as well, owned by one landlord and rented out to two people. How do you go about making shared repairs on the house with your neighbor (for example the roof)? Also what is a loft conversion? Answer: Each house is just responsible for their bit, so if our roof needed repairing we'd just do our side. If it affects both houses, we'd have to negotiate with our neighbours what to do, but usually we just take care of our own side.A loft conversion is when the top space of the house under the roof is converted from a dusty random space (often with a trapdoor for access and maybe used for storage) into usable rooms. We have a big bedroom and an en suite bathroom up here and it's lovely. It's generally cheaper than moving to a bigger house to get more space. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16973, distribution: 1.0 ; The house next to us is for sale and there's lots of viewings today. Parking is really difficult on our road so we want some people without a car to move in. We're being very nosey checking out all our potential new neighbours. H came home and I fake-shouted at him on the doorstep for taking my parking space 😂 in the hope of putting off the car owners. To be honest, if we could think of a way to join their house to our house, we'd seriously consider buying it. But we are one side of a semi and they are the near side of the next door semi, so short of a first floor sky bridge it doesn't seem very possible. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14484, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Aaaand - because I'm loving this cross-cultural sharing: In the UK we use the term duplex for a flat (apartment) that includes two floors of accommodation, joined by an internal staircase. And three floors (uncommon) can be referred to as a triplex. And there's also maisonettes... Answer: This is getting into the realms of specialist housing blogs now. No more!!
