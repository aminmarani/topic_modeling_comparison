Topic 1 : 
top terms: baby, school, inpatient, run, hope, family, babies, hospital, friends, lovely
Doc ID: 21726, distribution: 0.8957811922248239 ; Question: What happens during family meetings?  Answer: It depends on the family meeting! Each meeting will have a topic it focuses on. For example, this particular meeting was about discharge planning and the transition back to school. The meeting is usually run by the psychiatrist and the social worker with lots of input and guidance from the patient. Every family will be different and the structure of the meeting may vary from meeting to meeting. Let me know if you have any other questions! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14507, distribution: 0.871228742570302 ; Question: We do have semi-attached homes in the US called duplexes, but they're not terribly common and typically in lower income areas (in my experience at least). They are typically rentals as well, owned by one landlord and rented out to two people. How do you go about making shared repairs on the house with your neighbor (for example the roof)? Also what is a loft conversion? Answer: Each house is just responsible for their bit, so if our roof needed repairing we'd just do our side. If it affects both houses, we'd have to negotiate with our neighbours what to do, but usually we just take care of our own side.A loft conversion is when the top space of the house under the roof is converted from a dusty random space (often with a trapdoor for access and maybe used for storage) into usable rooms. We have a big bedroom and an en suite bathroom up here and it's lovely. It's generally cheaper than moving to a bigger house to get more space. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16034, distribution: 0.8662632851245022 ; Question: why does baby get contact with mom if shes in foster care? is it only for babies or for older foster kids too?  Answer: All children have the right to a family life through the Human Rights Act. This means even if they are brought into foster care, they have the legal right to continue to have a relationship with their birth family unless or until there is good reason to stop this. This applies to all children of all ages. When children have arranged contact with their birth family, this right to family life is protected (even though arranged contact may not be what everyone views as 'family life').Baby will continue to have supervised contact with her birth mum until a ruling is made by the court abut her future. Imagine if there was no contact, and then the court found six months later (the standard minimum length of family court proceedings in the UK) that mum was able to safely parent her baby. By then mum and baby wouldn't have seen each other for  months and the relationship would have been severely damaged. Contact can also form a very useful part of the parenting assessment, which contributes to the court's final decision.Newborn babies typically have relatively large amounts of contact with their birth parents -  hours, three or four times a week. This helps preserve their relationship in the critical early months of life until a court ruling has been made. Older children in care of the local authority have varying amounts of contact depending on the circumstances, but very rarely as frequent as newborns. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 17221, distribution: 0.8617059501513606 ; Question: Do you get paid to foster children? If so, how much? Answer: Yes but only when you have a child in placement. Which is unpredictable. So it's a terrible career if it's your only source of income. We get paid a salary for fostering and then we get paid an allowance for the child to buy everything they need. For babies, it's pretty generous and easily covers things, but for older children it often doesn't. Also we don't pay any tax on any of that income due to government tax relief. Typical foster carer income is £-£ a week but varies with agency, experience, type and age of foster placement, and additional things you do for your agency or service. It's not a job you could or should do just for the money though. You need to be primarily motivated by improving life for the children in your care. No amount of money would make the demands and emotional rollercoaster of fostering worth it if you didn't find it intrinsically rewarding. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15020, distribution: 0.8567804085665709 ; Question: Who is H? How many babies have you fostered? Could you ever adopt any of them? Answer: H is my husband (H for husband!) We've fostered  babies and no we haven't ever had the option to adopt any of them. Fostering babies in the UK doesn't generally lead into adoption by the fostering family. The usual outcome is either reunification with birth family or adoption by adopters who are already assessed and waiting. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.8469096449171926 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

Doc ID: 14509, distribution: 0.8328238512008107 ; Question: so thats not one big house its two? does that mean uk houses are like tall and not wide?  Answer: Yes that's two houses. I think on average, UK houses are just smaller than US houses. Our house was originally two floors, that's pretty typical for an average UK house, but we had a loft conversion so now it's got three floors but it still looks like the one in the picture from the front. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14416, distribution: 0.8320228245401128 ; Question: Who has been vaccinated in the UK? Answer: About a third of the adult population.Everyone over  has been called for a vaccine, and this week age group - years old can book their vaccines.In addition all frontline health care and social care workers have been invited for a vaccine, as well as those with underlying health conditions. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14743, distribution: 0.826740474050669 ; Question: How often do you see the babies after they are placed? How old are they typically? How old is the baby you just had? Answer: There's three scheduled visits after they're placed. We usually have babies placed with us when they're just a few days old, so they're typically between  months and a year old when they leave us. That was the case for this baby too. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15319, distribution: 0.8254592472269164 ; Question: How long are the babies allowed to stay with you? Can you only have babies stay with you? Answer: We only take babies because our only spare room has a cot in it and it's not big enough for a single bed. The babies stay with us until the court process has been completed and they either return to their birth parents or they move to an adoptive family. That's usually between  months and a year. About  years ago, the UK government set a  week target from the initial care order to the final court order, and although extensions often have to be applied for, that has speeded the whole process up. The first couple of babies we fostered we had for nearer  years each, and that is a long time for a baby to be in temporary foster care rather than with their forever family, bonding and attaching.

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

-  cup almond flour
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

mix until a thick, sticky dough forms. fold through chocolate chips of choice, then cover bowl and place in fridge for  minutes.

meanwhile, in a food processor add:

- / cup almond butter
- / cup soft pitted dates
- pinch of sea salt

run the blender. after a few seconds, slowly pour in a tablespoon of warm water and let it run through the mixture. add one more if the blade isn't moving much! the mix here should be sticky and rollable, not watery.

add the almond butter/date mixture to the dough, the mix thoroughly with hands until sticky and well combined. if the batter is a dit dry, feel free to add up to  tbsp dairy free milk. stir through chocolate chips at this point as well! transfer dough to the loaf pan and press down until even. bake for about  minutes, then let cool completely before slicing

Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 0.9724508414058952 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 14353, distribution: 0.9697674415305265 ; Therapy .. // reading between the lines  When we had finally got the internet issues resolved and we had a stable zoom connection, I sat there looking at T and feeling completely derailed after all the upheaval. “I feel all over the place now” I wailed, waving my hands in the air. T said yes she did too and she asked me if I'd like her to pray. This isn't something she usually does but it felt right in this situation. She prayed and I felt calmed and soothed and like we were centred and back together in the 'room'. So then I tried to get started. I said to T “Do you remember last session that I ran out of time to say something at the end?” and when she nodded I carried on “That was about something you said the session before… when you said you would always be honest and real with me.” T said she remembered that. I said that I had felt quite emotional when she said it. We dug down a little to find out what kind of emotion it was, and eventually I said that it was relief. That if I knew she was going to be straight up with me, then I no longer had to worry about reading between the lines of what she might be saying but not saying. I spent all my childhood reading between the lines of what my parents were saying, and it's hard work to always be hypervigilant for what's actually happening - or what you imagine is actually happening. The two things play into each other, when you're hypervigilant and highly sensitive, you can create whole scenarios that may or may not be based in reality. I don't know how much of that is me reading things between the lines that weren't there and getting upset about imagined scenarios that weren't actually reality, and how much is me genuinely picking up on things that were going on below the surface. I suppose that's something I have to be ok with not knowing because there's no way of going back in time with adult eyes to find out. I said to T that I needed her to know that if she says that she will be honest and real and I don't need to read between the lines, then I won't. And so if she wants me to know something, she needs to tell it to me straight up and not expect me to figure it out from what she's said. I said “so if we have a rupture and I get all stressed about something I've thought you've implied, then I'm going to try and soothe myself by reminding myself that you didn't actually say the words that my brain is creating from what you did say. So I need you to not get frustrated with me for not picking up on what you might have meant but not said.” It took ages for me to make clear to T what I was trying to say. I nearly gave up a few times and trailed off talking. She said “Am I not really getting you right now?” and I said “no, not really”. T encouraged me to stick with it and keep trying to explain it, and she did eventually get it and summarise it beautifully in a couple of sentences. When she did that, I immediately relaxed and smiled and nodded that she'd got it bang on. T said that was fine and she would continue to try her best to be be honest and real with me and she wouldn't expect me to pick up things she hadn't actually said. She reminded me that I can always check things out in session, if she's said something and I wonder if she's implying something else. I will try and do that, although often I don't process what she's said till after the session. I too quickly get caught up in session with “oh she must be meaning this” and then I tend to close it down with shame because my brain always translates it that she's trying to tell me I'm not good enough in some way. So that's something to watch out for in future sessions and also to try and spot when it happens to me in conversations with other people outside of therapy.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9690958931501941 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.9669462304548642 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15251, distribution: 0.9664375854230745 ; Therapy .. // 👍  T's very first words after we'd logged in this session were “So, how were the A-level results?” She caught me by surprise a bit as I had intended to start by talking about her reply to my text, and instead I found myself answering her question. She followed it up with a couple of other questions, and then she asked me how I was after last session. She isn't usually as directive as this, with question after question. If I didn't have my stuff to talk about, I would be loving it.  I ignored her last question and said “Can I talk about something else first instead?” She said “Yes of course…. I just have a note in my diary that we would talk about endings this session, so I wanted to sort of tie up the loose ends from the last week first.” I nodded because I hadn't forgotten about the dreaded 'endings' talk, but I can't talk about anything more until I've got this said. I started, “I sent you that text about d's A-level results -“ T interrupted “Did you?”. She sounded surprised. “I don't think I got it” “Yes you did! You replied!” T scrolled through her phone. “Oh yes! So I did” “Uh, so, I didn't really like the thumbs up emoji for a reply. It felt like a brush off. Like I could have text you saying I was about to jump off a bridge, and you'd still have sent me a thumbs up.” T smiled “Yes, I see your point. I'm sorry… I think I was… let me see, what day was it… Thursday… oh yes I was busy doing my course and I didn't really register what was going on with the A level results till much later on” “Yeah… I think I just wished I'd not sent the text at all. I mean, I knew we were on a break so I wasn't expecting a big conversation. I just thought you might be wondering… you know, because we'd talked about d getting her results… so I wanted to tell you.” “Yes I understand, I'm sorry. I get things wrong sometimes…. It's actually important that I do, that I'm not perfect, because that helps you learn that we can make mistakes and we can recover from them, our relationship can recover. And I can't deliberately make mistakes! So that learning has to happen as an experiential thing, it happens organically in the therapy process and that's when we can look at it and deal with it.” And that was that. The conversation felt done. I think it gets easier to cope with these ruptures and repairs each time one happens. A few years ago, it would have taken me the whole session to manage to say what I was upset about. It really would. It would have completely sent me out of my window of tolerance, my anxiety over telling T how I felt would have been paralysing. I can take comfort from seeing how I've grown, and even though it still means uncomfortable situations, I can face the discomfort and disaster does not occur.

Doc ID: 14454, distribution: 0.9634627453148802 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week's been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I'd been holding all week… and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right??

Doc ID: 14442, distribution: 0.9609183495743564 ; Therapy .. // is this part ? I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. “When you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.” T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. “You look like you're about to say something” T commented. “I'm deliberating whether to say it or not” I said, pulling a face. “Go on then, let's just say it”  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said “ok, sooo… it was a blip”. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it.

Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.9608640413872537 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 0.9604035463534412 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said “”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.” I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

Doc ID: 15572, distribution: 0.9595401934441006 ; Therapy .. // emotional intelligence  After we'd talked about retraining my brain for  minutes (instead of the  minutes I'd planned!), there was only time to bring up one of my two remaining topics. I pushed “faulty thought patterns” on to next week - it's been pushed on so many times now anyway. And part of me doesn't want to jump into it at all anyway. I explained how I'd been thinking about therapy from the week before and it suddenly occurred to me how differently my mum and I see my children's relationship with my dad. My mum pushes them towards him, whereas I try and keep them away from him. My mum seems to think that she can create a relationship by pushing them into proximity with each other, whereas I am trying to prevent their relationship being destroyed, by keeping them away from each other. Not only that, but I feel physically very anxious when any of my girls are one on one with my dad. It's more a trigger from my own childhood but some of it is also based in current reality. Sometimes I even have to leave the room because it stirs up so much anxiety in me that I can't bear to sit there and watch it play out.  My mum is oblivious to how much anxiety my dad generates in me. T said “Your parents aren't emotionally intelligent. They couldn't or wouldn't understand how you felt as a child. They couldn't imagine what was going on inside you. But you are emotionally intelligent. You are doing things differently. You think about how your girls are feeling and you respond to that.” I usually agree with my mum on everything so it's strange to think about this stark difference in how we behave. I said “It's hard to think of my mum as having got something wrong” “But Faith, you do know she got things wrong, because you have chosen to be intentional about parenting differently. We've spoken about that.” I sighed and nodded. T is right. It's just uncomfortable to have to face it again.

 (tw ED, self harm) I have been confronted this past week with the sound of my mother tongues: the languages of fear and shame, words that were spoken to me when I was young, languages that are more familiar to me than my own heartbeat. When I hear them, I speak them back in razor blades to my skin, bruised eyes and an empty belly. Shame and fear are body-languages, felt in hunched shoulders and downcast eyes, and spoken through scarred arms and bony-framed bodies leaning over toilet bowls. They are asking of me the impossible: to learn a new way of communication, to begin to hear and speak differently. To unlearn the body-languages, to recognize the messages of the past, hear their sound, but respond back with my own true voice. They are asking me to verbalize my experience rather than expressing my pain and grief through my physical self. But my own true voice feels unfamiliar and strange, my words foreign on my tongue; self-denial and self-destruction taste like home. To speak with actual words, to vocalize my pain, is to make it real. And to make it real is to feel it and to feel it is to hurt and good god, I do not want to hurt. But I am still hearing my native tongues despite it all, the voices of of shame and obsessive fear and always-and-forever-alone-ness rising above the fray. They rattle through my bones, shaking me to my core, and everything in me wants to speak them back, respond to the heaviness they bring by pouring out my pain in prolonged hunger and sharp objects on my skin. Yes, I am being asked to do the impossible: to do something different. I have been speaking, but I have been speaking in the Old Languages, Their languages, living into the messages they gave me (dirty:unworthy:broken:never enough) by destroying my very flesh and bone. They pronounced destruction over me and I now I speak it over myself, a woman fluent in tearing herself to shreds. The question is not why I self-destruct. I know that answer all too well. The question is: how in the world do I stop? How do I stop listening so intently to the words I know by heart, those of age-old, haunting shame and paralyzing fear / how do I stop speaking the Old Languages, communicating to the world only through my body? The poet Marge Piercy writes:  She must learn again to speak
starting with I
starting with We
starting as the infant does
with her own true hunger
and pleasure 
and rage. I suppose that's where I must start too, with my own true hunger and pleasure and rage, things I've long suppressed. I suppose this is the only way to learn a language, to fumble through and stumble along like a child until one day it comes naturally, flowing off the tongue.  Here is to new ways of listening: tuning in to the voices of self-compassion and worthiness and grace; for something besides the Old Ways / those familiar sounds of shame and fear. Here is to new ways of speaking: articulating my pain and heartache and internal experience through my own true voice, however shaky and rusty it may be, instead of through these body-languages.

Doc ID: 12235, distribution: 0.8584009525442221 ; youmakesenseproject:  the world can feel overwhelming sometimes, particularly for people with a history of trauma. it can reinforce that sense of, “see? I was right to never let down my guard. something bad IS happening - I knew we weren't safe.”  PTSD tells us to always stay in a state of alertness, even when we are physically safe. we can never rest. but the truth is, staying hyper-vigilant doesn't actually protect us. it simply makes us *feel* less out of control.  but even in times of collective anxiety (ESPECIALLY in times of collective anxiety), we can learn to create internal safety for ourselves. we can begin to take our heightened systems down a few a notches, treating our anxiety with the care that we would a small child.  perhaps it's okay to set down your armor for a few moments, even if you pick it right back up after.  perhaps it's okay to feel a sense of safety and not be on rigid alert every second.

I don't give the trauma any credit in this; I refuse to romanticize my suffering. I am resilient, strong and kind because of the work I did in the aftermath - the healing I chose for myself. A lot of people only see the past trauma and who I am now, and miss the years in between of therapy and intense internal work done to get me to a point of being resilient, strong and kind. It was not an automatic result of having suffered, it was an intentional choice.

  I told a therapist once that I wished I could fix my broken brain and stop all the self-destructive noise, and responding by telling me that my brain is reacting exactly as it should be given my trauma history. I started crying because for so long I had thought that there was something wrong with me. I was always the sick one, the one who couldn't stop self-destructing, the one who was broken. Except I wasn't.  She told me that while it feels incredibly frustrating to deal with panic attacks or dissociation or flashbacks, and it gets incredibly tiring having to tell myself that yes, we are going to eat today, my brain is actually responding in a really healthy manner. It's simply trying to protect me post-trauma. My brain has always been trying to protect me, and that helps somehow on the hard days. It helps to know that despite my brain leaning towards maladaptive ways of survival, it is simply because it doesn't know that we're not in original circumstances anymore when that was needed to disconnect. It is still desperately trying to get me through the hard stuff.   I'm now learning how to orient myself to the present, to send signals to my system that we are safe now, and to teach my brain that it doesn't need to protect me in that same way anymore. But I'm also grateful - although that may sound strange - at how cool it is that my brain is THAT hard-wired to survive. It's kind of beautiful to think about actually, at least in the moments when my head is above water. So here's to not being angry at myself when a symptoms pops up that interferes with my life.

Doc ID: 12257, distribution: 0.808735203773814 ; Good takeaways from “Understanding the Paradox of Surviving Childhood Trauma” by Joanne Zucchetto (mostly aimed at clinicians, but good info nonetheless): • so much of this comes back to attachment - kids depend on their caregiver(s) to survive so their brain can't allow them to know the full extent of the harm and protects the attachment figure (to know the full extent of the harm & their powerlessness would mean annihilation) –> so they often disconnect from body / emotions to survive and use self-destructive behaviors to do so • self-destructive behaviors are the brain's way of forming a defense against the harm
 • to make meaning out of the harm, kids often blame themselves & take on their parents' badness (ie: if I'm bad, I did something wrong, therefore it makes more sense) 
 • instead of telling someone “No, you're good / not worthless / not to blame!” trying to understand how that defense has functioned to help them survive trauma

Doc ID: 9597, distribution: 0.9351541396405174 ; our relationships to our bodies can feel really complicated, and getting told to “just love it!” might seem pretty useless if that's just not something that feels possible in the moment.

just because you don't love your body doesn't mean you have to fight against it. here are things you can work on:

- choosing to accept your body no matter how it changes, fluctuates, or appears
- finding things to appreciate about your body like how much it allows you to do and how it's just trying to take care of you
- not giving the harmful thoughts the attention they want and not allowing them to control your actions
- questioning your harmful thoughts and asking yourself where they came from
- saying kind things to your body and repeating positive mantras that resonate with you
- taking care of your body and honoring your body's needs and desires even when you might not want to

hating your body doesn't do anything except make your body a harder place to exist in, so when “body love” feels out of reach, try body acceptance, body appreciation, body peace, body neutrality, body kindness, and body respect instead.

know that thinner does not mean healthier,

be actively learning about Health At Every Size,

understand that you deserve to live a life that is not focused around shrinking your body,

throw out your scale,

know that your worth does not lie in how you look,

and STILL want to lose weight.

the pressure to be thin in our society is very present and very real, and if you are struggling with tuning out the noise of diet culture, i see you. choosing to simply accept yourself and your body in a culture that tells you that you can always be doing and being “better” is hard!

tbh, i don't have the answers for how to just get over this challenge, but what i can remind you of is that facing your food fears, fighting against this oppressive society, and rebelliously choosing to embrace yourself exactly how you are made to be ARE SO ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.

disclaimer: it's okay if you are someone trying to lose weight, and i'm not judging you for it. this post is geared towards people who want to prioritize their health over their appearance and who want to change that their unhealthy relationship with their body.

Doc ID: 9550, distribution: 0.906306407230538 ; you don't need to justify your weight gain to anyone (including yourself), and the only thing weight gain really means is that you've gained weight. that's it.

weight gain doesn't mean you need to change how you eat.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less beautiful.

weight gain doesn't mean you've “lost yourself”.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less healthy.

weight gain doesn't mean you can't still rock your favorite outfit.

weight gain doesn't mean you should be less confident.

weight gain doesn't mean you're any less worthy.

weight gain doesn't mean ANYTHING about the wonderful human you are.

weight gain really doesn't have any inherent meaning, and it's important to remember that our bodies are MEANT to change throughout the course of our lives. even if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, your actions, how you feel, and your quality of life matter a whole lot more than your weight does.

recently, i've gained weight, and you know what? i'm cool with that. i know it can feel a lot easier to know and be told than to truly believe, but you deserve to love yourself and accept yourself no matter how your body changes.

your body is the vessel to your soul. it WILL change, but your worth never will.

Doc ID: 9725, distribution: 0.9009645553217273 ; there is no love or joy in hating yourself or your body.

self-compassion is hard. healing is hard. unlearning diet culture is hard. recovery is hard. seeing the bigger picture is hard. confronting your personal conscious and subconscious biases is hard. but, you can choose to make your next choice one that is aligned with your goal of freedom, choose to do the same with the choice after that, and then continue to make individual choices from now until forever that are aligned with how you want to live your life.

you may feel guilt or shame in the process, you may feel like you're doing it all wrong, you're not going to do things “perfectly” (whatever that means), and you may even give up at certain times, but you can still commit and re-commit to choosing the path that will help you reach your highest potential.

while achieving a healthy, respectful, and happy relationship with yourself, food, or your body isn't a fast or easy process, you deserve love, you deserve joy, and you are capable of achieving freedom.

IT. IS. WORTH. IT. i promise.

i'm not anti-weight loss or anti-people who want to change how they look, but i am anti-putting value in people's bodies and anti-the systems that oppress those that don't meet diet culture's standards for health and beauty.

if you want to lose weight for your “big day” or some other occasion, i'm not here to tear you down, but here are some reasons why it might be in your best interest to NOT try to lose weight for your wedding or any other special event:

- you might struggle to be present on the day of your event
- it could ruin the day of your event if you aren't at your goal weight
- you might not have the energy you want leading up to and on the day of your event
- the way you view and treat your body might affect the way the people around you view and treat their own
- it might make you miss out on fun experiences
- if you make your weight a top priority leading up to the event, then your weight will likely stay as a top priority after
- it could be detrimental to both your physical and mental health long-term.
- it might affect your relationship with your loved ones
- your memories of the day could be tainted

is the potential end goal of weight loss (which doesn't change your worth one bit) for one day (which you might not fully enjoy if you pursue that weight loss) really worth all of those likely consequences??

you are not a bad person if you want to lose weight, but the society that we live in that worships thinness is oppressive, makes a lot of people feel bad for NOT losing weight, and puts so much value in our bodies which really have nothing to do with our worth.

NO ONE deserves to feel morally obligated to change  their body or appearance for any reason, and we are ALL inherently and unconditionally worthy no matter what.

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.8937746348854847 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

Doc ID: 9501, distribution: 0.8673596901033263 ; the desire to lose weight and the fear of gaining weight are often symptoms of wanting to feel accepted, validated, desired, and loved.

challenging this belief isn't just about accepting weight gain, but about learning to care less about what other people might think and learning to cultivate self-acceptance, self-validation, self-empowerment, and self-love instead.

AND SO MANY MORE THINGS that have NOTHING to do with how my body looks.

growing up as an athlete, i LOVED moving my body and challenging my body to be stronger and faster and capable of doing things that made me feel really fulfilled. but, somewhere along the way, i picked up a lot of toxic diet culture messaging, and combined with developing an ED, my relationship with exercise got pretty messed up and confusing. i still enjoyed moving my body, but i also had become fixated on how my body looked and the impact exercising had on it. developing a healthy relationship with exercise took me a lot of years of trial and error, but i'm very happy and proud to say that my relationship with movement now is restored and better than ever!

reminders:

all movement is good movement.

when the pursuit of physical health prevents you from living fully in other areas of your life, it becomes unhealthy.

your eating and exercise habits are not your identity.

honoring your body can look like doing a workout even when it feels hard, AND it can look like cancelling it because it feels hard.

a rest day doesn't have to be an “active rest day”.

we could all eat and move the same way, and we would all still look completely different.

healthy behaviors are healthy regardless of weight changes or lack thereof.

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.9832695773748604 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they're human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure… 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their “best”
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying “You are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were” so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today 🦋

Happy Real Me Monday! 💐

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore.

I became conscious from an early age that my appearance & body was “important” & that if I didn't fit that mould of perfection, I would be judged, teased, considered unattractive & unworthy too.

It was only once I started questioning my body image & the conditioning I grew up with that I realised the state of my body image was up to me & I didn't actually agree with what I thought I believed all this time. 

That's why this weekly Real Me Monday series is here, to remind you that:
👀 most of us have been unintentionally conditioned with the unrealistic beauty standards we have today
🤳🏻 social media is a highlight reel
💡 the things you say about yourself aren't factual
🧠 you aren't your thoughts OR other people's opinions of you
😍 you can create your own body image, you don't have to hold onto the conditioned views you grew up with (easier said than done, but possible!!)

There comes a time when you've got to ask yourself, would you rather: A. Conform & be miserable on your endeavour to fit beauty standards? Or B. Stay true to yourself & be kind to yourself as you work towards self acceptance & self growth? Lmk in the comments! 🧐

There is NOTHING wrong with you. The sooner you realise it, the sooner you'll be able to treat your mind & body with the kindness it deserves 💛

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

The hormones in a woman's body cause us to store fat in places we're taught to feel ashamed of… 😮‍💨⤵️

Our thighs, legs, stomachs, arms, cheeks, hips, etc

None of those things are actually bad, they're just part of being ✨ human ✨ 

This isn't ONLY directed at female bodies… ALL bodies are different 💫

Accepting & even “romanticising” that has helped me see the divinity in all of these squishy, dimply, wrinkly, magical parts of me.

I hope it helps you start seeing yourself through a gentler lens too🪞❤️‍🩹

It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same.

When is the recovery tag NOT awful.So many pro Ed accounts hide behind the recovery tags to pretend it will save them from being called proWhen all it does is flood the safe space for actual people recovering, with proana bullshit. Keep proana triggering shit in the proana tags. Its not that hard. Why can no one figure this out. No one gives a shit if someone is proana only for themselves, pro recovery for everyone else yeah no shit. Stay out of the tags. Where do these people think recovery accounts even go?

Rendering tags similar to those, which could reasonably be a good place to put or look for actual recovery content, useless and actively harmful for recovering people. Stop pretending what you're doing is okay. A tag like that doesn't change anything about you or your content.

 Fellow ed people  Please don't give each other tips on how to purge. It's super dangerous and addictive. And even if you would get out of the purging? Do it long enough and there you go: scared you will die if you throw up once after drinking too much. Or die if you get ill and throw up. Because everytime you throw up there is blood. Doesn't mather you haven't purged in a year. There is blood. You will not die pretty and thin. You will die face on the toilet, stomach literally exploded and only thing keeping your insides in is your skin. And that skin? It's purple because yeah well your stomach just exploded. Teeth gone, hair gone, nails gone. And your face is buffy and bruised no mather what the scale says.  Just. Don't. Give. Tips.

📚“Man, I wish i chose a different major.” 

🥾“I wish I chose a different life path.”

🖇“I wish I didn't take this job.”

ESPECIALLY if you see your friends or people that you know, or maybe people on Facebook loving the life that they chose. 

Here's a reframe to try out:  ✨There is something in that contrast that you would like for your own life. ✨

It's actually a blessing to have that feeling because it confirms there's something you actually want.

Your work is in learning how to shift your current life, into the life that you want to live. 

If you can see these comparisons as enlightening tools for you to identify what you want in your life vs. seeing them as “something I'll never have and I'm stuck with the lesser option,”

🦋I promise you, things in your life will start changing.🦋

The course that will teach you how to be better?

The certification that will solve all your problems?

The program that will guide you to all your answers?

If you are… let's pause all the looking 👀OUTWARD and bring your attention ➡️inward⬅️

If there are any outstanding tasks, chores, items on your list that you've been holding off on, that's your work.

The things you've been avoiding out of fear or discomfort?

That's your work.

All those ⬆️ above totally can bring you to the next level 

AND also calling your mom more often can elevate your life in such a nourishing way.

Sticking to an exercise program (that you probably already bought but never finished) can get you to a whole other level.

So if you've been reaching for things outside yourself to level up,

Maybe it's time to reach within. And work on your basics.

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
chickpea and eggplant ratatouille 
sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about  minutes with stirring every / minutes). that's it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those  minutes just to thicken a  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

Doc ID: 7160, distribution: 0.9816775830326935 ; we're supposed to get snow here all week, which means that this SUPER GREEN LENTIL SOUP will be my dinner all week. i cant...complain...🥲 i've been making this recipe (or some variation of it) for a few months now and it truly could not be any simpler. plus it's super versatile, so use what you have on hand! warm, nourishing, and immunity boosting- the trifecta 💫

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for  hours
- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
- cup each of diced carrots and celery
- bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
- cups water
- cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don't stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

Doc ID: 2659, distribution: 0.8111338919942029 ; The PROBLEM with “CHEAT” MEALS / DAYS... and what I would recommend instead ⤵️ 

Swipe through to see a few of the reasons why I don't like “cheat” meals / days... They encourage the infamous restricting & bingeing cycle — the 'ALL OR NOTHING' mentality — it's diet culture BS & I'm not here for it at all. 

We need to try to stop seeing foods as GOOD or BAD, but rather just understand that some foods offer more or less nutrients & health benefits than other foods ~ all foods are ok to eat in moderation! 😍

What I do recommend you to do instead is incorporate some of the foods you love & crave into your daily life in balance & moderation... I, myself, have a MASSIVE sweet tooth (as you already know 🙈) so I honour that craving every day with some chocolate, or ice cream, or whatever it may be on the day. I eat it, enjoy it & don't feel guilty about it at all! What works for me is eating about % more nutritious foods & % less nutrient-dense foods EVERY DAY, that's just what works for me... Find what works for you!!

As you guys know from my previous posts & IG stories, there's no ONE food in particular that causes weight gain... Weight gain happens when you eat more than your body burns consistently, day after day, week after week. So it's ok to be mindful of what you eat and how much you eat, but PLEASE don't be afraid to EAT... The food you eat fuels everything you do in a day, all the way down to brain function, breathing, digesting food and keeping blood pumping around your body. 

Knowledge is power & balance is EVERYTHING 🤍

That's all for now,
- B ✨

i mean that most women engage in disordered eating habits. what is unclear about that? how many women do you know who DON'T binge, purge, fast, restrict, go on diets including fad diets, go on cleanses including juice cleanses, count calories, count other things they can use as proxies for calories, count the calories they burn, peg their food intake to something other than hunger, use food to control their emotions, treat food as something they must earn and don't always deserve, exercise compulsively, restrict or eliminate certain food groups based on nutritional pseudoscience, categorize foods as good and bad, experience feelings of self loathing based on what they've eaten, or use their abstention from food and control of their bodies and therefore food intake to attain feelings of purity, transcendence, or fulfillment? don't try me.

I tried to push through a small circuit, but halfway through I threw the weights down. I turned off the lights, trudged upstairs, and made this bowl instead. The past couple of days I've had some major frustrations to deal with and it's just all adding up. I'm finally overwhelmed and just need to take a step back and focus on something else. Normally the gym helps with that, but today I just wasn't feeling it. So I tossed my workout and made it a rest day, even though tomorrow's a rest day too. Big deal! My body feels physically fine, it's my mind that's sore. And nurturing the mind is just as, if not MORE, important than the body. I'm thankful to be at a place where the gym isn't a pressure anymore, and walking away from it won't create a whirlwind of anxiety and guilt. Taking this weekend at home to enjoy the company of my family and hopefully unwind and relax, as my mind needs it!
