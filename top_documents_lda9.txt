Doc ID: 6715, distribution: 0.9965594891470431 ; probably one of the most decadent and dreamy desserts i've shared to date… pun intended 😗

FOUR ingredients… you're kidding. 

i promise you'll save this so fast hahaha. you must make ASAP. details below!

-ingredient chocolate stuffed brownie cups

brownie base:

- - medium soft pitted dates, soaked in boiling water for a half hour to soften (optional, but ideal)
- / cup cacao powder
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter  
add these three ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until a dough ball forms. you should be able to roll the dough out in your hands without it breaking. if it's too loose you may need to add a tbsp or two of water to thicken.

split the dough into balls and form a cup shape, making sure the center is deep and the edges are high. place these on a parchment paper lined plate and place in the freezer to set (about  min)

while the brownie cups are setting, make the chocolate filling:

- - medium soft pitted dates
-  cup chocolate chips/chopped chocolate of choice
-  tbsp hot water  
blend in the blender until smooth and silky. i left mine on the thicker side, transferred to a bowl, and whisk in another  tbsp of water (slowly) to smooth it out and make it a bit runnier. place the chocolate filling in the fridge to thicken up a bite while the brownie cups are still setting.

remove the cups from the freezer, dollop chocolate filling into each, and place back in the freezer to set. when you're ready to eat, let them slightly thaw for a few minutes or microwave for  seconds (so good this way). this recipe made  cups for me!

no-bake (but bake them) banana bread sweet potato cookies: - / cup almond flour

- / cup coconut flour
- / cup peanut butter
- / cup maple syrup
-  mashed banana
-  roasted and chilled white sweet potato (i used jersey white sweet potato)
- sea salt
- cinnamon
- vanilla extract 
blend everything in a food processed and roll into balls. if the batter is too runny add more coconut flour until the dough is sticky and thick. then combine two balls to make one large ball of dough and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. press down to spread into a cookie and use a fork to make imprints on the tops. bake for - minutes on  or until golden brown on the bottoms.

- pinch of sea salt, cinnamon, baking powder

i've made A LOT of minimal ingredient, vegan, no-bake treats in my day (peep my feed), but these are easily in my top  of all time. that's a huge statement and i stand by it!

sharing these today (even though i've been making them for months on repeat haha) because they're the perfect last minute treat to whip up for you and your loved one. but honestly… you'll probably finish them all first on your own. fully speaking from experience here.

hope you love these as much as i do!

vanilla matcha cake 🍵🍰

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

these mini cookies can be eaten on their own, tossed in a yogurt bowl, topped on a smoothie… you name it. but they taste best drenched in milk to make the best post workout snack 💪 

while we're on the topic of cereal let's settle the timeless debate: is cereal a meal or a snack?

there's only one right answer and we all know it's a snack hahaha. i digress, recipe below!

 ingredient high protein mini cookie cereal bowl

*this is one serving!

- / cup oat flour
- / cup plant-based vanilla protein powder of choice
- / cup non-dairy milk of choice (i used vanilla)
- optional sea salt and baking powder
- mini chocolate chips for mixing in

in a bowl combine the oat flour, protein powder, and milk until a formable dough forms. i'd add the milk in increments of tablespoons so you can adjust accordingly as needed. depending on your protein powder you may need more or less milk! once you have a dough that you can roll out, stir through the chocolate chips and begin to roll the dough into mini bite-sized balls, then flattening into a cookie shape. place the mini cookies onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake at F for  min or until golden brown. let cool completely in order to harden (this is key!). once cooled, pour into a bowl and top with milk of choice. enjoy :)

this recipe is perfect if you're looking to whip up a sweet treat without having tons of leftovers. these measurements made six cookies for me, so basically one serving 👀

to be honest these cookies won't last you very long. they're so soft and perfectly flavorful. oh and VEGAN. meaning you can eat the dough before you bake it— major bonus points if you ask me 😚

small batch vegan pb pumpkin cookies

makes !

melt:

/ cup peanut butter
 tbsp coconut oil 

add:

/ cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
/ cup granulated sugar 
/ cup gluten free flour
sea salt
cinnamon 
baking powder

mix in:

chopped chocolate 

preheat oven to  and prepare a cookie sheet. 

add the peanut butter and coconut oil to a microwave safe bowl and microwave for  seconds. remove and stir until smooth. then add in the pumpkin and sugar and whisk until uniform. fold through the four, sea salt, cinnamon, and baking powder until a thick, uniform dough forms. mix in the chocolate and use a cookie scoop to transfer dough to the cookie sheet. bake for - minutes or until golden brown. let cool to set before enjoying (also amazing right out of the oven they'll just crumble a bit)!

these fears can be SOOOO debilitating and can stop you from actually going for what you want, and BEING who you want to be.

when i peeled back the layers of each fear-based belief, i realized that they all stemmed from a common-thread belief that honestly sounded so illogical.

when i realized what it was and did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

❌“my parents are going to be so disappointed in me”

became➡️

✅“my parents love me unconditionally, and their reaction to my passion/path is not my responsibility. my decision to choose what i want over what they want is independent of my love and respect for them.”

❌“its too late to change my path, there's not enough time”

became➡️ 

✅“i don't operate on any one timeline. i can create what i want whenever i want. this is the game of life.”

❌“i might make the wrong choice and regret it”

became➡️ 

✅ “every choice i make leads me to a more compassionate & aware version of myself. the more i practice making choices, the better i get at discerning which will be best for me.”

❌“im not skilled/smart/capable enough to do it.”

became➡️ 

✅”I can do anything i set my mind to. what matters more than my SKILL is how much i ENJOY the process.”

❌“i will lose friends and connections in my community

became➡️ 

✅”i do not need to be understood. I have value to share. my ideal community is full of people who want to hear my message.”

✨finding your purpose is only one part of the equation…. we have to let go of those fears to make room for the life we dream about.

Doc ID: 8873, distribution: 0.9970322590707226 ; advice/tips on handling being down/overwhlemed from the pandemic?

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup 🥰

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right ones👁

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

❌our problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right path🌲no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

🙉you don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people… who would have known i “just” had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

🦋i have a few spots for : coaching in february 👀  so if you want to work with me this month to get clear on your purpose, drop your old ways, and build confidence in your direction, my application is in my bio and my DM box is always open🦋

Doc ID: 9506, distribution: 0.9968391561982665 ; not enough people talk about it, but being in your early 's is HARD.

growing up, i always dreamed of the early years post-college. we get told our early 's are “the best years of our lives”, and i fantasized about the new sense of freedom i'd have thinking i'd be working my dream job and having fun, going out, and being happy all the time.

don't get me wrong, i am very grateful for this life of mine and feel so blessed for the people in my life, the job i have, and the situation i'm in, but what i never realized was that being in this in between stage between being in school and having an established career and between being a kid and being an adult often feels frustrating, conflicting, and confusing as heck.

i've spent a lot of days the past few months feeling lost in life, anxious about not knowing my purpose, and terrified of the future because i have no idea what i plan on doing or where my path will lead me. but, on the days my mind is a little quieter, i'm able to reassure myself that

i don't need to have all the answers,
there's still so much time for me to become all that i'm meant to be,
what is meant for me will not pass me,
i do not need to prove my worth,
my best is always enough,
i deserve to give myself a break,
and there is so much peace to be found in the unknown.

sometimes, especially with social media and seeing people's highlight reels, it can feel isolating to feel this way, but talking to blake and some friends from school, i realize that these feelings are ones that a lot of us are feeling, and it brings me comfort knowing that i'm not the only one. so, to my fellow -something year olds:

you are not alone, and we will be okay.

disclaimer: i know not everyone follows the traditional life timeline, and there is no right or wrong way to go through life. it's okay and normal not to have it all together no matter what your age is or where you are in life. sending love to all beings.

Doc ID: 2427, distribution: 0.996522363655791 ; My personality really went from 👹 THEN to 🥰 NOW… Anyone else feel like they don't even know the person they used to be anymore? HAHA the growth game is strong.

Q for you: do you feel like you take aligned action towards the things that matter to you, the life you dream of & the person you want to be? Answer honestly with a 🙋🏻‍♀️ or 🙅🏻‍♀️ below!

In all honesty, I used to be a pretty negative person. I tried so hard to fit in. I fed habits that didn't serve me AT ALL. I was reactive. I wasn't myself. I played small. I doubted myself. I tried to grow up so quickly. Had a negative relationship with food & my body. Put myself down. Gave into peer pressure. Spent time with people who didn't bring out the best in me. Compared myself constantly. Got mad all the time, and felt bad all the time.

But that's all part of learning about yourself, right? You learn from your mistakes, you get a sense of what does & doesn't feel like 'you'. You start setting boundaries, attracting YOUR people, knowing your worth, doing more of what makes you feel good & start living your life on YOUR terms. You also usually outgrow really bad haircuts HAHA.

If you're not where you want to be right now, just remember that you're in the perfect position for growth. You're learning every day. And you're always evolving, so you don't have to have it all figured out right now. I feel worlds apart from the person I was even just a few years ago, and I'm sure I'll say the same thing a few years from now about my current self. But at the end of the day, I'm so grateful for every version of me, because I wouldn't be the person I am today without HER 🫶

——
you know that feeling when someone makes a comment - maybe it was jokingly mean, maybe it was just something naive, maybe it was constructive criticism, most likely it had  negative intentions - that just totally destabilizes you for the rest of the day? yeah, that used to happen to me A LOT. for a long time, i thought that i was just someone who was overly emotional and easily triggered, and there wasn't too much that i could do about it.  recently though, i realized that although my past has affected who i am, that doesn't mean it has to control me, and i have been working on being more aware of what my feelings are in those moments and where they are rooted from, so that i can gain inner peace and my power back.
——
while i still do emotionally react (last night on the phone with my mom 🙄), it's been happening less and less, and it's a freeing moment when something that used to trigger you happens, and you're able to recognize it, acknowledge it, and let it go~
——
some of the things i've been doing/hoping to add to gain more self-awareness and inner peace:
- meditation!! this is sometimes just a few minutes of lying in bed with my hands on my belly and intentionally breathing before i sleep. meditation isn't always peaceful either, a big part of the experience for me has been getting comfortable with the turbulence
- more alone time
- walks outside
- more mindfulness in all aspects of life
- more sleep
- practicing self-compassion
- hoping to add: more yoga (signed up for a class for this evening!) and more empty days for rest

in my people pleasing past, i learned how to control the reactions of other people so that i could be in their favor by doing what ~i thought~ would make them happy

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others? 

in the most loving way i can say this- people don't care like you think they do. 

do the thing, make the jump, hire the person, make the change 

your best and highest version is waiting for you 😇🦋

if want support on this, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

Doc ID: 9578, distribution: 0.9960079501808239 ; last night i caught myself starting to go down the comparison trap.

even though the self-doubting thoughts only lasted a couple minutes before i was able to cut them off and distract myself, here are just some of the thoughts that were going through my head:

why doesn't my instagram page look as ~aesthetic~ as others? why don't i have anything more inspiring or insightful to share? how does it seem so effortless for them? should i be connecting with more people? do people even care about my online presence? what do people think of me? are they judging me? do they think i'm boring? what am i even doing on here? do i belong?

most days on this platform, i do me, i appreciate and admire others, and i don't feel like i should be doing anything differently because at the end of the day, this page reflects ME, and as long i'm staying true to myself, then i feel pretty good about having this outlet. but, i'm not immune to the gratification that comes from likes, growth, engagement, and every now and then i question myself, what i'm doing, and the timing of it all.

we compare our personal lives to situations, people, and things we consider “ideal” and forget to recognize that not every ideal we are subjected to is applicable for ourselves. when's the last time you appreciated yourself, recognized your strengths, and celebrated all the different qualities that make you YOU?

ending this caption with a mantra for myself and anyone else who might need to here it:

you are not behind. being behind means there's someone on your path ahead of you, but no one is on your path except for you. breathe deep, remember who you are, and stay true to yourself. you are exactly where you need to be.

it's what we all want right? it's why social media got so big so fast. we figured out we can c o n n e c t with people, from all over the world (well, most places), at any given time, and instantly. so the fire spread.

we connect and connect and connect. unintentionally giving our precious energy and time when we should be holding it close. we connect so much that we might reach outward—just a bit too far—that we pull outside of ourselves. 
we disconnect with the self. we disconnect with the actual world around us. we disconnect with our own voice as other voices tug us here and there, further from ourselves.

connection is good. connection is energizing. it's how we survived and it's how we spread love.

however,  what connects us can disconnect us at times and make us forget about the most important connection we have.

I like to practice deleting social media from my phone from time to time for my own sanity. I like to lose track of time on my yoga mat. I like to listen to music and feel around every note and dip and drop and melody and symphony and harmony. I like to look at clouds.

the way you reconnect with your self is going to look different than what everyone else does because, well, you're different. whatever it is, here's your reminder. 
how do you reconnect with you? gym? hiking? reading? spending time with family? painting? I wanna know 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻❤️

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water    
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - sautéed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream.

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.954388176119194 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

NONE of these bodies are “better” or “worse” than the others.

some angles, my body looks differently than it does at others.
some days, i view my body differently than i do on others.
some pictures, my body looks different than it does in others.
some periods in life, my body is different than it is during others.

point is: NONE of that matters because your body has absolutely NOTHING to do with your worth, and ALL bodies are beautiful and incredible ones.

Doc ID: 2635, distribution: 0.9353199145451017 ; Possibly the most realistic weight loss post you'll ever see & read. And that's because this isn't just a “weight loss transformation”. Let me tell you why...

In this post I'm not going to put my very worst photos beside my very best because I wanna get REAL. 

In the photos on the left, I was kgs heavier, I had a really bad relationship with food and my body image. I was disgusted by my body & all of the things I initially considered “flaws”: my cellulite, my rolls, my bloated tummy, everything. I couldn't bear to see my own reflection. 

But just in case you have the impression that weight loss is going to magically fix all the things you're insecure about, I wanted to show you from my own experience that even though you think losing weight is going to make you happy or erase all of your insecurities... It probably won't. Even now, after I've lost kgs, I still get bloated, I still have cellulite, I still have rolls when I sit, dips in my hips and a lower belly bump. But the difference NOW is that I understand the definition of flaw (“a mark or other imperfection which weakens a substance or object”) does not apply to any part of my body — does cellulite, bloating & a lower belly bump WEAKEN me??? Absolutely heckin' NOT. See, self-acceptance happens on the INSIDE!

What I've realised along the way is that this was a HEALTH & HAPPINESS transformation... Not a weight loss transformation. I live a healthy lifestyle because I love my body, not because I hate it. So no matter what journey you're on right now, remember all the amazing things your body is doing for you, not just the way it looks. Be kind to your body, fuel it well, live a healthy balanced lifestyle, exercise because you can — not because you have to, and my gosh, just enjoy your life... 💛

Doc ID: 1627, distribution: 0.9908948696094806 ; Not sure why I have to say this for the literal th time but using ed recovery pro recovery or any kind of recovery tags on a blatantly triggering pro ed post doesnt redeem you for posting pro ed content. It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.

For me personally, sometimes it just doesnt matter enough to worry about. Slip ups are fine and eating a lot is fine. As long as we eat and move on from it, worrying about it too much just causes more problems. Not worth it. My body will figure it out.

I filmed this on my first day in the city and if you've watched episode  of the Edinburgh vlogs then you'll know I did get drenched on this run 🙈🌧 However . . . as you guys know, running is simply my favourite way to explore a new place because you get to see so much on foot 👏🏻
-
I ran around the Meadows (which gets very busy with runners in the evening I realised), then basically got lost (not a surprise 😉), but I eventually ended up in Princes Street Gardens right by the castle 🏰

Doc ID: 3436, distribution: 0.9959975813531302 ; Saturday! What a great day for rejuvenating! ✌

Everyone deals with ambivalence and challenging days. It's a normal part of recovery, really. Why not plan ahead for those times and create something you can lean on when you need it? That's what the first prompt is all about! 💞

If you're not feeling the writing vibe today, that's okay! Grab some paper and glue and make a coping skill collage. Hang it some place where you will see it often. Did you know that the more you look at something, the more it gets itself into your subconscious and works in your favor? It's the same principle that is behind creating vision boards -- we're just going to apply it to coping skills!🎭

Above the notebook, in the upper right-hand corner, there are two illustrated white and yellow Daisys. Not the upper left corner is the MEDA logo that reads “MEDA: Better Starts Here.” On the notebook, under a highlighted text that reads “Journal Prompts,” text that looks handwritten below reads, . Write a letter of encouragement to yourself. Acknowledge your progress and give yourself a pep talk. Save it to read on a day you need it. . Make a collage of coping skills you can use to manage urges to use behaviors. . Set a timer for five minutes and practice sitting with yourself. Be curious. What comes up? Tell yourself this is an opportunity to be with yourself differently. . Imagine ten years have passed; write a letter from that future perspective to yourself right now.
