these fears can be SOOOO debilitating and can stop you from actually going for what you want, and BEING who you want to be.

when i peeled back the layers of each fear-based belief, i realized that they all stemmed from a common-thread belief that honestly sounded so illogical.

when i realized what it was and did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

❌“my parents are going to be so disappointed in me”

became➡️

✅“my parents love me unconditionally, and their reaction to my passion/path is not my responsibility. my decision to choose what i want over what they want is independent of my love and respect for them.”

❌“its too late to change my path, there's not enough time”

became➡️ 

✅“i don't operate on any one timeline. i can create what i want whenever i want. this is the game of life.”

❌“i might make the wrong choice and regret it”

became➡️ 

✅ “every choice i make leads me to a more compassionate & aware version of myself. the more i practice making choices, the better i get at discerning which will be best for me.”

❌“im not skilled/smart/capable enough to do it.”

became➡️ 

✅”I can do anything i set my mind to. what matters more than my SKILL is how much i ENJOY the process.”

❌“i will lose friends and connections in my community

became➡️ 

✅”i do not need to be understood. I have value to share. my ideal community is full of people who want to hear my message.”

✨finding your purpose is only one part of the equation…. we have to let go of those fears to make room for the life we dream about.

Doc ID: 8653, distribution: 0.98892540983556 ; Maybe you're tired of living the same day all over again

Maybe you're tired of scrolling seeing other people doing the thing you want to do

Maybe you're tired of feeling like you'll never get to do the things you want because of your situation

The difference between you right now & the people you strive to be like, or your dream vision “you” is that…

You're still in your comfort zone.

You've let the small things keep you here, rather than throw them right back and move forward with your beautiful gentle power.

Getting to a new, more exciting place requires stepping out and trusting yourself. 

I've coached women through leaving their job, starting a new venture, finally taking the trainings they have been too scared to take, traveling the world for their heart's sake, and actually pausing everything to do the RESTING that their bodies have craved.

So here's to trusting yourself, trusting yourself to get up, brush yourself off, and to keep moving. 

_______

My -month coaching program, Flourish with Purpose is where women who feel stuck and unfulfilled in their job/path come to: 

🔥reignite their flame 
🌏learn how they can uniquely make an impact on the world
⭐️gain confidence & support to pursue their dreams
💅🏼live life on their own terms

I'm only taking a few clients at a time.

Doc ID: 8712, distribution: 0.9871094690536801 ; hint: you don't actually need to HAVE all the things or truly be confident and clear on your forward motion for this to work!

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
——
we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

Doc ID: 8721, distribution: 0.9854587424850796 ; if you have been feeling stuck, start with figuring out these three things (completely free exercises!): 

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there.

Being a highly sensitive person (HSP) doesn't have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨

i used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!

Some (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:

🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.

🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.

👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner world and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.

👀🔎Ability to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! 

😻Appreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.

⚖️Strong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the world.

😌💭Deep self-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and self-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.

being a highly sensitive person can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make their “sensitivity” their STRENGTH 💪🏽 in living their most aligned life. 

if youve ever felt a pull to work with me, my next spaces for coaching open up in April! so even if you aren't ready now, apply to save a spot ❤️✨

Doc ID: 9454, distribution: 0.980794502930079 ; last week, i unexpectedly lost one of the most important and present people in my life, my 外公.

my grandpa moved to america a couple days before i was born and was here for me as a constant source of love, strength, and joy for over  years. having lived in cleveland my whole life at this point, i feel so fortunate to have been able to spend a lot of time with family. while i feel very grateful to have gotten more time than many people do with my grandpa, there's so many activities, celebrations, milestones that just won't be the same without his presence.

the hardest part of experiencing grief the past few days has been facing a lot of feelings of guilt and regrets for all the things i could've said or could've done to show my grandpa i love him and make the most of my time with him.  i can only hope that he knew that i cared about him and appreciated all his small efforts and try my best to move forward, to remember how precious life is with every human interaction, and to give myself and others grace. i share this because grief is hard and uncomfortable to feel and to talk about, but it's also very real and something all of us experience at some point in our lives.

no matter what pain or hardships you are going through, it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to take time to feel your feelings, it's okay to do what you need to do for yourself. the rest of the world can wait.

i hope my grandpa rests easy, and his legacy lives on through many cherished memories and the strength he instilled in all the lives he touched. i love you, grandpa. you will forever be missed.

relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

even if you're not where you want to be, look at how far you've come!! i'm so proud of you, and if you need the reminder: each moment is another chance at a new beginning, and it's never too late to choose yourself 🌷

——
while i've come a long way with letting go, i have days where i get caught up in the should'ves, could'ves, and would'ves too. some days, my mind naturally goes to beating myself up about something that's already happened, and it can be really hard to stop it, let go, and move on especially when it seems that there are reminders constantly.
——
what i try to remind myself of is that enforcing feelings guilt and regret has NEVER ever been good for me, but being my own friend and giving myself grace can help create space for me to grow and heal.

the present is all we have right now. who you are in this moment is more than enough.

details for these vegan twix bars below! the date caramel recipe alone makes this post worth saving… you'll want to eat it by the spoonful.

vegan twix bars

crust:

- / cup oats
-  cup soaked raw cashews (i did / cashews and / dry roasted peanuts)
-  tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil 
-  tbsp maple syrup 

date caramel layer: 
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter (can also use creamy salted almond butter)
-  tbsp maple syrup 
- - medium soft dates, pitted
- splash of vanilla
- sea salt
- cinnamon

chocolate layer: 
-  chocolate bar of choice, chopped
-  tbsp peanut butter 

directions:

add all of the crust ingredients in a blender and blender until uniform. transger to a brownie pan (i used a small tupperware) and form into a solid layer. place in the fridge to set for five minutes. while that's setting, make the date caramel layer by adding all of those ingredients to the blender (rinsed after making the crust) and blend until smooth/uniform. you may need to add more water in  tbsp increments to get the blender moving, especially if it's not a super high power one! transfer the caramel onto the crust layer and place back in the fridge to set for a few minutes. melt the chocolate and peanut butter (i use the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between). once smooth, pour over the caramel, spread evenly, and place in the fridge for set for at least  hours. remove, let thaw for a few minutes, slice, and store in the fridge!

- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16376, distribution: 0.9883965240934038 ; I texted T that quote I posted yesterday and said omg it's me. She replied “yes, it is you… but you're learning that your feelings are valid now” I first came across the quote as I was looking something else up in the book, and it really reminded me of how things were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet looking calm on the outside. That is definitely a thing I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It's strange to think it's not normal actually. Doesn't everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone's brain works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else's. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that's probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I've never really spoken about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was “quite avoidant” when it came up in conversation over something, but that's about it. Of course it's been referred to in the context of my responses to other things, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever therapists do when they figure out the theory of what's going on with their clients. I think it's perhaps something to talk about a bit more next session, 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16185, distribution: 0.9870670857611166 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16512, distribution: 0.9870670857611166 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15372, distribution: 0.986465004265356 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15470, distribution: 0.9852021130457499 ; Therapy .. // rupture time again  My therapist and I had a bit of a rupture last session. We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14425, distribution: 0.9845963129451251 ; Therapy .. // I still hate starting  I think I could be in therapy for  years and still not be good at starting a session. This session I looked around the room blankly and eventually pulled a helpless face at T, and she just raised her eyebrows back at me and smiled in a kind of carefully equally-helpless “yes, this is a dilemma isn't it?” I sighed and looked at my short page of notes and said “I'm trying to decide what order to say things in”. This is just a variation on things I say to try and get started. “Hmm ok. Well, you could start with the most difficult to get it out of the way, or you could build up to it and do it last but we might run out of time…” This is also just a variation on things T says in response to me trying to get started. I wish I could be someone who just sits down and start splurging their innermost thoughts. I seem to need  or  minutes for the emotional pressure to build up enough to get me speaking. I don't know whether there's any way to bypass this. I might bring it up next session. If nothing else, it will be a different way to start 🤷‍♀️ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15367, distribution: 0.9839387947616414 ; Therapy .. // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or…, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. “Maybe there's not a Perfect cake” said T, “Maybe there's just a Good Enough cake.” That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I'm in a 'which cake' dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don't want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I'm away (benefits of online therapy y'all). 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16591, distribution: 0.9832226403092553 ; I emailed T my story. She read it straight away and replied that it was a really good story and she liked the name I had given the heroine. (There isn't much heroic about her imho but I get it's just what you call it) Then she said that the story feels unfinished and she wants to know what happened next…but no rush to write the next instalment. (There isn't another instalment) I guess we'll talk about it next therapy session. I think last session when T said what she said, it made little Faith think that T is on her side and be finally able to trust T enough to speak up. I don't know but that's what it feels like. When I read the story, I think yep that sounds pretty messed up. Yet if I try and think about the story in context of me, I think ehhh it was just how it was. Reading in black and white the facts as I remember them, I can see loads of reasons why I might have developed an eating disorder (or indeed any other coping strategy for anxiety) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.9830078181930803 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

there are so many valid reasons to eat other than “for fuel”including not having a clear reason at all. food doesn't have to have so much power over you, and there are SO many more important things in life to focus on and experience because at the end of the day, food is just food, and each individual food choice you make doesn't need to be so complicated.

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Doc ID: 2657, distribution: 0.9395648189436665 ; Welcome to my th Real Me Monday post: social media VS real life ✨ REAL BODY EDITION ✨

As you guys already know, each week I post the posed, tensed, IG-worthy photos of myself beside the real, unposed, in-between snapshots! And this week we'll still be doing that, but this time it's going to be purely focused on showing you just HOW MUCH a lil bit of posing, tensing, good posture & bend of the body can change how our bodies look! 🤯

Swipe across to see a bunch of my IG VS REALITY photos showcasing my bloating, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks & loose skin — my body % of the time! 🙊

Which one of these  is your fav? Lmk in the comments, I'll be replying to them all! 💛 Anyway, happy Monday my friends, I give you full permission to walk into this week with confidence & loving self-thoughts! 😏 I hope your week is just as AMAZING as you are! 🧚🏻‍♀️

P.s. I'll be posting some more healthy recipes, workouts, transformation photos from my kg weight loss, a post about bullying & my experience with it (🙅🏻‍♀️) & more to my IG feed throughout the week so stay posted! ✨

NONE of these bodies are “better” or “worse” than the others.

some angles, my body looks differently than it does at others.
some days, i view my body differently than i do on others.
some pictures, my body looks different than it does in others.
some periods in life, my body is different than it is during others.

point is: NONE of that matters because your body has absolutely NOTHING to do with your worth, and ALL bodies are beautiful and incredible ones.

Doc ID: 2634, distribution: 0.927603470695388 ; Happy Real Me Monday my friends... But with ✨ a special lil twist ✨ 

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.9127773293451381 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those “less flattering” angles.

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark — it's coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio 😍

Doc ID: 2469, distribution: 0.9056051453387165 ; ✨ When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change ✨

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9023231488961324 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

I met with my treatment team and they said that I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Also my insurance company denied tms treatment but the doctor said he would do it for free. A lot of my friends (patients) left today and I'm happy for them but I'll miss them. It's also hard to see so many people come here after me and leave before me. I spent a lot of the day crying bc so many people were leaving. It was my favorite staff member's last shift tonight and that was super hard for me.

My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I've basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I'm just so tired all the time and I don't want to be awake.

One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I'm sad but also happy for her.
