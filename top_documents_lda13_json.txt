Most of us have mastered certain poses that allow us to literally transform our bodies within seconds... Myself included. But this just goes to show that no matter how flawless we may look online, that's just not the reality most of the time. Our lumps, bumps and rolls are normal and nothing to be ashamed of ⭐️

The hormones in a woman's body cause us to store fat in places we're taught to feel ashamed of… 😮‍💨⤵️

Our thighs, legs, stomachs, arms, cheeks, hips, etc

None of those things are actually bad, they're just part of being ✨ human ✨ 

This isn't ONLY directed at female bodies… ALL bodies are different 💫

Accepting & even “romanticising” that has helped me see the divinity in all of these squishy, dimply, wrinkly, magical parts of me.

I hope it helps you start seeing yourself through a gentler lens too🪞❤️‍🩹

Doc ID: 2392, distribution: 0.9444249207075365 ; You will never ✨actually✨ see your own body. You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Doc ID: 2634, distribution: 0.940136328261825 ; Happy Real Me Monday my friends... But with ✨ a special lil twist ✨ 

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

As you guys already know, each week I post the posed, tensed, IG-worthy photos of myself beside the real, unposed, in-between snapshots! And this week we'll still be doing that, but this time it's going to be purely focused on showing you just HOW MUCH a lil bit of posing, tensing, good posture & bend of the body can change how our bodies look! 🤯

Swipe across to see a bunch of my IG VS REALITY photos showcasing my bloating, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks & loose skin — my body % of the time! 🙊

Which one of these  is your fav? Lmk in the comments, I'll be replying to them all! 💛 Anyway, happy Monday my friends, I give you full permission to walk into this week with confidence & loving self-thoughts! 😏 I hope your week is just as AMAZING as you are! 🧚🏻‍♀️

Welcome to a special Real Me Monday  recap!! Here's my fav RMM photos from across the year to remind you that bodies are ever-changing & to never compare yourself to what you see online or in the media. 

Not only does your body change day-to-day & year-to-year, but also with different lighting, poses, angles or clothing, so it's hardly fair to base your worth or judge yourself on something as fickle & ever-changing as your body.

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼

Don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home. Sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

I think  is the year you no longer hold yourself back! Wear the shorts, enjoy the food, move your body bc you can — not bc you have to, be gentle with yourself & remember that your body is the least interesting thing about you!! Leave a “🥂” in the comments if you're with me! 🥰

Doc ID: 2602, distribution: 0.920618338540818 ; Next time you're having a bad body image day, remember this: your body is the least interesting thing about you & you are so much more than a body!! 🦋

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Wearing @baseline's new Seamless collection 😍 absolutely adore these pieces & the gorgeous ribbed fabric!! You can get % off too with the code BREE - orders over $ get free shipping! 🥳

Doc ID: 2483, distribution: 0.9084475020634679 ; The gym selfie you usually see online VS what you'd *actually* see at the gym ⭐️

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It's from their new Eclipse collection & I've been living in it 😍 [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know 💛

Happy Real Me Monday 🦋 have the best week xo

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.9423482559326181 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9934239483816196 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.990538378270879 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9888096837116885 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 15788, distribution: 0.9874293644079792 ; I'm really fed up with d's therapist. d last saw her on about the  March, and prior to that had been seeing her weekly every week we could manage (so sometimes it was alternate weeks). Then the therapist didn't open up any slots for April so I couldn't book another session, and then the lockdown happened. I presumed she wasn't seeing clients at the moment since she works face to face and I hadn't hear otherwise from her. Then with the current d “crisis”, I decided to look and see what her website says, and lo and behold she's got slots open all week. I emailed her and she replied that she's still seeing clients using Zoom. I'm annoyed with her for not even checking in on d who she hasn't seen or heard from for five weeks, or making us aware of the Zoom option. It's not like d is an adult who has any independent contact with the therapist, so it can hardly be considered d's responsibility to request a session. Plus doesn't she have a duty of care to a client to not just let them drop off the face of the earth without at least reaching out?? I actually like this therapist and think she was helping d, but right now I'm thoroughly fed up with her and feel quite let down by her. I guess she's not my therapist for me to have that rant at her. I know I will end up asking d if she wants a Zoom session with her though because they already have that relationship and she knows all the background so it would be daft to not utilise it when it's needed. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16185, distribution: 0.9864218931990696 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15372, distribution: 0.986107084975249 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15470, distribution: 0.9844654423423385 ; Therapy .. // rupture time again  My therapist and I had a bit of a rupture last session. We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15367, distribution: 0.9831403807997707 ; Therapy .. // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or…, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. “Maybe there's not a Perfect cake” said T, “Maybe there's just a Good Enough cake.” That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I'm in a 'which cake' dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don't want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I'm away (benefits of online therapy y'all). 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15104, distribution: 0.978523009009424 ; Therapy .. // Part two // just be on my side!!  T asked me some questions about how my  year old self felt about moving up two years at school, but I didn't really feel safe to answer her. My  year old self does not feel T is fully on her side. T seems to often go back to defending my parents or justifying their decision, or sometimes even just being too rational about the whole situation and it just makes me want to cry pitifully and say “why can't you just be on my side?” So I couldn't jump into further discussion with T without laying that out on the table. It took me some minutes to build up the courage to say anything… my brain gets carried away working out what to say. Eventually I took the plunge and said “Can I ask you something?” Of course T said yes. So I said, “Can we… you…. just presume - when I'm talking about this stuff - that I don't need you to defend or justify my parents? That I've got all that stuff on full volume in my head anyway and I don't need you to say it.” T said “Yes. So what have I said today that defends your parents?” That didn't feel defensive on her part, more curious as to how I experience what she says. “No, not today, nothing today, but you did last week. And I just… it took so long to get past me believing they were perfect and that it was me that was the problem…. and now I'm trying to see that not so good side as well but it seems like whenever I say anything negative about them, you're always defending them.” T said “OK, I think it would be helpful if you told me immediately, if you felt like I was defending them. Then we could speak about it.” I nodded. She continued “You did think they were perfect for a long while - I still remember our very first session, when you told me 'oh no, there's nothing wrong with my childhood, there's nothing to talk about there' - and I heard that as a warning from you. A sort of 'don't even go there' message. So I needed to let you find your own way to your conclusions and not put my thoughts on to you. If I'd told you some of what I was feeling, it would have pushed you back into defending them again. But now I think you've got there, you are more realistic about them. You know they weren't perfect and I'm trying to help you get to a more balanced view, without tipping too far over into anger at them.” “But maybe I just need to do that…. to go the other way for a bit… before coming back to a balanced view” “Yes” T said thoughtfully, “I was just thinking that. Maybe you do need to be angry at them for a while.” “It really feels like, whenever I say anything negative, then you try and be rational about it and then you leave me on my own with how I'm feeling. And I just want you to be on my side!” 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16905, distribution: 0.9781763675915756 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Doc ID: 16694, distribution: 0.9721206790388961 ; My sister and her husband and my two little nephews are coming to stay this weekend. My nephews are  and  and adore their cousins, but they haven't ever been to our house before as usually we go up to their house (it being about  times the size of ours!) I have a rough plan for the weekend and for the meals so feeling like that's organised. My sister and family can have our bedroom, which has plenty of floor space for the nephews too. Then H and I will sleep in d's double bed. d will sleep in d's pull out bed, and d will just sleep in her own bed. The baby room is still free but there's no space for anyone to sleep in there unless they don't mind hopping in the cot.  Today my main task is tidying and cleaning. I have a mountain of ironing from the holiday washing, but I like ironing. I can catch up on the latest episode of The Apprentice while I'm doing it. Cleaning bathrooms I don't like so much but I must grit my teeth and just get on with it. I'll bribe myself with a reward for after I've done them. Looking forward to a glass of wine tonight too 🍾 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14742, distribution: 0.9668355386278343 ; It's Wednesday rd December. Here are my plans for the day: Run (this may or may not happen because there's a lot of rain) Start (and finish?) my last cross-stitch Christmas card  Work on my Christmas Bookshelf jigsaw Read more of my current book (CJ Tudor, The Other People) Looking good for a day of relaxation. Soon I will get out of bed and start it 😂 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16174, distribution: 0.965652362723646 ; Two-run-Saturday   I've been for two runs today. I didn't plan it that way, but I went to parkrun (got a PB, yay!!) and then came home and looked at the weather forecast because I heard rumours of a big STORM approaching. Seriously looks like it's going to be hard to even stay upright never mind run, so in the afternoon after I'd done an hour of maths tutoring, I popped back out to do my  minute “easy run”. It is easy, it's at a very steady pace, I just put my headphones on and trot along enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. So now, run done and tomorrow can be a rest day with all the wind and rain from Storm Ciara. I think it might still be bad on Monday when I am scheduled to run, but I will deal with that when we get there. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19737, distribution: 0.9621549121518247 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I didn't sleep well last night (as usual). I went to a couple groups but didn't really like them. My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I've basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I'm just so tired all the time and I don't want to be awake. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19767, distribution: 0.9607707695556993 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I'm sad but also happy for her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16844, distribution: 0.9579950975319176 ; Phew I just went out with d for her first driving practice in our car. Omg it's quite terrifying being at the mercy of a  year old behind the wheel of your car! She's had  hours of lessons. She's doing pretty well really although she doesn't like to go past second gear (and I'm not complaining because the few times we got into third gear felt like we were going far too fast). We drove a few miles down a long quiet road twice and did a couple of loops of an estate. Driving instructors are heroes. I couldn't do that all day every day, my nerves would be shot. If I wasn't toying with being sober for October, I'd have a glass of wine right now. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19793, distribution: 0.9576747719299292 ; Day  of inpatient was boring. I woke up early and couldn't fall back asleep. I watched some tv and then went back to sleep. Then I spent some time with friends and went on a walk. Then I went back to sleep. I slept through most of today so I guess my mood was okay. I'm still really sad about my favorite nurse leaving. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15677, distribution: 0.9542894828249722 ; I went for a run today and it was so hot that I had to break off in the middle of running intervals and go into a nearby petrol station to buy a bottle of water. Thank goodness for having Apple Pay on my phone. Then I had to do the rest of the run carrying the water which was irritating but worth it because I felt so much better after rehydrating. I think Coach Greg was having a bad day when he set today's schedule. It was haaaaard. And it had this extra bit tagged on the end of the main bit that just felt like an unnecessary and spiteful little addition 😖 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21672, distribution: 0.9540482266309457 ; Day  of inpatient was super boring. I got put back on level one so I couldn't go on the fresh air walks and I had to miss some groups. I slept for part of the day and just sat around for the rest of it. Overall, it was a pretty shitty day and I'm glad it's over. I hope tomorrow is better.

It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same.

Doc ID: 8653, distribution: 0.9882199839747512 ; Maybe you're tired of living the same day all over again

Maybe you're tired of scrolling seeing other people doing the thing you want to do

Maybe you're tired of feeling like you'll never get to do the things you want because of your situation

The difference between you right now & the people you strive to be like, or your dream vision “you” is that…

You're still in your comfort zone.

You've let the small things keep you here, rather than throw them right back and move forward with your beautiful gentle power.

Getting to a new, more exciting place requires stepping out and trusting yourself. 

I've coached women through leaving their job, starting a new venture, finally taking the trainings they have been too scared to take, traveling the world for their heart's sake, and actually pausing everything to do the RESTING that their bodies have craved.

So here's to trusting yourself, trusting yourself to get up, brush yourself off, and to keep moving.

Doc ID: 8812, distribution: 0.986947873010405 ; The biggest fear holding most people back from living their truest lives is people JUDGING them…⁠
⁠
While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.
⁠
Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ⇣⁠
✨ the  year old version of you ⁠
✨ the  year old version of you
✨ people who are curious about the things you are but don't have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
✨ people who your message will inspire and change
⁠
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

Doc ID: 8712, distribution: 0.9862898536253889 ; hint: you don't actually need to HAVE all the things or truly be confident and clear on your forward motion for this to work!

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

i'm proud of you. keep fighting.

love,
 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they're easier to deal with, and when good times come, they're more fully enjoyed.

it's moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i've come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

shoutout to everyone healing from things others don't know about, making progress that no one recognizes, and fighting battles others may not understand.

i see you. I'm proud of you. keep going.

Doc ID: 8721, distribution: 0.9845356883535816 ; if you have been feeling stuck, start with figuring out these three things (completely free exercises!): 

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

Being a highly sensitive person (HSP) doesn't have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨

i used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!

Some (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:

🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.

🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.

👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner world and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.

Doc ID: 9518, distribution: 0.9783919743579792 ; shoutout to everyone...

relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

even if you're not where you want to be, look at how far you've come!! i'm so proud of you, and if you need the reminder: each moment is another chance at a new beginning, and it's never too late to choose yourself 🌷
