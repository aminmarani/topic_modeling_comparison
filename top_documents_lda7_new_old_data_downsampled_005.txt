Doc ID: 2447.0, distribution: 0.9935527355873949 ; Question: We do have semi-attached homes in the US called duplexes, but they're not terribly common and typically in lower income areas (in my experience at least). They are typically rentals as well, owned by one landlord and rented out to two people. How do you go about making shared repairs on the house with your neighbor (for example the roof)? Also what is a loft conversion? Answer: Each house is just responsible for their bit, so if our roof needed repairing we'd just do our side. If it affects both houses, we'd have to negotiate with our neighbours what to do, but usually we just take care of our own side.A loft conversion is when the top space of the house under the roof is converted from a dusty random space (often with a trapdoor for access and maybe used for storage) into usable rooms. We have a big bedroom and an en suite bathroom up here and it's lovely. It's generally cheaper than moving to a bigger house to get more space.

Doc ID: 4632.0, distribution: 0.9899157686065843 ; Non-negotiable weights  Despite (or maybe because of) the metaphorical landmines exploding💥, I think T is figuring out more and more how she can support me with my weight. We finally got to the point of me telling it to her each week, but that's brought up more issues - since now it's become available for discussion in therapy sessions, the risk of T saying something unintentionally unhelpful about it has also become available. Last session I was upset with her for not seeming to care that I was struggling to tell her my weight that week. I said to her then that I needed to feel that telling her it was non-negotiable. I only said it in passing, in the middle of lots of other stuff, but T clearly heard me because this week she was very firm about it. First she texted me just before my session this week “Hi Faith, could you text me your weight please”. I couldn't because I didn't know it, but I had been contemplating sulking and just not telling it to her anymore. So she sort of headed me off on that one and it felt good (safe, containing) that she had asked. In session we had a discussion about when I would weigh myself next (that evening). T said “Ok will you text it to me tomorrow morning then?”. I agreed but then added “…unless it's terrible”, by which I meant if it has either gone down or up an uncomfortable amount. T came back firmly with “Ah but you said you needed it to be non-negotiable, so text it whatever it is please”.  Clearly I know I could still choose to just not text her. She can't force me to tell her my weight. However I kind of like telling her my weight. It's helpful to me to put it out there between us so it's not just rolling around inside my head doing an unhealthy secrecy thing. I'm thankful that T is willing to support me in doing that, and I want to be willing to use her support.

okay wait no i have more to say 🙂 no bake treats are my favorite, and i really think this recipe makes my top  for that category 😛 not only is the texture perfect, the flavor will transcend you straight to your thanksgiving dinner table (which is where i want to be at all times tbh). i experimented with the frosting on these (its not white chocolate!) and now it's my new to go for all things no bake…find out what i did below ⬇️

no-bake high protein pumpkin spice cookie dough bites

- / cup nut butter of choice (i used cashew)
-  tbsp coconut sugar
-  tbsp maple syrup
- / cup pumpkin purée 
-  cup oat flour
- pinch of sea salt
- cinnamon
- pumpkin pie spice

mix the nut butter, coconut sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin purée together until smooth. add the flour and spices and mix until well-combined (may have to use your hands here until a dough forms). roll into balls and freeze for about an hour or until firm. topping is just two scoops of vanilla protein powder mixed with almond milk until desired consistency (mine was a bit thick but still runny) and chopped nuts. place back in the freezer to set! i like these best thawed for a minutes when they're soft!

i knew i had to make my own vegan version, and i'm so glad i did. this sandwich of the epitome of “simple is best”. just three main ingredients but they come together so well when paired between two toasty, warm slices of bread. i'm drooling just typing this hahaha.

i actually made this sandwich a few times with sourdough before turning to lavash and it truly elevated this sandwich by a mile. highly recommend!!

make sure to save this post for healthy and nourishing lunch inspo this week :) i love serving this chickpea mash with crackers for a high protein snack too… just saying.

viral vegan tunacado 

+ chickpea mash, tomato, avocado

start by brushing two slices of lavash with olive oil, then toasting until golden brown (i used the whole wheat one from trader joes).

while the lavash is toasting, make the chickpea mash.

chickpea mash:

- / cup rinsed and drained chickpeas, mashed 
- / cup non-dairy plain yogurt of choice (i used a chickpea based yogurt)
-  tbsp dijon mustard
- sea salt
- garlic powder
- fresh dill 

once the lavash is toasted and mash is made, assemble the sandwich (layer mash, avocado, and tomato), slice in half, and enjoy!

The media / internet has a good way of making us feel “flawed” or in need of fixing... So, I'll just be here sprinkling some reality on your feed because sometimes it's hard to snap out of all the noise, all the comparison, all the trends & all the things we feel like we should be doing. 

This is my WHY… I post this kind of content because the more we see it, the more we normalise it. If somebody sees me embracing the features that have always been branded as “bad” or “ugly”, then perhaps they'll feel less alone & it'll help them like themselves more too, perhaps they'll/you'll see that it's possible to find confidence in your skin without having to “perfect” your body first.

I mean no ill will to those who posted the videos shown in this, there's enough space for everyone's content & I recognise that people find inspiration in different types of content, but I think it's a great example of:
📱 what scrolling through social media can be like & how prevalent that kind of content/messaging is
📱 how often we can be caught in comparison or not feeling good enough
In short, I just want this corner of the internet to feel safe & make you feel good, instead of worse 🤝💗

I know I can't represent all body types, but I CAN showcase my reality & while I don't expect everyone to be able to relate or find value in my posts, I just want to be part of the change I wish to see in the world. 

I hope these lil doses of reality remind you that you don't have to look like ✨them✨ because being you is good enough 🌷

this isn't a ticket to do less ALL THE TIME cause we need some clean clothes and warm food in the house! but rather a call to notice when you start to resist “doing less”

is it scary? does it mean you're lazy? are you scared of the thoughts that might come up? are you worried people will think less of you?

these questions are good to ponder when you attempt to be less active, productive, etc. and it starts to feel extremely uncomfortable.

Doc ID: 2542.0, distribution: 0.9840905665940421 ; Having positive body image isn't believing your body looks good, it's believing your body IS good, regardless of how it looks! ✨

And when you start believing your body *is* good, it makes it a whole lot easier to feel more confident, comfortable & appreciative of that body. 

“But how do I start truly believing my body is good?” you might be wondering…

Well, your mind is a powerful tool. So when you declare something, your brain looks for evidence to confirm it. So if you declare: “I'm not good enough”, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative reinforcement & critical self-talk. But if you just shifted your mindset & put your energy into more positive thoughts instead, that could change your life.

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

The next time you speak down to yourself, know that ONLY YOU have the power to give yourself kindness & positivity. Your body image is a reflection of your mindset, it's influenced by what  you believe & all of the messages you tell yourself. Some of those messages will be influenced by external sources like the media, your family, friends etc but it's up to you whether you take those opinions on as your own.

For me, I'm no longer telling myself I'm only beautiful when I'm sucking in, hiding away & portraying perfection. I'm choosing to accept myself as I am & because of that, I'm constantly seeking everything in my life that reinforces that thought, I'm constantly seeking the magic in myself, and I believe it now, my body is good, it keeps me healthy & safe. It's my home 🥺

You have the power, never forget that 💛

Leave a “➕” in the comments if you're going to focus on positive reinforcement, positive affirmations & positive self-talk this week 🥰

How is it that in one photo I can have ab lines, yet a couple seconds later in the next I have a soft belly with rolls & folds?

How is it that in one photo I can have thick, luscious locks, yet in the next my hair is thinning with broken pieces all around my face?

Because as humans, our bodies move & change. We'll look different from time-to-time, photo-to-photo, angle-to-angle & pose-to-pose. AND, your body & appearance isn't always as you perceive it either.

That's exactly why you can't give your appearance so much power over your happiness, because it's forever changing. 

I put a poll up today on my stories & more than % of you said that you view your body as a “before” picture & that you believe there's an “after” body that will make you happier.

We are all our own harshest critics. But nobody (other than you) is looking over you with a microscope, nobody cares, everyone's too worried about themselves to worry about your big feet or broad shoulders or cellulite. 

There's no physical “after” or transformation that will cure your negative self-talk. No matter how beautiful or “perfect” you think someone is, there will be things they don't love about themselves too. Nobody is immune. Once we realise we're all in the same boat, the sooner we might stop giving so much power to the way that we look & start being kinder to ourselves instead. After all, no amount of self-improvement can make up for any lack of self-acceptance 💗

Me when I just relax & stand up straight: 🚪 

Anyone else? 🙊 [ad]

But if you only accept your body when it looks a certain way, that's not self love, that's self objectification.

It's so easy for us to judge ourselves against others, but it's so important to remember that comparing:
✨ yourself to others
✨ your posed body to your relaxed body
✨ your achievements, job, productivity, every day life to someone else's online highlight reel
is TORTURE… & hardly fair.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love social media — but there's no denying that most share their best life & best versions of themselves on here, so it makes sense that we'll find ourselves comparing ourselves & our lives while scrolling through. 

Here are some things that helped me stop comparing myself:

🦋 Their beauty and/or success doesn't take away from yours
🦋 Perfection is an illusion - we only see what someone wants us to see. The photos that are posted are only % of someone's life. There are  hours in each day, and we usually only see a few minutes of someone's life online. (Myself included)
🦋 Bad body image days happen to us all — so if you think weight loss or a makeover is going to magically fix that, you're in for a shock 🙈 finding peace with your body & appearance happens when you start working from the inside out ✨
🦋 We're all living on a different timeline. Mark Zuckerberg might've created his multi-million dollar company in his dorm room as a teen, but Vera Wang didn't design her first dress until . 
🦋 Beauty is subjective - you might not see your beauty, but you also don't see the way your eyes light up at the sight of puppies or sunsets, so how can you really ever know your true beauty when you've only ever seen yourself in a mirror or photos?

Happy Real Me Monday 🌻

Doc ID: 2517.0, distribution: 0.9800519641535272 ; Same workout, but different results… This is what changed 👇

I grew up fearing food, restricting it — then inadvertently overindulging, not understanding how the food I ate affected my body & constantly feeling guilty after eating. So I just wanted to leave this here in case you're feeling the same way. This is the difference your food intake can make…

On the left, I was working out at the gym BUT I wasn't giving my body enough fuel to build or even maintain my muscle mass, I felt weaker & hungrier.

On the right, I'm still resistance training the same amount of days per week BUT eating more, feeling stronger, I have more energy & give my body sufficient energy to build / maintain my muscle mass.

Without eating enough, your body can barely carry out its basic functions; breathing, brain function, pumping blood, digestion, etc… Let alone give you the energy to exercise, socialise, focus, laugh & enjoy life… Which are all things your body has the energy to do when you give it enough food to THRIVE on.

This isn't about one body type being better than the other, it's about the lifestyle FEELING better — having more food flexibility, not ignoring hunger cues, feeling stronger, enjoying life more. This is here to show you the difference fuelling your body properly can make 🥲

It isn't the enemy, it's ENERGY. 

It also goes to show that copying someone else's routine doesn't mean you'll have the same results as them! So many different factors are at play:

🍝 diet - the type of food you eat + the amount of food you eat
🧬 genetic makeup - some bodies are naturally leaner, some build muscle mass easier, some have longer torsos, wider hips, etc
🕺🏼 exercise - the intensity, frequency & type of exercise you do
💤 sleep / stress / etc — this varies for all of us. Even if we ate & exercised the same, we'd all look different. 

Moral of the story is… Your body can't run on an empty tank. Instead of focusing on how your body & life looks, think about how it FEELS 💗

 Tw! Weight talk I am afraid of gaining weight because of various reasons, but mostly because it will be seen by my brain as lack of control, but i know i need to and i fight against this mentality daily because: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

 NOTHING  WRONG WITH GAINING WEIGHT, no problemo at all, but some days, like today, it feels like there is and i get nervous and anxious about a future body where i weight  kilos more.  Days like these are really draining honestly, there's a pit in my stomach because i feel bad with myself because i only ate junk food or a thing with “way to many calories” and i have to constantly remind myself that:
a) IT DOESN´T MATTER, i am fine, i need those foods, i like those foods, therefore i eat them. 
b) The thought “one won't hurt” “this thing won't make me gain x kilos” is completely dumb. What if that item of food did make me gain a whole ten kilos? What about it? What's so wrong with it? 

I write it with no problem but accepting it is very hard, today i did well, i ate against my ed, but when a day like today hits where the more i eat the more anxious and self conscious i feel, i tend to avoid certain foods which is NOT OKAY, OKAY ME? There was a time in my life where eating junk food was another walk in the park, i miss those days and i want them back, so i have to continue with positive reaffirmations that i am valid and fine even after i ate those high caloric foods. 

At the end of the day, today was just a bad day, with really big victories!, but a bad day still, and like i said in a previous post i can't get mad at myself because recovery isn't linear and i am allowed to not feel my best all of the time. These feelings of self consciousness after eating “bad” food won't go away today, but if i reassure myself tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that, maybe they will :)

why? because once i began allowing myself to eat all foods (especially foods i used to think of as 'unhealthy'), i understood that i could have them whenever i wanted. this eliminated a scarcity mindset when it came to unhealthy food (in other words, “i have to have so much of it right now because i won't be allowed to have it again for x amount of time”). honoring my cravings for foods i used to restrict actually made them  way less intense, and simultaneously heightened my cravings for bowls like this one in between :)

all of this to address the countless comments and questions i get when it comes to intuitive eating— most popularly a fear that by allowing yourself to eat whatever you want, you'll “lose control”. i promise this isn't how it works. our bodies know what we need, and will always ask for those things. we just have to make sure we're listening <

if you watch my stories you'll know i share some version of this crispy quinoa and feta veggie bowl literally every single night without fail. it's my go-to dinner!! think low effort with high satisfaction. i change it up based on what veggies i have on hand but the gist is always the same.

i love creating intricate recipes but honestly by favorite meals have no recipes at all… like this one. just throw it all in the pan and trust that it'll be delicious. 

that being said, since there's no true recipe for this dish i'll leave some basic details below. i hope you try this out in some way! it's such an incredibly satisfying and flavorful dish :)

details:

- i start by sautéing the veggies i'm using on the stovetop. this night i used zucchini and broccoli (which i steamed first, as this is my favorite way to cook broccoli specifically). i added kale too!
- for the quinoa, i use microwavable packs! i'm huge on saving time in the kitchen when i can, and i honestly love tricks like this. there's nothing wrong or unhealthy about simple shortcuts :)
- the tofu i had prepped already! but i typically slice, toss in olive oil and spices, then bake for  min at F. then i broil for  min at F to get it extra crispy!
- the sauce i'm using the coat everything here is a whipped hummus and feta dip (i made this earlier in the day for another recipe i'm sharing soon, but basically it's hummus and feta blended together with some other spices— i'll share full details in another post)
- once you add the quinoa and feta (last step), you'll want to cook everything on high for about - min. this let's the quinoa get crispy in the melted cheese (a dream)!!!!
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

in a mixing bowl, combine the melted and cooled butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla. whisk by hand until uniform, then stir through the flour, oats, sea salt, cinnamon, and baking powder. once a sticky dough forms, stir in chopped chocolate and make sure it's mixed through completely. roll the dough into balls and place each cookie on a greased cookie sheet. flatten the cookies, then dollop a bit of nutella into the center of each one. use your hands to form the dough around the nutella and cover it completely, rolling back into a ball shape with this in the center. place back on the sheet, flatten, and repeat for each cookie. bake for - minutes at F or until golden brown.

Doc ID: 6938.0, distribution: 0.9851730796667185 ; you're looking at the easiest work day lunch 🙆🏻‍♀️ in my opinion, the secrets to any truly satisfying lunch bowl is a hearty base (quinoa here), a satiating protein (chickpeas), and a magical dressing (this garlic tahini one changed my life… lol). i like to use whatever veggies i have on hand by roasting them in big batches at the beginning of the week to build bowls with each day. im definitely team no boring bowls— anyone else? 👀

romaine, steamed quinoa, roasted zucchini, chickpeas, garlic tahini dressing

dressing is just  tbsp tahini, garlic powder, sea salt,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp water all mixed up/stirred until uniform. add more water if you want this thinner! it's my go-to dressing for everything :)
