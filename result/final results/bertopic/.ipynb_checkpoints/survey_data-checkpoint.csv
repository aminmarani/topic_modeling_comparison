1,1,eating,Its been a day of random eating and a weekend of eating what I wanted and enjoying my food. This evening I went for a swim and weighed myself. What is this magic? I was still in the same 1-2lb range. It’s hard to believe that my weight can just stay here without me having to work hard at it or focus on it every minute of the day.,eat,"eating disorders are complicated. they don’t exist in a vacuum. what feels like an incredibly intimate battle is the opposite. when you’re sick, every person in your life is too. nobody is untouched by your pain. and this is the heaviest burden.

i was 13 years old when my relationship with food, exercise, and my body turned toxic. i was an older sister, a daughter, a best friend, a teammate. yet all i ever thought about was me. i planned every meal out for weeks in advance. i wondered how many calories i burned walking to class. i tugged at the waistband of the jeans sliding off my hips, wanting more of me to disappear when there was nothing to spare. 

my sisters, my parents, my best friend, my teammates and coaches- they fell to the outskirts of my life. i had no time in my day to uphold relationships. how could i? when i passed every waking second running circles in my mind over a scoop of peanut butter i ate last week?

i isolated myself. my eating disorder was safe when nobody was around to challenge it. nobody to ask, “didn’t you already work out today?” or “why aren’t you eating?” or “are you okay?”. in the beginning i missed these people. i missed their love. but my ED promised me great things in their absence, so i let them go. 

i actively struggled with my ED for 5 years. 5 years of pain and misery and throwing fits and screaming matches. 5 years of running away from dinners in public. 5 years of skipping my sisters’ recitals and games, because i would be forced to eat or miss a workout. 5 years of projecting pain onto everyone, even though at the time this never crossed my mind. 

i thought because i physically isolated myself, that my ED was contained. but it spread like wildfire. i only know this in hindsight, and it hurts, to see colors where i only saw black and white. 

my family and friends hurt deeply for me. with me. my mom used to always say a mother is only as happy as her saddest child. to this day that moves me to tears. 

we never hurt alone, even if we try our best to do just that. if you can’t bring yourself to heal for YOU, then at the very least do it for someone else. i promise they feel your pain.",healthy,"Question: Do eating disorder thoughts still take up a lot of brain space and make you feel bad? What does that 95% stability look like and mean for you? I'm so hopeless about ever getting the thoughts to go even if physically I'm better now  Answer: Eating disorder thoughts still come and go. However they don’t take up much brain space and they generally don’t make me feel bad. I spot them for what they are and I reassure myself with a healthy thought.95% stability means 95% of my life feels recovered to me. 5% of me still does some disordered things which I ideally wouldn’t do, but I can live with them. Most of the time I eat regularly, adequately and flexibly. I’ve worked through so many behaviours and negative thought patterns in therapy that if any of them start, I can hear my therapist’s voice on that particular topic and I can channel it to take charge of my eating disorder tendencies.It’s not been a quick process and it’s taken a lot of effort and repetition and patience and hard work in therapy (by both T and me), plus lapses and steps backwards and ruptures. But gradually gradually it all starts to come together. I think an important thing is finding someone you can work through the thoughts with, even after you’re physically better. The thoughts hang around in your head if you can’t process through them, so saying them out loud to someone and being in a place in your relationship with that person that you are willing to allow their responses to change your brain is really healing and is a key to neural rewiring.",food,"“I’d be so much happier if I looked like ✨them✨”… Don’t worry bestie, they don’t always look like the social media version of themselves either. I’m living proof of that 👀

The truth is, they have days where they feel like crap too. They have things they don’t like about themselves. They see themselves under the same harsh microscope that we all view ourselves under.

And when you’re having a hard time with your body image, you’re more likely to feel:
unmotivated, unhappy, negative, antisocial, unfulfilled, anxious to leave the house, unloveable, short-tempered, self-saboting, like you don’t want to eat well or workout… Because you’re coming from a place of hate, instead of love.

We always believe that in order to feel good, we have to CHANGE ourselves on the outside.

But you’re actually more likely to workout, eat well, be happy, confident, reach whatever goals you have & be motivated in life if you work on improving your body image instead! (not your body)

People with a positive body image are more likely to have good physical & mental health, because instead of punishing yourself with unrealistic, restrictive lifestyle changes & unkind thoughts that could lead to mental health conditions, such as EDs & depression, you’re more likely to WANT to look after your body in more sustainable, balanced ways.

The goal is not to change your body, it’s to change your mindset. When you do that, the rest will flow so effortlessly.

How does social media make you feel about yourself? Leave a 😍 if it makes you feel good & a 😵‍💫 if it leaves you feeling worse. Curate your space, your mental wellness is so important! Keep making choices for yourself out of love, you’ve got this! 💗

See, the eating disorder behaviors are in line with messages I was given over the years by various people in my life telling me that I was unworthy, dirty, and broken. That I don’t deserve to take up space or have a voice or be seen. These messages came from outside of me and, not knowing any better, I internalized them as my own. When I destroy my body, I am taking on those people’s truths about who I am – and subsequently giving away all of my power to those people. And quite frankly, I am really freaking tired of being owned by other people. They don’t deserve to have that kind of control over my life. They don’t deserve to have their words and their beliefs holding power over my mind and my actions. When I use the eating disorder, my depression and hopelessness skyrocket because I am out of line with my values and beliefs, suppressing my Real Self and living in other people’s truths again. When I bring my behaviors in sign with my soul, the deepest, truest parts of me, the internal chaos and pain quiets down a little bit. It’s not easy by an means and it’s a battle everyday, but I want my power back. I want a life that is my own, not anyone else’s.",feel,"at 15 years old, i had to relearn nearly everything i knew about being human.
.
my eating disorder had turned me into a zombie, a machine. it drained me like a parasite. it stripped me of every last touch of life. i was empty, always empty. .
so when i finally began a true recovery, i had to leave this behind.
.
i had to relearn the simple things. how to walk across a room without growing lightheaded. how to climb stairs without taking a break to sit after each ascent upward. how to sit in a chair without my tailbone screaming with agony.
.
i had to relearn the things that human beings naturally seek out for their well-being. how to eat without a demon in my ear insisting i would self-combust for doing so. how to stay put when an anxiety attack whirled inside my stomach. why? because my sisters got to go for runs and my teammates got to go to practice and me? i wasn’t allowed to exercise for months.
.
i had to relearn the things that take you from existing to living. how to laugh again. how to accept an invitation for a meal out, one i couldn’t control, in order to mend broken relationships. how to follow my heart instead of my hyper-structured schedule. how to say yes, yes, yes to everything my eating disorder would have never allowed.
.
i had to relearn how to be selfless. how to heal myself so those who loved me could sleep at night. how to accept my body for how it looked and what it could do because it deserved better than a voice in my head. how to skip the gym, have a second lunch, embrace schedule changes in order to accommodate others in my life.
.
and i’m still learning. i’m learning how to love, how to receive love. how to accept. accept the life i’ve been given, the body i have, the way i look. how to be kind, how to stay stronger than the fleeting whispers of a disordered behavior from lifetimes ago. how to keep going when it feels crippling to do so.
.
recovery from an eating disorder is a lifelong pursuit, an intimate and emotional endeavor to find peace in your own heart. it is hard, it is taxing…but it is stabilizing, it is rewarding. it is the most humbling challenge i will ever take on, and for that i’m deeply grateful.",body,"fit-daydreams: 

You’ve wanted a flat stomach forever. You’ve wanted to binge for 10 minutes. Your choice.",weight,"Is it a normal sisterly thing for her to go out if her way to point out my weight? She could be doing that thing where she’ll do anything to point out a flaw because she’s “ashamed to see” me walking about how I look. I don’t know why my looks are such a big deal to her but she definitely doesn’t help me, in fact, she is one of the causes of my ed and depression. I don’t think that’s a healthy sister relationship.",yourself,"I ate a croissant (amongst other things) at breakfast this morning. No big deal. Quietly proud of myself.  Eating disorder recovery has been a long journey but thanks to my therapist I have a really solid foundation now and even though there’s maybe 5% of me still wobbly and making the occasional bad decision, the other 95% of me can deal with that and stay steady.",being,"You have a disease, so give yourself some compassion. Yes, you can learn to manage the symptoms of your disease, but you didn’t cause the disease to develop. Stop carrying the weight of that belief. It’s too heavy for you."

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
extra nutty and seedy chocolate chunk banana breads:
*inspired by the mediterranean banana bread recipe found on @mindbodygreen ! * 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1/3 cup maple syrup * 2 eggs
* 2 large bananas
* 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
* 1/4  cup coconut milk,
* pinch of baking soda
* pinch of sea salt
* pinch of cinnamon
* splash of vanilla
* 2 cups almond flour
* 2 tbsp coconut flour
* chocolate chunks
* slivered almonds
* cacao nibs
* sunflower seeds  set the oven to 350. mix oil, syrup, and eggs in a bowl until well combined. in a separate bowl mash the bananas and applesauce. pour the egg mixture into the bananas and stir thoroughly. add all of dry ingredients (minus chocolate, nuts, seeds, and nibs) and stir until well combined. stir through chocolate chunks, then pour batter into a greased mini loaf pan. top each loaf with remaining ingredients and bake for 40-50 minutes. let cool completely before serving! . . .. #healthyfood #healthy #foodie #cleaneats #foodblogger  #wellness #fitness #healthyinspo #healthylife #glutenfree #grainfree #paleo #healthymeals #plantpower #thenewhealth #mbg #food52grams #thefeedfeed #thefeedfeedbaking  #glutenfree #healthybakingrecipe #chocoalte #bananabread",baking,"out of all the sweet treat recipes i make, this one is definitely my boyfriend’s favorite. he requests them *at least* once a week without fail hahaha. they’re THAT good. truly such a simple and easy recipe but it always hits the spot. think your favorite cookie dough from childhood but with ingredients that leave you feeling way better (but still just as satisfied in my opinion)!

tip for these— use a chopped chocolate bar as opposed to chocolate chips. i can’t explain how much this elevates the eating experience but trust me, it’s a game changer. hope you love these as much as we do :) 

peanut butter chocolate chunk cookie dough bites

ingredients:

- 1/2 cup creamy salted peanut butter
- 3 tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup vanilla protein powder of choice
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- chocolate of choice (chopped)
 directions:

- combine everything (except for the chocolate chunks) in a bowl and mix until a uniform dough forms. fold the chocolate through the batter, roll into balls, and set in the fridge to set (about 20 minutes). the amount will depend on how big you roll the dough out into, but i usually get 10-12!

Ingredients: Rolled oats, maca powder, ground flaxseed, thiccccc coconut yoghurt (I use the mango and passion fruit flavour by @coconutcollab), plant milk (I use unsweetened soya) and any toppings you desire 🫐🍓
-
Method: I always soak my rolled oats before I use them, and usually overnight because it means they’re easier to digest (but you can do this literally like 15 minutes beforehand and it still works 😉). Don’t judge me, but I soak my oats in a mug and add just enough water to cover them. When I’m then actually making my oats I’ll add the soya milk, flaxseed, maca powder and a good heaping spoonful of coconut yoghurt. Mix everything really well, drizzle with nut butter and add anything else you like on top ✌🏻
-
I don’t measure things but this is what I roughly do: 1 cup oats, 1 tsp maca powder, 1 tbsp ground flaxseed, 1 large spoonful of coconut yoghurt, add enough plant milk until it’s a consistency you like . . . unlimited toppings, of course 😆

Hot oats are just not my thing at the moment and I much prefer them cold, I don’t know if anyone else feels the same?

- chocolate chips/chopped chocolate for mixing in

preheat oven to 350 and prepare a brownie tin. add all of the ingredients to a blender (except chocolate) and blend until a thick, uniform batter forms. will be very thick but this is fine! stir through the chocolate by hand and transfer dough to the brownie tin. bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. they’ll be soft in texture (like an under baked cookie). i let mine cool completely in the fridge for an hour or two before slicing. you can heat the bars up in the microwave if you’d like to eat them warm, but they’re delicious cold too :)

- sea salt

top layer: 
- 1 cup chocolate of choice melted with 1 tbsp coconut oil

directions:

line a cupcake tin with liners, then fill each one with the chocolate from the bottom layer. i fill my liners 1/3 of the way up. place in the freezer to set for a few minutes while you assemble the peanut butter layer. combine all of those ingredients until a thick, uniform dough forms. roll into balls and flatten into discs. remove the cupcake tin from the freezer and place each peanut butter disc on the bottom hardened layer. pour the final layer of chocolate over top and make sure cup is covered completely. place in freezer to set for a few hours or overnight. best enjoyed slightly thawed from the freezer or even heated in the microwave for 20 seconds to soften up!

3,3,therapy,"Therapy 3.12.19 // writing the story  T said hi in quite a gentle tone of voice and I said hi back, and she said, here we are again. She asked me if I was ok, because she said I seemed a bit flat. I said no I’m ok. I was suddenly a bit tearful because it felt like she’d said hi so gently, as if she knew it was going to be a tough session, and the quietness in her voice caught me a bit unexpectedly.  “Do you have any things to talk about on your list today?” I shook my head “Ok so shall we talk about this story that you sent me?” I nodded and T pulled across a print out of it she had right there next to her. “How did it feel to write this?” “Uh…. well I didn’t set out to write that, what it turned out to be. I sat down to try and put into words something I had been thinking about.” “Ok, what were you trying to write?” “Uh… so at the end of last session, I said [insert a slightly confused and jarbled retelling of the conversation], and I think up till then I’d felt like you were kind of neutral on what went on in my childhood. Like, maybe those things happened but they probably weren’t really a big deal. But when you said what you said, I felt like you were on my side and maybe you did think some of the things that happened were wrong….” I tailed off, and T spoke up “Yes, you’re right. I do think some of the things were wrong” “Oh. Um so I was thinking about that and trying to put into words something about, uh, so I see families and children who come into foster care, and they generally have similarities in the situations of the families. Like they’re often struggling with money, one or both parents not working, relationship breakdown, complicated situations… and things go on at home that I think almost everyone would agree was wrong. And I was thinking I would say it’s wrong for those children to be subjected to those things. But it’s hard to think that maybe things - not so extreme, but still things - were going on in my family when it was not that sort of situation at all…. So I sat down to write that, but then when I started typing, I wrote that story instead.”",therapist,"Soooo tired. On my third cup of coffee (and the first was a double).  I just want my therapist. Something triggered the longing, but I can’t remember what right this minute. And then because I’m tired and just want to be looked after for a moment instead of doing all the looking after, the longing continued.  I’m trying to validate my feelings. It’s ok to feel like this, I know it’s because I’m feeling a bit emotionally and physically worn out. I’m thinking of the nurturing things T has said to me in the past and I’m telling myself them again. I know if I reached out to her she would reply, but I’m not in crisis so I think I can get my adult self to take care of little me - while still accepting that it’s ok to wish T were here to do it.  Times like this bring up the paradox and limits of the therapy relationship. I had to get attached to my therapist in order to let my defences down and do the deep healing work. But then that attachment only gets seen for 50 mins a week, and the rest of the week I have to cope with it on my own *sigh*. Not fair.",talking,"Therapy 05.05.20 // after the bombshell  I managed to not completely shut down. T explained that she’d put a statement on her website about not taking new clients - she wondered if I’d seen it - and she just felt very aware that it was out there but it had gone unspoken between us, and so she wanted to bring it up so we could talk about it.  I had seen her statement, but I’d presumed she just wasn’t taking any new clients during lockdown because it was difficult to start a new therapeutic relationship online. So I hadn’t thought about it any further than that.  T then said lots of lovely things to me. I don’t know if you’d call it damage limitation, but it was like she’d dropped this bombshell about retiring on me, and now she was quickly trying to catch me before I fell.  “I will never forget you Faith. You will always have a place in my heart. I really enjoy working with you. I do! I never think, oh no I have to see Faith today. You work so hard in therapy and you are always thinking… working on things. I know it’s a therapeutic relationship that we have, but you can’t have a real therapeutic relationship without having some elements of a normal relationship too. That’s the privilege of a therapeutic relationship. In fact, it can be deeper than a normal relationship because you have the boundaries in place to make it safe to go deeper than you usually would be able to.” I listened to her and tried to let myself absorb all her words. The battle between shutting down or staying present was still going to and fro inside me. Gradually as she kept talking, repeating the same things, her voice soothed me and I started to feel calmer internally. After T had stopped talking, there was a pause. “So, what’s going on in your head now?” I think I said something about how at least if T made the decision to end therapy, then I wouldn’t feel regret for ending therapy myself. What if I decided to end, and then something happened and I needed T again. I’d be kicking myself. Whereas this way I would know I’d had no choice. T squinted at me and said she wasn’t sure that was very therapeutic. To be honest, I think I felt a little bit gleeful. Maybe it’s not therapeutic but it’s what you’ve done T. I said I felt a little bit stubborn, “Well, now I don’t have to make the decision myself about when to end”. T looked at me thoughtfully and said “hmm I think that’s important… I’m not sure right now quite how, I’ll have to have a think about it…”  We were coming to the end of the session and T said “I get the feeling that you were about an 8 or a 9 in terms of having a wobble when I told you, but how would you feel now?” I considered, “Maybe a 4 or 5” “Ok that’s good, it’s come down a bit then. Was I accurate in saying an 8 or a 9?” “Uh… yes… and I was having a wobble too in that I was nearly shutting down…. A few years ago I would have completely shut down for the rest of the session if you told me something like that. But I managed not to today.” T smiled and said I had done really well and it was good that I had noticed how much progress I had made.",talk,And now we’re on our way to drop d1 at university for the first time 😥 allll the emotions,felt,"Question: So I have a question.  Do you ever feel like there's two versions of you in therapy (adult vs child) and that they're responding two different ways?  I emailed my therapist that I had made the dean's list (3.5+ GPA (Or A-B average)) this semester and she told me that I did really good and that that was amazing.  The week before (we're every other week right now and I see her Tuesday) we talked about how I have such a hard time with praise (can't be praised/praise myself for what is 'expected' of me because parents always discounting my achievements, etc (long trauma history for me of emotional abuse from them, some still ongoing).  My adult self didn't respond to her email but tonight I'm feeling very emotional and vulnerable and I want to send her an email apologizing and saying she shouldn't have responded because I'm supposed to make dean's list and that I'm sorry for bothering her and that I'm sorry if I'm too much.  Adult me stopped me from sending it.  What do I do?  Do I send the email?  Why do I feel like this?  It feels so stupid. Answer: Hi anon, sorry I know I am very slow replying to this message. What did you do? Did you send the email?Yes I very often feel like there’s two versions of me in therapy, the adult and the child. Sometimes when T is saying something to me that makes my adult self squirm or want to discount, such as praise, I try and quiet that part of my mind and think “let the child in me hear this”. And I sit and listen and absorb what T is saying and believe that some part of me deep down is taking it in even if that other noisy bit of my brain is thinking bah! this isn’t for you! It’s kind of like stepping out of my own way and letting T in to do stuff in my brain. A person has to build up enough trust in their therapist to allow them to do that though.We feel like this because as children we got wrong or mixed messages that we made sense of the best way we could but that weren’t right. Now those beliefs aren’t serving us well and can get in our own way, so if we want to be free to live more authentic lives we need to undo those false beliefs and replace them with true ones.",think,"And I wonder whether when I suddenly shut down after what I said last therapy session, whether I displaced my anger at my parents onto T. Since she is a safe person to be angry at.",feel,Question: So nice of you to send your daughter to a sleepover sick like that and spread it to all of her friends.  Answer: Have you ever encountered 13 year olds? I didn’t “send” d3 anywhere. I actually tried to talk her into staying home because I was worried she’d be ill in the night again.,her,"Therapy 16.02.21 // final part  Towards the end of the session, I got suddenly sad and overwhelmed and said to T that it makes me sad that she can never know everything about my childhood. That no matter how many stories I tell her, there will always be more and there will always be a balance between good times and bad times that is just impossible to recreate accurately. Partly because I can never tell her everything and partly because even the things I tell her are remembering through the eyes of myself as a child. T nodded and said that was true.  We were out of time to take it any further. While I was still sat contemplating what I’d just said, T said “let’s have a mad five minutes to finish and talk about lighter things”. I looked at her and she started talking about the snow. I tried to lift my brain to engage with her but it was a struggle I didn’t really win. I let T ramble on and then we scheduled for next week. When we logged off I was still a bit zoned out and the unhappiness with what T had said was starting to surface, so I just said bye and clicked off.",she,"Therapy 08.09.20 // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I’d just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it’s really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn’t have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it’s been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you’re ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that’s hard for you to answer because you don’t know what I’m going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it’s so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it’s just what you’ve always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn’t sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.",shes,"Question: I messaged you awhile back about having to end therapy with my T who I've seen for years and I felt hurt because I thought she didn't care about me. Well she gave me a rock that her daughter painted with the things that make her happy and she wrote the words hope, belief & strength, representing me and our therapy. I read her a letter I'd written and after I'd flown home, she emailed me letting me know how touched she was by it. Anyway all this to say that I really miss her and my heart aches  Answer: It’s ok to miss her. But I’m glad you had a good ending. And you have your rock from her and the email about your letter. Not the same as having her, I know, but remember that everything she taught you and everything you talked about is inside you now so she will always be a part of you. I know she will remember you after seeing you for so long and she will think about you.Let yourself have your feelings and your heart ache. It’s understandable that you’re sad and a bit broken-hearted about ending. Remember all the good moments from therapy and treasure them. And sometimes you just have to distract yourself and try and get busy with some nice activity to help yourself get through the most painful times. Take care xx"

Your worth & happiness doesn’t increase if others think you are: beautiful, productive, successful, rich, the best or the smartest.

What matters isn't what your life looks like. It's what your life FEELS like. It’s what YOU think of you.

Whenever I’ve had a bad body image day (or negative self-talk day) it’s usually triggered by a single negative thought that snowballs into more… For e.g. let’s say you’re scrolling through social media comparing yourself to someone — from that single negative thought, the floodgates open… 

Now you have two choices, you can 1️⃣ acknowledge the way you’re speaking to yourself, nip it in the bud & consciously choose to fill your mind with kinder thoughts

OR 2️⃣ you can lean into that judgemental voice, continue to sabotage yourself, let those feelings fester & leak into other aspects of your life.

The way you speak to yourself matters!!! YOU have the power to choose which path you take. This is a concept I never really knew existed until I started taking back that power & respecting myself (& my body) more. It didn’t come naturally at first, but the more you consciously lean into those gentler thoughts, the easier it becomes to protect your peace & create a safe space in your own mind.

I also understand that sometimes we need extra support or guidance… Sometimes it feels impossible to see the positives & it’s NOT your fault. You don’t have to tackle these thoughts alone. Seeking help is incredibly brave. If you’re not sure where to start, here are some great services that may be able to support you:

this is why negative self-talk is so powerful.

this is why positive self-talk is so powerful.

we have control over our own narrative.

positive self-talk helped me heal. for years i repeated short mantras to myself on a daily basis. words i believed were untrue but spoke to myself anyway. i remember crying alone in bathroom stalls in high school, telling myself i was strong, telling myself i was worthy of healing. i didn’t believe these sentiments at the time. but i spoke them anyway.

i remember standing in the mirror as a teen- always standing in the mirror. analyzing myself from every angle. criticizing the way my body folded and creased, where it held weight and the shapes it didn’t have. i told myself i loved my body for what it allowed me to do and not for how it looked. i didn’t believe these sentiments at the time. but i spoke them anyway.

we grow to believe the words we repeat to ourselves. today i know i am strong and worthy of healing. today i know i love my body for what it allows me to do and not for how it looks. i laid a foundation of positive self-talk for years. it is what grounds me today. i whole-heartedly believe in things i never thought could be true. 

consistency. repetition. commitment. 

self-love. self-respect. self-care. 

🖤🌱🖤🌱🖤🌱🖤",feel,"these pictures are taken one year apart. aside from the fact that i’m still living in sweatshirts (🤠) a lot has changed.

when i posted the second photo last year, everything was unknown. i left school thinking i’d be home for a week or two. i had no idea how heavy the world would become for months, for a year. i had no idea that that my life as i knew it and the plans i had for the future would both be flipped upside down.

i remember taking that photo and feeling afraid. and i still am, afraid, sometimes. but hardship makes us stronger. i took the first photo today and felt changed. refreshed. like i’ve let go of so much.

this past year i’ve:

- finally closed doors on experiences that no longer serve me
- leaned deeply into relationships, and accepted that the need to be supported is not a weakness but a strength
- taken control over my own narrative, and chosen to see rejection as redirection
- worked on feeling secure in my person, my skin, and my beliefs

time heals. it really does. i think back to this time last year- i don’t have everything figured out now, but i have found peace in places where i never thought possible. i’ll always have work to do. we’re always healing. change doesn’t always have to be obvious or out loud. 

these pictures look similar but are deeply different. the internal work is the hardest. it’s also the most rewarding. this year has been tough but i’ve found room to grow.  i’m proud of that. i have ways to go but ive also come far. 

i’m excited to meet the person i’ll be next year, and the next, and the next 🦋🦋 taking a few minutes to reflect like this every so often is so healing for me 🙏",work,"i woke up this morning and swung my feet over the side of my bed. they hit the ground and i was overcome with a crippling need for change. i can’t explain it any other way. a wave, washing over. it was only a few minutes later that i realized today’s date was september first. a coincidental, subconscious pull toward new beginnings.

a friend recently asked me where i believed my life was at in the current moment. am i at the beginning of a new chapter? in the midst of one? i replied that i feel so close to the end of a chapter but can’t seem to close it out. i feel as if i’ve done all the work possible in my power to turn a new page, but the deciding factor relies on forces out of my control. i feel a touch stuck, a bit defeated, and somewhat directionless.

this is hard to admit, but there’s strength in vulnerability. by recognizing these unsettling truths i can address them. i can see rejection as redirection. i can redefine concepts like “success”, “worth”, and “accomplishment”. i can begin to change little details in my life to feel something new, while i wait on the big changes to find their way to me.

this morning i replaced the set of necklaces i wear daily with a fresh new set. i picked up a non-fiction read to break my several-month long streak of fiction stories. i decided to try a new meal for breakfast, and added some stretches to my morning routine. these are simple ways to shake up my world, but they are adding up. 

as we move into fall i’m learning this season all over again. this is my first year out of school. my first year not returning to the life i’ve known for so long. i’m learning how to navigate this uncertain time. i’m learning to accept that i can’t control everything, and to not get frustrated so easily.

it’s a process, and it’s not easy, but it’s crucial.",you,"in 2020 i’m not hoping for good things, i’m working for them.
.
.
i’m not huge into new year’s resolutions (i feel people tend to get hung up on them), but i do have big plans for this year. i’ll be starting a new job. i’ll be graduating college. i’ll be developing heartfelt projects beyond my instagram. i’ll be working with some of my favorite brands. i’ll be traveling more. i’ll be paying extra attention to the quality of my relationships and to being present. i’ll be doing my best to love myself. .
.
aaaaand i think i’ll be taking myself out to brunch a bit more often. there’s something about being served pancakes that makes them taste ten times better, no?
.
.
here’s to another year of growth ✨",im,"i reflect a lot.
.
.
self-reflection is second nature for me, a habit. i lay in bed each night and play the day over in my head, then the week, the month, the year. .
.
in my 21 years i’ve changed drastically, in many ways. i went from a healthy and blissful child to an ill and depressed adolescent. i spent my early teens recovering and relapsing. i spent my late teens stabilizing. .
.
and now, here we are. early twenties. growing.
.
.
so you see, a lot of change. plenty of identities, plenty of lifestyles, plenty of beliefs and values. .
.
given my history i’m very in touch with who i am and the many selves i’ve been. as the new year approaches i’m not undergoing a huge reflective process, because this is something i engage in daily.
.
.
but i will mention this: 2019 hurt me. i don’t say that out of self-pity, or sadness, but rather from a place of neutral observation. 2019 hurt me. this pain propelled me into a self-healing journey that i would have never pushed myself toward on my own. .
.
in 2019 i challenged myself on all fronts; in my work, in my education, in my relationships and social life and, most importantly, in self-discovery. i grew a whole damn lot. as the year drifts off i feel a deeper sense of purpose. of pleasure. of power. .

8,8,inpatient,Day 5 of inpatient wasn’t great. I slept for most of the morning and then had a family meeting. The meeting was okay but I have to decide whether or not to go back to school and I don’t know what to do. I wanted to slee all day but I pushed myself to go on a walk instead. My friends and I got yelled at by another patient because we were reading the newspaper and he got angry of us for talking about trump and Iran because he’s a trump supporter. It was scary and now I’m scared to leave my room. I ended up staying in my room for most of the night and going to bed early. I got woken up to take my meds and then played cards with my friends for a bit.,hospital,Day 57 of inpatient started out really shitty but got a lot better. I woke up late and went back to bed immediately after meeting with the weekend doctor and taking care of ADLs. My dogs were going to visit today but I got dropped a level bc of self harm and other stuff so they couldn’t come. That made me upset so I stayed in bed for the whole day shift and barely talked to anyone. I had a visitor and that was nice. My day started to get better after that. I spent the rest of the day playing games with friends and that was fun.,treatment,Day 14 of inpatient was bad. I had a bad morning and slept until the afternoon. I had a bad evening too. My mood was really low and my anxiety was bad. I don’t know why things are getting worse. Oh well.,patients,Day 59 of inpatient was mixed. I didn’t sleep well last night (as usual) and I woke up feeling super anxious for no reason. They wouldn’t give me my anxiety meds because my blood pressure was too low and that made me more anxious. I slept for most of the morning but got out of bed for the afternoon. I played games and did puzzles and that was fun. The night got worse and I just feel like garbage.,day,Day 13 of inpatient was bad. I got woken up early by my doctor and that put me in a bad mood. I was pretty anxious all day bc I had a pass with my parents. The pass went okay but I felt pretty crappy after. It was just a bad day.,slept,Day 12 of inpatient was mixed. The morning and afternoon weren’t great. I slept in late and didn’t go to many of the groups. I stayed in my room for a lot of the day and I had really bad anxiety for most of it. One of the other patients was yelling at the staff and kicking things and men yelling is a trigger for me so that was difficult. Things got a lot better at night. I spent time with my friends and with staff and it was just really fun and a nice distraction. It’s weird how normal things feel here. Sometimes I forget that I’m in a psych hospital.,anxious,Day 10 of inpatient was ok. I woke up late and felt ok. A family friend visited and that was really nice. The day got worse after that and I just started feeling sad about all the things I’m missing out on. It just kind of all hit me that all my friends are doing things and living their lives and accomplishing things while I’m stuck here. I don’t know. It just bummed me out.,mood,Day 9 of inpatient was pretty bad. I woke up a lot later than usual because my anxiety medication made me really tired. I wasn’t able to go on any of the walks today because the staff didn’t think I was safe to go. They made me stay in open areas the whole day and I was so bored. My aunt and my parents visited and it didn’t go well. It was fine with my aunt but my parents said that I would have to pay for residential treatment. I was already having a bad depression day and that just made me feel worse. I already feel like a burden to them and that just made me feel bad. I was able to spend some time with friends and that made me feel better.,today,Day 7 of inpatient started out really bad but got better at night. I got woken up by my treatment team and I was super groggy for awhile. A lot of shit went down today with other patients and some of it was triggering so my anxiety was bad. My depression was also really bad today and I spent most of the afternoon/evening in my room. I eventually felt a little better and hung out with my friends. We listened to music and played cards and ordered ice cream and it was fun. It’s my friend’s last night and I’m happy for her but it’s hard to see all my friends go home while I’m still here.,going,Day 4 of inpatient was mostly good. I got moved up to level 2 so I was finally allowed to go on walks. I spent a lot of time with friends today and that was nice but it kind of all hit me at night and I just ended up being exhausted and feeling crappy. I’m just having a lot of really negative thoughts and I can’t make them stop.

10,10,fostering,The babies are here ❤️❤️ The day has been mad but they are so precious and lovely. Sitting here enjoying newborn snuggles. 1yr old asleep upstairs. Baby stuff all over the house. Proper unpacking has not yet happened.,adoption,So it turns out that even though H is off work for the four day weekend we can’t share the baby care because the baby likes no one but me,babies,Good news: the baby seems to have read the book that from six weeks she should cry less 👍,adopters,H said he is going to go outside and tidy his shed but now he is sitting around drinking coffee instead and I need him to go because I need to look at things in private for therapy tomorrow,foster,"Melllllting   Oh my goodness what a hot day it’s been! H got up at 5.20am as he had to go to London for work. The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn’t have to get up with them till 7.15am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn’t back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d1 and then d2 went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d3 a lift to her friend’s house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I’m really limited with what I can do with the babies so it’s mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H’s car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I’ve spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It’s a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He’ll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn’t been driving all day already. I’m really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I’m praying he makes it safely back. I’m off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.",birth,"Question: how was the night with the babies?  Answer: It was about as good as it could get really. The 1 yr old slept 12 hours straight through, and the newborn woke every 3 hours for feeds but then settled back to sleep afterwards. No complaints about that here. It was a shock to us to all be up at 7am though, none of us have been out of bed that early for many months. Even d2 and d3 got up and came out of their rooms at the first cries because they wanted to play with the babies.",baby,she sit in my lap. this was taken sometime in the summer,parents,Baby’s inner monologue: No bouncy chair! No baby gym! No Moses basket! No mobile! ONLY BLANKET! No H! No d1! No d2! No d3! ONLY FAITH!,child,"Question: So good to hear that your daughter's results were okay and that the little baby has a loving new home. It sounds like you deserve a good rest after all that! Answer: Thankyou…. the good rest has started, I have barely moved off the sofa all day.",children,"It’s been a very loooong day. Toddler only slept for 45 minutes all day, which was entirely used up having a planning meeting. So basically non stop. We went to the park this afternoon and got hailed on. Baby continues to be a dream. Did bedtime with toddler, cooked tea (smokey beans and halloumi, thankyou gousto), ate tea then passed out on the sofa for 45 mins. Brain cannot even think straight at this point. Goodnight."
11,11,covid,"*eyes rolling so hard*  At my monthly work support group this week, they asked for suggestions for what we’d like to happen at next year’s support groups. We wrote down our suggestions and emailed them. Here’s their reply to my suggestion that we, a group of people who work with children 24/7, should have a session dedicated to practicing and refreshing our knowledge on CPR: “We offer CPR training on our 3-yearly first aid course. There’s currently no dates out for this course. So we won’t be practicing this in support groups.” Isn’t there a flaw in that logic somewhere?? Besides the fact that everyone can ALWAYS benefit from practicing CPR.  I’m so mad I’ve had to get a glass of wine to calm down.",lockdown,"Yesterday was a painful afternoon at the vaccine clinic. I have to remind myself I’m being paid quite well to just sit there and enter data and tolerate the vaccinator even when they’re driving me up the wall. I’ve done data entry for a different vaccinator every shift so I’ve seen how they several different ones work, which ones I feel are doing it well and which ones aren’t. So when I get stuck with a realllly slowwww one, or one that forgets to say a load of important stuff, I notice it.  Anyway, came home, had a large gin and tonic and got started on a new jigsaw and that was lovely.",vaccinated,"So wait, what? In the US do you have to pay for covid tests? I thought I’d read that the US government made them free. Here in the UK tests are free but you have to have symptoms (cough, fever or loss of taste or smell) to request one. If someone tests positive, their household and contacts don’t get tested, they just all have to self isolate for 14 days. If they subsequently develop symptoms, then they can get tested. If you are told to self isolate by Track and Trace and don’t, you can get fined.",vaccine,"Question: Do you think people ever lie about having symptoms to get tested in the UK? I know some people in the US who are regularly getting tested even without symptoms and find it interesting how things are in the UK. I don't personally know people regularly getting tested but have heard of people doing it. Aren't you part of a trial? Answer: Oh yes I know some people have lied about it. However if you test positive, by law you have to self isolate for 14 days along with your household, and I think this puts some people off getting tested. I think more people lie the other way - not getting tested when they have symptoms, than lie to get a test. Yes I’m part of a trial so I actually do get tested every week. They’ve all been negative so far, but I have worried about what if one came back positive (while asyptomatic) and the effect that would have on people around me and places I’ve been (track and trace would be after them) and the things I wouldn’t be able to do. Not so much now as we are about to go into another lockdown, but over the summer we had some holidays booked and a random positive test would have meant we had to cancel.I can see the benefit for the greater good of the population for regular testing, but why would an individual without symptoms get regular tests… I don’t get that so much. I just find it stressful!",visitors,"Question: Anon, Sweden is not mass testing, Sweden is actually only testing people admitted to hospitals and healthcare workers! Answer: ^^",uk,"Question: What is a typical day like for you recently with the babies? Are you still volunteering at a vaccine site? Answer: Typical day: 7am wake up *BLURRRRRRRRRRRRRR* 11pm fall into bedI have neither volunteered nor worked in the vaccine clinics since the babies arrived, however next week I am doing a volunteer shift and next weekend I’m doing a paid data entry shift. It’s the school Easter holidays and d1 is home from university so there’s plenty of people around to do the childcare, and although I know I’ll be tired, it will also be great to be out of the house child-free for a few hours.",government,"Question: Obviously in the U.K. we are isolating at home but when looking at Sweden and South Korea, it’s potentially not the solution to self-isolate? I’m not saying it’s right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to “normal” - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn’t change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I’m not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don’t know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don’t know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren’t yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said “The only thing worse than no test is a bad test”. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren’t reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let’s see what today’s press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic.",going,faithhopeloveandtherapy:  Can I just say that doing a covid swab from the back of your throat that makes you gag. When you’ve a history of purging. Is not much fun.  @littlecondo thankyou we’re all fine. I’m in a vaccine trial so I have to swab every week FOR A YEAR!!,virus,Question: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being given where you live? Answer: Pfizer and AstraZeneca. It’s just chance which one you get depending on which batch is in when you get called.,stay,"Question: With self-isolation/social distancing etc, is there not a possibility that the virus could simply die out through being unable to be transmitted to another host? Therefore avoiding lots of people becoming sick/negating the need for herd immunity. That seems to be the approach of countries like Singapore Answer: Theres a tiny chance but I don’t think anyone realistically thinks the virus is going to just die out. It’s here to stay. It’s so contagious and someone somewhere in the world will always have it, so it will then be retransmitted. Naturally acquired herd immunity is a problem because we don’t know yet if people will be immune once they’ve had it or if they are, how long that immunity will last. A vaccine seems the most likely prospect for managing to live alongside this new virus."

So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don’t know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These 4 exercise I did for 1 minute each, and repeated the whole circuit 4 times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise 1 // Lat pull down // 1 minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise 2 // Seated chest fly // 1 minute
Keep your arms slightly bent and shoulder blades pinned back.
Exercise 3 // Flat chest press // 1 minute
Don’t lock your elbows at the top, have a slight arch in your back and press your feet firmly against the ground. 
Exercise // 4 Low row // 1 minute
Pull your elbows in and back, and hold then the squeeze for a second or so to feel the burn.

not having structure is something I struggled with and it would literally bring me so much anxiety that I would binge or not eat or shut people off or stay super busy or isolate to try to avoid it.

Yoga has been that place I could go to recharge. The place I can give myself a pep talk that everything is okay and we are safe and life is good. The place that I can find a little peace within me, to cultivate patience and understanding and compassion

#yoga #trikonasana #iloveyoga #yogaeverydamnday",strength,"i’m super happy about this set up in my room. it’s really interesting that i’ve been in this room so many times, lived and sleeped in it for so many years, yet i still discover ways to make it new. arrange furniture, change decorations, change the lighting situations. and just like that it becomes this whole new play ground for me to work, live, sleep, move, and just be.

that’s what yoga is like for me. and more specifically the #primaryseries. it’s the same poses and same movements yet each time something is different. maybe i discover a little more strength, more flexibility, a new way to move a muscle that makes the transition easier. i love this self-exploration thing that i can do with just a mat and an hour and some change

I decided for these I want to focus on certain parts of the primary series, so this first part is the #SuryaNamaskara or the sun salutations A + B

SWIPE!! upward facing dog ➡️Surya Namaskara A (real time)➡️Surya Namaskara B(real time)➡️the rest of the sequence that my camera managed to get before it ran out of space

The Surya Namaskaras in the beginning of the sequence serves as both a warm up and a call to concentration for the rest of the practice. It builds foundational energy and also draws one to focus on the breath to warm up not only the insides but the outside of the body

5 rounds of A is then intensified by 5 rounds of B, which adds in Virabhadrasana (Warrior 1) on each side, then the body is ready to continue on

10 rounds of Sun Salutations might seem like a lot and maybe excessive, but I love it because sometimes I come onto the mat with my brain all over the place and sometimes I even miss a step or mindlessly breath. 5 of each Surya Namaskara seems to get my mind right back into coordinating movement with breath and at the end of it, I am dialed in to a conversation with the present moment.",body,"uttana shishosana (extended puppy pose) with a twist

This is not how I wanted to share it - I wanted to drive to Nashville and get a quality recording. But it doesn’t look like that’s in the cards in the near future, so you’re getting it early. I was told many years ago (half-jokingly) that, in the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda, I would “write my way out” of my struggles. I couldn’t stop creating, even then. So I am writing my way out. This song is about battling my body, and is written for every one of my humans who has sat beside me in treatment centers and therapy groups and crying in hallways. I hope it resonates. (Yes, it’s recorded in a car and with a sad, probably out-of-tune ukulele because we make do with what we have.)",you,"Thank you to everyone who contributed to this month's #SelfLove Bops!⁣

Did we miss your go-to bop? Let us know."
14,14,running,"A little post 10K run photoshoot because . . . why not? And of course, Bali and Java had to get involved. I was on such a high yesterday after finishing my last kilometre because I felt so good the whole way (which doesn’t always happen let me just say that first). But I was smiling to myself under the sun, I felt super energised, and I was honestly loving the podcast I was listening to all about vegan athletes.

Feeling super inspired, I thought I’d answer the question WHY I RUN 🏃🏻‍♀️ I want to film a ‘running story’ video and also a Q&A all about running (both are on my growing list of videos to film 🙈), but I thought I’d share just a few reasons here first.
-
001 // It’s a reason to go outdoors and get fresh air. Personally, the UK spring weather is usually optimal for me: not too hot, not too cold, a bit of a breeze. But whether the heat feels claustrophobic or my butt cheeks are hideously numb, it’s fresh air and that’s what matters most to me.
-
002 // Recently, I’m running with the half marathon in mind. And that means I’m working to beat my previous time, run faster, or run a longer distance. Challenging myself with running has made it so much more exciting and rewarding.
-
003 // I think everyone’s probably heard of endorphins. With any form of exercise you get that positive feeling afterwards, but for me, endorphins are on an all time high after I run.
-
004 // Stress relief. At my desk, there’s a million-and-one things going on inside my head all at the same time. Whilst on a run, it’s a chance for me to escape that chaotic bubble and just be in my own company.
-
005 // Running is for anyone and everyone. For sure you have to train pretty intensely to be a pro runner like Mo Farah, but it’s so easy to just put on some trainers and run. And simply run for fun. I also love running to explore and find new places, which is something I loved doing in Australia (except in Darwin . . . yeah, about that 😭🏥).

Happy Monday my friends. I hope this possibly gave you a small dose of inspo to maybe go on a run this week 💪🏻",marathon,First run in absolutely ages and it felt sooooo good.,run,I ran 13.1 miles this morning btw. I’ve done a half marathon every month so far this year. This one was half on trails and I lost the trail around mile 8 and spent a mile running/jumping/walking straight through heather bushes till I picked up the path I was trying to be on. Bit stiff and achey now but overall I don’t feel too bad. Tomorrow I’m off to meet the babies in their emergency foster placement.,parkrun,"Day 6/21: Success! This has honestly been my best eating day yet I think. I still had ice cream, but I’m working on sticking to eating full meals and I turned down take-down because it wasn’t necessary to my planned meals for the day (also low-key concernés about how much my family is spending, so if I contribute less to the spending, I’ll feel better–just more motivation to make healthier choices!). My run wasn’t too great–the weather is really starting to get to me. But I’m still proud of the fact that I went running at all! I was so, so close to changing my mind when I started grabbing for my workout clothes, and when I started running, I almost convinced myself to stop early and walk instead. But I pushed through! A shorter run is better than no run at all. Tomorrow will be a full week binge-free, and I’ll be a third of the way to a rest birthday present to myself!",runs,alistinaisrunning:  Reblog if you plan on running a half or full marathon in 2020!,ran,"d1 and I volunteered at our parkrun this morning. We were on marshal duty and had a great time, leaping around and shouting encouragement as the runners came past. I decided even if it was ultimately annoying, at least it gave the runners something to think about while they were running! We got lots of compliments on our energetic cheering, and today’s run director said we should make sure we are marshals every time he is in charge because we did it so well. Woohoo! It nearly made up for not actually running.",pace,"One mile time trial  My 5k running training schedule had me run a one mile time trial for the last two Sundays. The first time wasn’t so bad because I’d never done a time trial before ever so I didn’t know what was coming. The second time, yesterday, oh my goodness it was hard. I went out too fast and then just wanted to give up and walk 🥵  There’s a really convenient road loop not too far from me that’s exactly a mile long but the corner I started from means that the first half of the mile is slightly (only slightly) downhill and the second half is slightly uphill, so even harder to run. If I have to do it again, I’m going to start from a different corner!! I was so relieved when I’d finished and my schedule revealed next Sunday’s run and it was a long run rather than another time trial.",miles,I ran 200km throughout February - that’s 50km a week 😳. No wonder my legs feel permanently tired!,race,Question: do you have any tips or a beginner hoping to start running? Answer: I’d say download the couch to 5k app. It’ll take you through an introduction to running that will gradually build up your fitness and running strength. It helps you take it steady as you build up your running ability which helps you stay motivated and makes you less likely to get injured. Good luck and have fun!,rest,"Yesterday I cycled up the long, steep hill that I originally had to walk and push my bike up. Progress 💪🏻"
15,15,cake,"Home from the wedding. What a lovely time of celebrating and partying we had!  • The whole day was in the most beautiful barn conversion - think wooden beams, sparkly fairy lights, greenery, Christmas tree…  • After the wedding ceremony while the photos were going on, a table magician went around the guests. It was the first time our girls had come across such a thing and they were absolutely blown away by him doing magic in front of their eyes. I had as much fun watching their reaction as I did watching the magician. • I love hanging out with my sister, she is such fun and brings out the party-loving side of me. And the rest of my extended family too. • The food was delicious. Three course meal for the wedding breakfast, and then in the evening we had Vietnamese chicken baguettes followed by wedding cake. The wedding cake had several layers, each one a different flavour: lemon drizzle, banoffee, apple and cinnamon and chocolate orange. I only got to taste the first two as by the time I got back to the cake table after dancing, the others had been snaffled up! I really enjoyed the food. I had two servings of the dessert above because it was so good! • Lots of dancing. The girls, me, my mum and my sister held up the dance floor for a lot of the evening. Even d3 seemed relaxed and laughed and danced with us. Lovely to all be having fun together. I have two blisters on my feet now though 😭 • We tried to do shots at one point, but the venue didn’t serve shots. So we drank amaretto with the tiniest splash of red bull served in tall glasses. Not-shot shots! • Got back to the hotel just after midnight and crashed. Then got up this morning and all had breakfast together, went for a swim and drove home this afternoon.",baking,The baby’s verdict is in. She loves tasteless beige food.,eating,"Question: Your struggle with chewing&spitting sound like you could do a 4 square pro/con list. PROS of c&s, CONs of c&s, PROS of NOT c&s, CONS of NOT c&s. This technique helps me get my thoughts out~ Answer: Yes I think I should do this. It might be enlightening. Plus I could use it to talk about in therapy. Thanks for the suggestion.I C&S the last piece of cake 2 this evening. Not because I was craving it but because I need to get rid of it and I can’t bear to just throw it in the bin. It’s a weird sort of ed driven anxiety thing. I’ve told d3 she can’t bake anymore cakes unless she is more proactive in eating them or distributing them to others.",eat,"d2 just brought me a cherry scone home from the cafe where she works, and I put butter and jam on it and ate it, like a normal person.  This is noteworthy because even a few months ago, if I had cake at home I would have chewed and spit it. I can’t say I’m going to eat every cake that comes my way from now on, but even to be able to eat this scone without being tripped up by the eating disorder is quite a milestone. It was a big scone, too 😋",food,"Question: Why didn't anyone want to eat the cake? Do your kids know about your Tumblr? Answer: It’s just that nobody is really bothered about eating cake in this house, but everyone likes baking. It’s a problem 🤷‍♀️d1 knew about my tumblr once because she got into it through my iPad one time a few years ago. However I’d say in general no they don’t really know.",eaten,"I am so done with cake for now. I was thinking how nice that all the cake is finally gone and I am going to have a total cake break and then try and reset. And then d3’s baking box came this morning in the post. A raspberry ripple cake. I feel like the universe is trying to tell me something. I am also very bored of talking about cake. But maybe the only way out of this cake struggle is through. If I keep eating cake till my body is bored with it as well as my mind, then maybe it won’t be anything special anymore and all this cake stress will ease off.",lunch,There is a birthday in this house (not mine) and everyone had cake.. and so did i. It was.. Okay.,slice,Question: Maybe you could look at it differently.. you don't *have* to chew and spit cake just because it's around. Maybe this is a good way to practice being around trigger foods and not using behaviors. Nothing bad will happen if the cake just sits there Answer: ….except it will go old and stale eventually and I feel anxious about what a waste it will be to have to throw it out.We gave two slices to our neighbours this afternoon so I think there’s less than a third of the cake left now. Hopefully H will have a slice later and d3 will have a slice and it will be nearly all gone then.,coffee,Question: Honestly if I were you I’d just throw away the cake  Answer: I can’t throw the cake away. d3 would be very upset.,myself,"Question: Cake is not lunch. By which I don't mean that you shouldn't have had the cake, merely that a non-disordered person would be likely to have something savoury for lunch (a sandwich etc) AND the cake. And I think you know this.  Answer: Sorry I’m a few days late answering this. You’re right I know cake is not lunch but I also have these weird remaining bits of ed logic. One bit is that if I’m on my own I can buy cake out more easily than lunch. I have a weird mental block about buying lunch."
