So it’s been over 3 years since I first got my glasses at uni. What a major throwback!!! Since my eyesight is not thatttt bad (my dude may say otherwise 😂), I don’t wear them very consistently, if at all in fact. But maybe it will be the next habit tracker for zee bullet journal 😉

I mean, I do notice that faces are blurry when people are a fair distance away from me, and it’s that awkward 5 minutes you spend trying to work out if you know them or not 😅 I missed spotting lizards on branches in Oz, but to be fair they are supposed to be camouflaged, right!? Iffff UCL accept my offer, I guess we’ll be back in the lecture hall too.

A lot of you guys asked me where these glasses were from. As I mentioned on my story the other day, they were very kindly sent from @misterspex_official and are part of their new CO CO range which has a big emphasis on sustainability. Even though the frames look like plastic, they are biodegradable which is just 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

They are a lot comfier than my original glasses ngl so there is hope that I’ll maintain this streak. You can also get discount until the end of the month using HOLLY20 🤓

thank you sooo much for all the love i’ve received in the past 24 hours!! 💍 i am truly grateful for every single one of you who choose to follow along here, write comments or send messages (it’s hard for me to respond to them all, but i seriously appreciate each and every one of them), and offer me your love, support, time, and energy.

i know it may seem a little odd to say, but here’s a reminder that we are allowed to feel JOY and experience HAPPINESS. even among grief and sadness, even if we aren’t where we want to be, even if nothing “special” is going on, there is space for joy, and it is a gift that is too precious not to treasure and hold onto.

this week is filled with a lot of different feelings and emotions, and everyone’s holiday week may vary drastically. please please pleaseeee remember that there is room for all feelings and to be kind to yourself and those around you.

pictured here is vegan chocolate and taro swirl soft serve that blake and i enjoyed from @masonscreamery yesterday! sometimes the simple joys are some of the best joys 🤍

.
i fell in love with words at a young age. i’ve always known that a perfect pairing provides comfort. carries weight. can heal.
.
when i was recovering from my eating disorder i was uncomfortable. nobody warned me about how scared i’d feel in my growing frame. how hard it’d be to see my body change and my clothes shrink. my skin felt tight as i expanded, forcing me to relearn what it meant to be whole. making this house a home was the greatest challenge.
.
i wanted to quit daily. weight was just sitting on my stomach and i was breaking out and having hot flashes and for some reason i was always hungry after a heavy meal? i didn’t understand. i felt like i was doing recovery all wrong. maybe i should quit.
.
in these moments of doubt i would call on positive self-talk. on words.
.
i was the girl whose bedroom was covered in posters of affirmations. who coated mirrors in post-it notes with uplifting reminders.
.
i spoke to myself kindly during my recovery. one phrase guided my heart: “all discomfort is temporary”. i repeated this to myself when my jeans felt snug or when my hunger cues felt off or when i swore the weight would never redistribute. i repeated this to myself when eating felt like death or when my sister would come home from a run all sweaty and sore, and i would watch with envy, having not exercised in months. .
.
recovery is hard until it’s not. you can’t give up because it’s uncomfortable. if it’s uncomfortable, it’s working. .
.
.
i handled myself with care because i was fragile. that’s okay. that’s fair. i put every last ounce of trust behind words of hope. i healed by way of forgiveness, toward myself, for my fears and anxiety and for hurting myself in the first place. .
.
.
i share affirmations on my stories because i know the power they have over our hearts, our minds. i hope they reach those who need them. i know i did. i still do.
.
fill your headspace with hope and trust and be willing to endure the pain. sometimes all we need is a fleeting reminder, one that comes at the exact time we need it. .
.
remember that all discomfort is temporary. push through, because temporary isn’t forever. you got this. ♥️

What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer. And think youre winning in life That is a VERY frightening place to be in and even harder place to crawl out of. A very sad, tiny little world to be in. Triggers in recovery are normal as fuck. I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of itI needed this tonight! I was reading over old writings from when I was deep in my ED and all the ways I could get back to there kept jumping into my brain. But I dont want to be there anymore. I may not be happy with where I am now physically, but I am so much happier with where I am as a person. Because I am a whole freaking person now!

Ok if you haven’t done the quiz yet on my story, it’s fun (she says), and also do it before looking at this spoiler. Most of the questions you guys answered correctly, however the controversial questions were “what’s my favourite food” and “do I do anything to my eyebrows” (which most of you answered wrongly 🤪). If I had to eat one food for the rest of my life, I’d definitely say oats, although that doesn’t mean to say I don’t love bananas and brown rice (and many other foods let’s be totally honest here!!!). And about my eyebrows, my dude @lemonem_ily plucks them for me and actually loves doing that kind of stuff, so it’s super useful for me. If I just left them to grow out, I don’t know why, but my eyebrow hairs would grow all the way down on my eyelids (lol 😂). They therefore need taming. Also, when I’ve attempted to shape my own eyebrows I left a big hole in the middle of one of them 🤦🏻‍♀️😑 ... never to be done again!

Change of topic, I’m off to trial a new gym this morning which should be fun. It also has a swimming pool so I’ll definitely be in that at the end.

It is a beautiful reminder of the importance of supporting each other and not being so hung up on the past or future that you forget the present. And for my friends in recovery, “The most important things in life are invisible” Not your body, not anyone else’s body, not the clothes tag number or the way you look in the mirror. Spend time making memories with people you love this holiday season.  The biggest regret I have in my life is spending years so obsessed with my body and diet that I missed out on being there while my sister and cousins were growing up. There is something devastatingly tragic about remembering all the hugs I refused because I didn’t want their little toddler hands touching my “gross” body. I would give so much to go back and give myself and the little ones all the love I couldn’t then. You are worth love and care and touch and affection, no matter how you look.

Doc ID: 8694, distribution: 0.3776634826428913 ; on paper, everything looks great…

you have the job, the house, the family, the friends, and yet…

you end the day wondering when you’ll actually feel like yourself 👀

is this you? ➡️➡️➡️

you have everything you need (+ honestly maybe a lil more) but can’t help but feel like you are missing something 

maybe… you’ve known this for a while but just haven’t done anything 🤷🏻‍♀️

here are 3 things that have immensely helped me feel less “stuck” and “confused”➡️➡️➡️

1. start doing just one thing that feels more like YOU. go on that bike ride, go read that book, go pull your tarot, put on a song from Renaissance and shake your 🍑 as vigorously  as possible… whatever that is- go make time for your joy!

2. soundboard. it can be your friends, your partner, a therapist, a coach, a mentor, someone who can be there to not give you advice but to reflect to you what you’re saying and how they receive you. there is magic in a space where you feel safe enough to share how you actually feel about your situation.

3. REST. you may just be feeling all this overwhelm because you’re burnt tf out. this is different from  # 1 because it’s not about doing things that bring you joy. it’s about letting yourself breathe (which is hard for those of us who have been conditioned to find “safety” in stress). we need time to reset in order to make a grounded, supportive conclusion. 

a little caveat- none of those will solve your problem 100%. 

they’re more like starting points that can help you loosen the pieces, so you can have better clarity on your picture 

life is too short to not live it the way you want, 

but it’s long enough for you to experiment, figure out where you want to go/what you need and transition slowly❤️

if you’ve been sitting on  the idea that the work you’re doing isnt doing it for YOU, you want to be EXCITED and PROUD of the work you do, i help women with that exactly.

Doc ID: 7855, distribution: 0.22995743179268857 ; one of the most frustrating elements of mental illnesses is that they’re so…invisible.
.
eating disorders live in the mind. physical manifestations are secondary to the root cause. .
.
it’s a head game. your mind is a control system that’s been hijacked, and the body responds to all commands. it knows they’re wrong, but it’s deeper than that. the hardwiring has been targeted and setting that straight is anything but a linear process.
.
so when i finally began recovering, nobody could tell.
.
my recovery was slow. i saw the changes i made as drastic. on the outside, the 12-foot hurdles i was throwing myself over were nothing more than bumps in the road.
.
its HARD to face demons when only you can see them. my family was my greatest support system. but they couldn’t understand the paranoia.
.
recovering from a mental illness is like being alone in a crowded room. nobody can push you to face your monsters. nobody can see them. they don’t make sense to anyone else. my disorder led me to fear things i knew were irrational but suffocated me anyway. .

sleeping through the night without sneaking a workout. using mugs without washing them 4x, in case a granule of sugar lingered from the last use. sitting in the high school cafe instead of a bathroom stall, even though i was convinced being NEAR a bagel would cause weight gain.
.
nobody said to me, “good job using a mug today” because nobody knew that specific fear was even an issue. i relapsed over and over. why? i waited for someone to see the problems i needed to fix in order to justify me fixing them. when i finally accepted that seeking external praise was crippling me (and that it wasn’t coming!), i was able to save my own life.
.
in a culture that’s conditioned to look outwardly to gauge success, facing invisible fears feels like a waste. i was discouraged to keep facing small fears because nobody was noticing.
.
i’ve learned that you have to carry yourself. because while your struggles feel invisible to everyone else, they’re not to you. you can see them...so face them. .
.
as my mom always says , “only you can help yourself”. so do it. they’ll notice one day. .
.
but that’s not really important anyway, right?

It’s no surprise to those of you who’ve followed me for a while that I don’t drink alcohol 🍷 Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried it (and have a very vivid memory of collapsing on a safa after drinking too much Pimm’s when I was a lot younger 😂). . . but being teetotal is a personal choice. 
-
Now before anyone comes at me: I’m not judging!!! It’s your life and we can all make our own decisions, but I do often get asked why, like why Holly, don’t you drink alcohol? It is, yes, partly because of the taste. I’m really not a fan. But I am just so incredibly scared of not being in control of my body 😳 Please tell me other people relate!
-
If you followed the Thailand vlogs you’ll be familiar with my alcohol taste-testing experience in Chiang Mai (and ofc @matt.j.white’s wild night out) 🍺😅 In that moment, I was like you know what let’s just try it. I was far from drunk, but tipsy Holly strutting to the club was kind of hilarious and that was enough for me!
-
On Koh Samui then, Matthew and I had the best time staying with @lubdkohsamui and I had a pina colada mocktail pretty much every day because I honestly loveee the taste . . . but just didn’t want the alcohol🍍 As I said, it’s a personal choice, I’ve never been one to follow a crowd and just because it’s not emphasised enough: you *do not* need to drink to have a good time!!!

🇹🇭 Staying with Lub D because they serve the best drinks, they now have vegan options on the menu (which I was honoured to taste test before it became official 🥺) and it’s right on the best beach! My discount code HOLLY will get you 10% off too 💚
-
🇹🇭 The Big Buddha and Smiling Buddha are two really cool and iconic temples to visit (with lots of cats too) 🐈‍⬛
-
🇹🇭 We didn’t manage to fit it in because of the rain, but you can visit an island home to pigs (Pig Island 🙃) on a tour un by @gojotours 👌🏻

🇹🇭 Running along the beach is such a vibe, and I also had a coconut oil massage along the beach too!! 10/10 recommend ✨

calories can just be calories.
movement can just be movement.

weight gain can just be weight gain.

we label things as “good” and “bad” and put so much power and value in things that have nothing to do with our worth. diet culture and society may try to make you think you are in control of having the “perfect” lifestyle, but there is NO perfect way to live your life.

next time you catch yourself shaming yourself or feeling guilty for what you ate, how you look, or how your body is, ask yourself, where did my beliefs about this come from? and learn to reframe your thoughts.

some examples:

“i can’t trust my body because whenever i eat X, i gain weight.” —> “i’ve broken trust with my body by trying to control it, and weight gain is not inherently bad. my body is on my side, and if it changes size by nourishing it with what it’s asking for, then it was supposed to change size.”

“i have to calorie count because i’m afraid of what eating more than X calories will do to me.” —> “calorie counting keeps me from using internal cues of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction. calories are not the enemy. they don’t do something to me, they are energy that do something for me.”

“other people eat and workout a certain way, so i’m supposed to eat and workout that way too.” —> “there is no ‘right’, ‘perfect’, or superior way to eat or move. that might be for them, but it is not for me.”

“moving my body every day is healthy.” —> “taking care of my body every day is healthy. sometimes that means movement, and sometimes that means rest.”

“being smaller than other people makes
 me better and helps me in life.” —> “accepting my natural body size whatever that may be and honoring what my body needs allows me to focus on living out my purpose which is what will help me live a more fulfilling and joyful life.”

Coming up to 3 years ago now and on a family holiday in Greece, I walked along the beach hiding my body under a dress and cried. I felt incredibly insecure, ashamed of what I looked like, and had not yet come to terms with how my body was changing and that it *needed* to change.
-
Since then, it’s been long, slow and steady journey of self-growth and self-acceptance. I’m not going to make out that it’s all been easy, because it really hasn’t. I’ve had a lot of highs and lows, better days and worse days. But about 2 years into this process it’s felt like I’ve just been climbing upwards.
-
A lot of you are familiar with my mental health journey, and I’d say that this was the final stage of recovery I needed to go through. In fact, the other day was the first time I’d put on a bikini in a long time, and it felt so liberating to not overthink anything and just ✨ live ✨ in my own skin.
-
We’ve all criticised our own body before and wanted something we don’t have, especially so in a bikini. But as I said, you already *have* a bikini body, and can you imagine just how boring it would be if we all looked exactly the same? Had the same curves, the same angles and the same lines? I couldn’t imagine a worse place to live to be honest . . .

——
you wanna know how to solve your constant hunger and voracious appetite? maybe the answer is to simply eat more. i spent years trying to control my caloric intake of every meal and “save room” for snacks in between and at night in order to “hit my daily goal”, and no matter what “high volume foods” i would eat, i’d ALWAYS be hungry.  i thought it was just who i was- that girl who eats a ton.  while i still LOVEEE food and can easily put down a lot of food, i’m not constantly hungry the way i used to be because i actually eat however much my body is actually asking for and don’t question it and just listen and provide what my body is asking for when it wants 3 dishes to myself at a restaurant or more food an hour after lunch.
——
post-the majority of my recovery and while i was simply trying to “be healthy”, there was a while i didn’t think i was dieting because i was theoretically eating “enough” and felt so frustrated as to why i was still always hungry.  in reality, i was still dieting because i was still ignoring my hunger cues.
——
whether you’re formally or informally dieting, if your body is trying to push you off your plan, it’s for a reason! so rather than trying to figure out ways to suppress or ignore your hunger, maybe you should respect and listen to your body, its cues, and how it FEELS instead because hunger isn’t meant to be “healed”, it’s meant to be fed! and food does that best!

if you’re scared of gaining weight, it’s not your fault- the majority of us have been had diet culture messages instilled in us from a young age, and we are constantly surrounded by them. but, the fact that 20+ thousand people have died in the US and many millions of americans have lost their source of income, and there are STILL diet culture messages specifically geared towards this time breaks my heart.

saying that this is the ‘perfect time’ to set a weight loss routine, joking about gaining the ‘quarantine 15’, and guilting people for not utilizing this time to ‘get fit’ is NOT okay and definitely not health-promoting. for the 30+ million people in the US who suffer from an eating disorder, messages like this can be extremely triggering. for the larger bodied folks, these messages are telling them that their bodies are undesirable.  for anyone who listens to and believes diet culture, these messages spread the idea that amidst a pandemic, the thing to really be afraid of is weight gain. how messed up is that?

truth is, there is no right way to look and no right way to be. you deserve to accept your body. you deserve to honor your body. you deserve to trust your body. you deserve to have your mental space not solely be taken up by thoughts about food and your body. you deserve to cope in whatever ways you need during this time (or any time) without judgment. you deserve to see your worth beyond your body. you deserve freedom.

i forget what he asked exactly, but somehow we ended up talking about my first inpatient hospital stay for my eating disorder.
.
see? totally not boring!

one thing led to another, an hour had passed, me detailing my experience. from being woken up at 5 AM each day to have my vitals measured, to my first real therapist, to the dread that would storm through my withered frame as a nutritionist ordered caloric increases what felt like every. single. day.
.
sometimes i get so caught up in things that just don’t matter. earlier this same day i tried on a new pair of jeans (pictured!) and they were a little snug. i didn’t dwell on it, but it was in the back of my mind all day. a few days before that i ate more sweets than i anticipated after recipe testing. again, didn’t dwell, just held onto at a distance.
.
after recounting the battles of recovery out loud, a wave of rationality crashed on the shores of my mind.
.
in the grand scheme of things, what are these faint thoughts? an extra brownie? a tighter pair of jeans? i have devoted so much time and energy to issues of greater density. endeavors that truly serve me. .
these little blips on my radar became pointless in comparison to my past. recalling my battles reminded me that the mere whispers of my eating disorder are not only irrelevant, but not worth my time. ive worked to put them behind me. to let them develop now? purposeless. .
all of this to say that as the holiday approaches, take a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come. where you want to be. where you can go. stay mindful of your strength when a triggering thought surfaces. is it worth your time? worth giving into? sit with it, recognize it’s there, and understand that there are things in life that matter more. save your energy for greater battles.
.
focus on what will serve you this season. nurturing relationships with family, taking part in tradition...seeing the smile on your grandmas face as you enjoy her homemade stuffing. that’s my personal favorite ♥️ .

wishing you all a beautiful holiday to come, and sending endless strength to you all!

Doc ID: 12571, distribution: 1.0 ; I got to listen to a doctor speak recently on the science behind eating disorders and one thing he said that stuck with me was that these diseases are 50-70% genetic. The rest of his talk went way over my head, but I’ve been thinking a lot about those numbers the last few days. We tend to look a lot at the external triggers that can lead to the development of an eating disorder (diet culture, the media etc.), which is really important to do. But triggers are just that: they trigger an already loaded gun. When someone explained to me once that my brain was wired differently, that certain events in my life and circumstances created the perfect storm that flipped the switch in my brain, I didn’t want to believe them. It was easier to think that this was somehow my choice and blame myself for getting into this mess - because then it meant I had control over getting myself out. Here’s the thing though: accepting that my brain is a little different didn’t sudden take away my ability to move towards recovery. It simply took away the guilt and shame of thinking this was my fault. I still have to learn to manage the symptoms of this disease through treatment and therapy and meds and support from friends. I still have to choose to move towards healing and life and freedom. But what I don’t have to do is carry the weight of shame and blame and heaviness over something I couldn’t control.

Doc ID: 2650, distribution: 1.0 ; HAPPY REAL ME MONDAY! 🥰 Ok, grab a cuppa tea & get comfy because I’m about to get deep… As most of you know, I’ve struggled with low self-esteem & a negative relationship with my body image for the first 23 years of my life. I always compared myself to these “perfect” Instagram models and celebrities online, I wanted to be slimmer, get rid of my cellulite, have a toned flat tummy 24/7 & I always felt guilty for eating. 

I ended up losing 20kgs in 2019, but even at the end of my weight loss journey, I still picked at my “flaws” and wasn’t happy. I still got bloated, had cellulite, rolls, a layer of fat around my tummy, my legs still wobbled when I walked, I STILL DIDN’T LOOK LIKE THE WOMEN I ASPIRED TO LOOK LIKE. 

The only time I looked somewhat similar to them was when I was tensing hard, sucking in, before I’d eaten and when I posed in unnatural ways. That’s when I realised that the photos I was seeing online were posed and “perfected” too. The women I aspired to look like only showed me 1% of themselves, the perfected 1% and it was unfair of me to compare the version of my body that I see every day, to the unrealistic version of someone else. And that’s when I started to really focus on rewiring my mindset around my body image. I spent all of 2020 practising self love and accepting my body without a need to lose weight, gain muscle, etc.. Just simply enjoy being in my skin without wanting to change it. And then 15 weeks ago, I started posting the REAL version of me publicly for you guys to see as well, because I’d much prefer to showcase my body’s normalities than portray perfection any day! 

It’s honestly been one of the best things I’ve done… 15 weeks ago I was so terrified to post the first Real Me Monday and today as I click “Share” I feel nothing but pride. I am who I am, and I like that person. All I hope for with these posts is that it may inspire you to do the same. I love you guys and I’m so grateful you’ve accepted me for me 💛

Doc ID: 9881, distribution: 0.4453085921125275 ; this week, i worked out once, ate maybe 3 home cooked meals and the rest of my meals out...and i’m pretty happy about it (my bank account isn’t, but that’s besides the point)
——
truthfully, i wanted to workout more days this week to clear my head in between studying, but chose going on a spontaneous ice cream trip or watching an episode of masterchef instead, and i wanted to eat out less after coming back from a few days of travel, but chose to go out for food with friends during this last week before winter break.  i don’t have any regrets because a huge part of what living a healthy, balanced, and free life to me is the ability to be fluid and flexible with my choices and also trust that my body’s on my side
——
it’s okay if you want to workout regularly and have preferences for food, but also know that it’s okay to not always workout when you want to and to eat things you might not exactly want. the interesting thing with food freedom is the more i practice it, the more i realize it was never about food in the first place. give yourself permission to surrender control when it comes to the things you eat because food freedom allows LIFE FREEDOM 🤘🏽, and you deserve to live a life that is full, vibrant, and free. happy saturday, friends! xx

lately though, trying to create content catered towards others has been incredibly draining for me, and i feel like it’s taken a lot of joy out of instagram for me.

something i really want to gift myself more is unconditional permission because i don’t need permission from anyone but myself to do the things that bring me peace and joy. maybe it sounds selfish, but at the end of the day, my life is about me, the person living it, and how i choose to spend my time and energy, and i need to prioritize my own unique life experience first in order to show up in the  world in the truest way i can.

this is me simply saying that i’m just gonna be posting whatever i want to - whether that’s my outfit, my food, my thoughts, my workout, my city, pictures i just like, nature, my daily activities, or whatever else - a heck of a lot more and deciding to have FUN with instagram again. i hope you like it, but if you don’t, that’s okay too- feel free to mute or unfollow whenever you want! i won’t take it personally, and i have lots of love and gratitude for you all ♥️

Doc ID: 2466, distribution: 1.0 ; I started sucking in my tummy when I was in year 5 (10 years old). 

I vividly remember moving to a new school & struggling to make friends. 

One day, I asked my teacher if I could stay in her classroom on my lunch break so that I didn’t have to sit on my own. My teacher told me “You need to try to fit in. Dress how they dress, act how they act, look how they look. You aren’t doing yourself any favours” as she ogled at me & tapped her gut, sucking it in. I still don’t know whether she was telling me to stop slouching or if she really was telling me that I should hide my gut, but it didn’t matter.

Small experiences like that when we’re young (and a lot of the times in adulthood too) have the ability to change the way we view ourselves. 

Those external opinions continued (from TV, magazines, school kids, etc) & had me viewing other parts of my body as bad too. I took those beliefs with me into high school, my workplaces, shopping malls, every holiday, nights out, everywhere.

The only space I felt safe enough to let my body relax was in the shower, which was also the place I was hardest on myself.

I technically hid my body & felt ashamed of those features until I was 23 when I realised it wasn’t shameful, in fact it was all super normal (cellulite, stretch marks, fat on your belly, tummy rolls, hip dips, etc)

Now I share all versions of myself online to reach others - like that younger version of myself - to show her she doesn’t have to “fix” herself to be liked (including by herself)!

If we let other people‘s opinions dictate the way we see ourselves & live our lives, is our life really ours in the end? 

If the way you look can sway the friends you have & attract into your life, do you really want them in your life anyway? 

When you think of the person you love most in this world, does your love & opinion of them have anything to do with THEIR appearance?

What do YOU think of you? Without all of the external opinions that have been thrown upon your shoulders.

You don’t have to be good enough for others. Be good enough for YOU to love you. Happy Real Me Monday 💫

problem solved 😌 no bake, high protein, and vegan too! these were an absolute dream. i hope you love them! 

mini pumpkin pie bites

- 1/2 cup creamy salted peanut butter
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 scoops (or 1/4 cup) vanilla plant based protein powder
- 1/3 cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
- 2 tbsp oat flour
- pinch each of sea salt, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon

mix all of the ingredients together until a uniform dough forms that holds together well. if the batter is too loose, add another tbsp of oat flour (this might be because the protein powder you used absorbed more liquid). once you have the right consistency, roll dough into balls and add to a plate. i rolled mine in chopped white chocolate but that’s optional :) place in the freezer for an hour or two to set before enjoying. store in the fridge for up to a week or in the freezer for a month!

Doc ID: 6771, distribution: 1.0 ; meet my current dessert obsession 🤍🤍

vegan, high in protein, no bake, and made with the most nourishing ingredients. truly doesn’t get better than this 🫶 the way to my heart is through my stomach… ESPECIALLY when the flavor profile is chocolate/peanut butter hahaha

hope you try out this super easy snack/dessert idea 😇 i’ve made these in the past and coated them in just melted chocolate, but i love the fun and unique twist of using chocolate yogurt instead! 

pb cup frozen yogurt banana bites

what you’ll need:

- 1 large banana, sliced into thirds and into halves again
- creamy salted peanut butter
- vanilla yogurt of choice (i used one single serve 5.3oz cup)
- melted chocolate (i used around 1/2 cup chocolate chips + 1 tbsp coconut oil melted in the microwave in two 30 second increments until smooth)
- chocolate chips for topping

directions:

start by smearing the banana slices with peanut butter. place each bite on a parchment paper lined plate and place in the freezer for 5-10 minutes or until the peanut butter is set. while those are setting, mix the yogurt with the melted chocolate until smooth and uniform. remove the banana bites from the freezer and dunk each one in the chocolate yogurt mixture until fully coated. place each one back on the sheet, top with chocolate chips, and place in the freezer to set. if you want more of a hardshell to form then these will need to set for 1-2 hours (or longer depending on the yogurt you used). i personally love these a little soft so i only set mine for 20 minutes and they were LOVELY.

Doc ID: 16464, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy 17.11.19 // connection and enmeshment  After we had talked through the whole “did you really mean to say it was emotional abuse?” issue and T had confirmed that yes, she did believe it was that, we got onto talking about the Christmas break. My adult self knows that the next two weeks over Christmas and New Year will go super fast and I will not miss therapy particularly. I’m securely attached enough to T that I can feel the connection with her even when I don’t see her, plus I have little strategies to boost that connected feeling such as I can look on WhatsApp and see when she was last online, and I can read her past messages to me, and I have the bowl she made me (which I dithered over bringing away with me but didn’t in the end - I didn’t want to have to explain it to anyone else who saw it and I was also worried it might get damaged in transit). T asked me how it felt going back to stay at my parents house after everything we’d just talked about. I thought about it. “I think…. uh I think I will feel a bit more separate from them. And a bit more adult”. T and I have talked recently about my mum and I being quite enmeshed. Not in the typical way I would think of enmeshed as being, but more in a way of me continually trying to align my thoughts and beliefs alongside hers. A sort of virtual enmeshment maybe. Now I’m facing the reality that there was emotional abuse going on and my mum did not stop it.  My parents are really coming off their pedestal as I realise more and more not only were they not perfect but they actually got some things very wrong. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14472, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: So I have a question.  Do you ever feel like there's two versions of you in therapy (adult vs child) and that they're responding two different ways?  I emailed my therapist that I had made the dean's list (3.5+ GPA (Or A-B average)) this semester and she told me that I did really good and that that was amazing.  The week before (we're every other week right now and I see her Tuesday) we talked about how I have such a hard time with praise (can't be praised/praise myself for what is 'expected' of me because parents always discounting my achievements, etc (long trauma history for me of emotional abuse from them, some still ongoing).  My adult self didn't respond to her email but tonight I'm feeling very emotional and vulnerable and I want to send her an email apologizing and saying she shouldn't have responded because I'm supposed to make dean's list and that I'm sorry for bothering her and that I'm sorry if I'm too much.  Adult me stopped me from sending it.  What do I do?  Do I send the email?  Why do I feel like this?  It feels so stupid. Answer: Hi anon, sorry I know I am very slow replying to this message. What did you do? Did you send the email?Yes I very often feel like there’s two versions of me in therapy, the adult and the child. Sometimes when T is saying something to me that makes my adult self squirm or want to discount, such as praise, I try and quiet that part of my mind and think “let the child in me hear this”. And I sit and listen and absorb what T is saying and believe that some part of me deep down is taking it in even if that other noisy bit of my brain is thinking bah! this isn’t for you! It’s kind of like stepping out of my own way and letting T in to do stuff in my brain. A person has to build up enough trust in their therapist to allow them to do that though.We feel like this because as children we got wrong or mixed messages that we made sense of the best way we could but that weren’t right. Now those beliefs aren’t serving us well and can get in our own way, so if we want to be free to live more authentic lives we need to undo those false beliefs and replace them with true ones. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15263, distribution: 0.1624899306859873 ; Therapy 04.08.20 // couples counselling  “I think I know what you’re going to say to this, but I wonder if you and H would ever consider couples counselling?” T made this suggestion in my last therapy session after I’d been talking about feeling on my own with difficult situations at home. She expected me to run a mile from the idea, but actually I would really be up for something like that. Not because our marriage is in trouble or at risk of breakdown, but just because it could help us communicate better and tune in to each other again. After all these years of therapy, I understand myself much better and I’ve changed a lot, and I don’t think H has really been with me on that journey. We still work very well together practically as a team, but we don’t have much time in our daily lives to connect emotionally. When we do have down time, we both are more comfortable just relaxing in our individual worlds. I said to T that I would need it to be not another thing that I am the driving force for, that I am pushing H into. Because then when I’m tired or feel like I can’t be bothered with it, I would need H to be encouraging me to do it rather than feeling like he’s got a night off from it.  I love love love the idea of being able to feel more connected and more open with H about what’s going on for me, but I do not love the thought of the work that would have to be put in. Especially as the prospect of therapy coming to an end is out there, I would like to transfer some of my attachment to T onto H, but I can’t. I just don’t trust him to be a safe person for my emotions, and the thought of doing the work to build that trust feels uncomfortable. Maybe it’s something for some point in the future, if life ever calms down enough.

Doc ID: 12874, distribution: 0.14100356020492993 ; some stuff happened i guess? yesterday was the first time since december that i actually worked with kids again!!!! nothing special, everyone was wearing masks of course and we kept our distance and stayed outside, but we made a nice campfire and talked a lot it feels bad because of covid, the number of new infections per week is rising again, what’s going on? it’s not like i have anything to say about it, though, and it definitely is very good for the kids - especially those who are facing trouble at home or in school, whether we may know about it or not, we do provide a safe space for them also, my girlfriend basically lives at my place now, yay to not being all by myself 24/7 and also yay to being forced to be responsible [with food] 
 
 
 now here’s a TW for sexual abuse/trauma reactions
 it’s scary how something that happened so long ago still affects me right now. most of the time i don’t even think about it, but it also seems to be all over me, does that make sense? my severe jumpiness is known to everyone, i’ve legitimately fallen to the ground and half under a table at work once - because one of my coworkers suddenly entered the room quite fast and it startled me. me falling or jumping away or flinching is a super regular occurence at this point. only a few trusted people are allowed to touch me, otherwise i get uncomfortable as hell, leading up to feeling paralyzed and in shock with a following panic attack in the worst case. sudden noises or people (especially men) shouting/following me/running towards me scare the shit out of me. i can’t stand anyone being behind me really and i can’t sit with my back towards doors/open space without going mad, i always look out for escape routes instinctively. it’s a part of me at this point, yes my poor girlfriend … despite being careful and understanding and all, sometimes a single move can send me straight into a flashback, meaning i curl up into a ball and completely lose touch with reality while sometimes shaking or crying, reliving it in my head or just disassociating. in this state i absolutely cannot be touched, else i just move away from whoever touches me in blind panic and it gets worse. last time a blanket was put around my shoulders, i apparently got off from the bed head first and curled up at the wall, looking like a bunny in panic. it’s not technically my fault and i am aware of that, but i feel so very bad about it still. i keep reassuring her that it is not her fault when i snap, and i’m working on communicating more clearly what i need/when i am not okay with something. she keeps telling me it’s okay and i don’t have to apologize, but i still feel so sorry. she’s not the one who hurt me, it’s not fair how she has to put up with it anyway now, kind of? because i know i’m not the only one who is struggling, i know it’s hard for people to understand and rationalize it has nothing to do with them personally when i snap and panic. somebody who once accidentally triggered this response in me said “i’ll never forget this look in your eyes, you were so scared … of me!”. it’s weird. yes i was scared, but not really scared of you. just. scared?

Doc ID: 17024, distribution: 0.13837738363573568 ; Therapy 21.08.19 // talking to H  “While we’ve been talking, I’ve thought of another question. I know it’s a bit controversial because I can see it in your face every time I bring the subject up, but where are you in talking to H about all this?” “Um… nowhere?” I’m being honest. H and I are not good at talking. We are good at tag teaming the childcare and dividing up the care of the house and managing our money and making space for each other to have their own time. 20 years ago we were good at talking, that endless talking where you can’t get enough of time together and you never seem to run out of things to talk about. Now, in the rare moments we are alone together and not zombified with exhaustion, we are more likely to sit in comfortable silence and do our own thing.  T asks what is stopping us talking, is it that I don’t want to talk or that H isn’t good at listening? I say it’s mostly me not wanting to talk, but H isn’t that great at listening either. He’s not. Recently I’ve got frustrated with him for scrolling through his iPad while I’m in the middle of telling him things. I don’t feel that I can trust him to listen carefully and value what I’m saying or to know how to respond, so instead I keep quiet and self contained. T says she thinks it is really important I talk with him about what’s happening for me right now, how my feelings about my mum are shifting, partly so that if the dynamic changes when we are with my family, he can be “on my side”. T can see in my face that I’m not very enthusiastic about the idea. What she’s saying makes total sense to me, I just feel uncomfortable about carrying it out. She pushes me a bit. “You don’t have to tell him everything all at once. You could just open the conversation, tell him a tiny bit of it. Or maybe even just tell him that you’ve got something you want to talk about, not now but another time.” Writing that now, I can see what she was doing, clever T. Breaking it down into the smallest possible step forward. It worked because thinking about it like that did help me feel more able to talk with H, knowing I could just say a couple of things and leave it at that for now. I agreed I would try and we left the conversation there. Although she did remind me again at the end of the session. She wasn’t letting me get away with excuses to forget.

Doc ID: 16374, distribution: 1.0 ; Ok so update on d3 and the autism question. In the weeks before Christmas, I was really wondering whether we should look into getting d3 assessed for ASD. She is struggling with *something* at school enough that school have agreed to look into doing a managed move to another school. The something is probably friendship group related but it’s hard to pin down exactly what. She takes up quite a lot of the pastoral/well-being staff’s time at school. It’s a large school and they don’t have the time they need to attend to everyone, but in d3’s mind, if they can’t make time for her or they aren’t there at a time when they’ve said they will be, they’re horrible people. It’s very black and white for her. She hates them and says they don’t care about her. She can’t seem to think that there might be a hundred reasons why they got called away or weren’t available at the moment. I’ve tried to talk that through with her but she refuses to consider the shades of grey. It was all making her quite unhappy and coming to a head and that’s why I started wondering whether we should look into an ASD diagnosis. (For any new followers, there’s more back story and it’s been something I’ve been wondering about for years now and other people have mentioned occasionally. So it’s not just based on these couple of events) But then I started wondering whether it would do more harm than good. Obviously I couldn’t take d3 for an assessment without explaining to her what it was for, and she would have to agree to do the assessment, or even just to get the referral for the assessment. And I am still not sure whether it would be more harmful than helpful to suggest to her she has ASD. She knows kids at school with ASD diagnoses, and their behaviour is more classic extreme autism - very different to hers - so I think it might upset her for me to suggest it. That’s why I asked about what age people think is optimal to be diagnosed in their own experience. I know that these days lots of adult women are being diagnosed, but I think it’s different as an adult and when you are maybe seeking a way to understand yourself. d3 does not want to be different at all.  So where things are now is that it’s all on hold again - until the next crisis, at least. We are waiting to hear back from the other school as to whether they are willing to create a space for d3 to move there. I watch d3 and sometimes I still think her behaviours are just normal teenage stuff. She is isolating less and joining in with the family a little more and with less complaints, which I’m happy about. I’m still trying to find the right balance between leaving her in peace but not letting her pull away too much, however things have been good between us since Christmas. Maybe it’s the positive effect of therapy as well. I haven’t spoken to her therapist about the ASD possibility. People who don’t know her that well look at me like I’m mad when I mention it. It’s only the people who’ve seen her a lot that start to join up some dots. Anyway, the therapist might be my next line of enquiry, if I do get concerned again.  So for now, just watching and waiting and seeing how things go.

You really do.”  We were right at the end of the session, after T had upset me a bit by cutting off our deep conversation rather abruptly. I think she wanted to say something positive to repair things. My brain was in overwhelm though so I couldn’t really respond to her. I just sat and looked at her. “I hope that doesn’t sound condescending when I say that…. I don’t mean it to. I am genuinely impressed with how hard you always work.” I wish I had shown some pleasure at what she had said, or even managed to smile at her, but I was done. I did manage to tell her that it was just that my brain had run out of energy to think of things to say. “Yes, I understand that. I do understand.” T knows me so well now. She has seen me go over the years from spending all session in a state of overwhelm when we first started therapy, to now when I just shutdown in little pockets here and there and I can go several sessions hardly doing it at all. And I do like it when she tells me she knows how hard I work, because it’s true. I do work hard, I push through my discomfort with being vulnerable. I’m happy that she sees that.

Doc ID: 14501, distribution: 0.22310397760827747 ; Therapy 16.02.21 // the intro  I was looking forward to this session. I had things I wanted to talk about that I’d been holding all week, and I had been anticipating the sense of comfort and relief that would come from sinking in to the session and sharing them with my therapist.  We logged into Skype as usual and the connection was poor, so T immediately suggested she send me a Zoom invite. I think she’s trying to change me over to Zoom, because this isn’t the first time she’s mentioned it. I’m sure it’s fine, I’m just ridiculously resistant to change and I’m like “Noooo you live in my Skype app don’t leave”. But anyway, Skype was misbehaving so we Zoomed instead and it was fine. I may even come to like it better because T has to send me the Zoom invite beforehand so it’s like a call to therapy and that’s quite nice. I said to T that I was super stressed because the builders next door were hammering away right behind the wall I was sitting in front of. I said I was worried it would be distracting for her or she wouldn’t be able to hear me, and she said not to worry about her, she could hear me fine and if it got difficult she would put her earphones in, which makes it easier to hear voices. So far so good. I had my notebook next to me with a few notes of what I wanted to talk about this session, and I thought from the fact that T and I had also had a brief text exchange this week - where I had sent T my mum’s Facebook post and a little comment, and she had replied “you are you and you are absolutely fine just as you are” - maybe she would be alert to the fact that I might need to talk about that.  Anyway, it seemed T had her own agenda.

Doc ID: 14956, distribution: 0.5137512448458742 ; We were a bit naughty yesterday and we went to visit d1 at her university. She was so desperate for us to go and see her and take her out for lunch. We drove there, picked her up, went to a lovely pub for Sunday dinner, then went for a walk in a local park, stopped in a coffee shop and then took her back to her accommodation and came home. It was a bit of a long day out but it was so good to see her and she kept saying how nice it was to do a normal and non-studenty thing, and just walk around a different area and see families doing normal family things. She seems to be much more settled at uni now, starting to find her feet and enjoy her independent living. I’m writing about it here because I can’t post it on any other social media, since we were breaking the rules. We left our tier and went to a different level tier which we’re not supposed to do. And then we went out for a meal (and later a coffee) and said we were all one household, which strictly speaking we currently are not, because d1 is in a household with her student flat. To order in the pub, I had to create an account on their app, which I had to invent a local postcode for. I couldn’t use d1’s postcode because it’s for a student flat so evidently not a family home. So much deceit. I feel very guilty. This aspect of the rules is very difficult for me, the way it divides students from their families. I just cannot get my head round my child who is only just over 18 no longer being in our household. Especially when come Christmas she will be back home with us again (so help me, UK government if you change that rule) so is it really that different.  Anyway this is my confession. I think our visit was very important to d1 and her mental well-being so I don’t regret it. Now England is about to go back in to full on lockdown, d1 may come home again in the next few days and we will be back to being one household again. Or she may decide to stay at university. I don’t know yet, I think she will be swayed by what her friends there decide to do. I think it will be possible to get her home in the middle of the lockdown period if she changes her mind so I don’t think it’s a now-or-never kind of decision.  Oh while I’m confessing, I also let d3 out of her 9 day self-isolation period 10 hours early because she was becoming one with her bed and that wasn’t doing her any good either. She had no symptoms so it seemed unlikely she was about to suddenly develop any. Anyway there we are I have off-loaded my conscience. The baby and I are off for one last Covid-secure swim now before the gym shuts again for lockdown. It will probably be our last ever swim together. Bittersweet times.

Doc ID: 15566, distribution: 0.432805623864723 ; Moving forwards in therapy  Therapy yesterday was really good. I’ve had a run of good sessions recently, no ruptures for ages. I wonder if it’s because I’ve built so much trust in T now that I can tell her in session, when it happens, if something isn’t right or isn’t helpful, and we can alter course immediately to get back on track.  I’m able to talk more fluently in session and although we still have pauses, they’re mostly not caused by my brain shutting down, they’re more constructive thinking pauses. It’s taken years of work to get to this point (I’m sure other therapy clients get there faster… I feel like I’ve been very slow, although I can also have compassion for myself and understand why that is, so I’m not blaming myself. It is what it is). I think we’re doing good work together at the moment. I feel like I’m moving through stuff. Some years ago, T likened our position in therapy at that time to being on a rollercoaster, but just sitting at the top of the track, moving back and forth…. not rolling backwards but not moving forwards either. At the time, she said it’s like we’re sitting up there, just waiting… waiting…. to set off forwards again.  I think I felt a bit unhappy with her analogy when she said it because it felt like she was saying we were stuck, and I didn’t feel like I was stuck. There was lots going on in my head, rearranging of thoughts, processing stuff, but it was probably stuff she didn’t see because I was still struggling to share everything I was thinking. Eventually I can’t remember exactly what happened, but there was a session where all my internal building of momentum finally reached a tipping point and we started to move forward again. I think soon after that, T said we were “hurtling along”.  I imagine that’s quite normal in therapy, periods of not much progress seeming to happen, and then periods of really fast growth. It’s not always an exact steady process. I feel like I’m in a time of fast growth again at the moment. Lots of little insights. Learning things in particular situations that I think I will be able to apply to broader situations in the future. Accepting my attachment to T and my feelings towards her as being ok and healthy and necessary to enable me to do the work I need to do. Learning to ask for and accept things from her.  It all feels good. We haven’t spoken again about her retiring, so I think that means the date is still over a year away. I’m glad about that.

I’ve always loved learning about the planet ever since GCSE geography at school. I remember reading textbooks about the IPCC, building case studies about renewable energies and writing about my carbon footprint in an essay . . . but then here’s the thing, I never really did anything about it 🤦🏻‍♀️ Fast forward a few years and I’ve now realised how much of a huge difference I could make - just as an individual.

Ok but first. If you didn’t know, the IPCC is a group of really cool scientists who work to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the climate, so that big global powers and policymakers can then set ambitious goals to tackle climate change. This year the UK are hosting COP26, which feels pretty special for us! This is the United Nation’s climate change conference where virtually all countries will meet in Glasgow to talk about ways in which we can better our planet’s health.

i’ve always been a sensitive person, so something that has taken me a while to learn is the importance of protecting your energy.  a big part of that means being picky and choosing to only surround myself with people who respect my space and also serve my greatest gold. BUT, you don’t always get to pick and choose every single person around you, and rather than just get angry at and take to heart everything that people from your coworkers to family who might have good intentions say, i think there is so much peace and value that can be found when you are able to listen to opposing points of views, think about why you disagree, *sometimes* share your thoughts, and walk away not feeling unworthy, but rather more confident in your beliefs.

Thats not how it works.Its okay to be struggling during these events. Idk how people aren’t, tbh.Gotta take extra care of your self. Any positive coping tools you’ve learn definitely apply here. Maybe even try some new ones. Also don’t be afraid to reach out to those who can help keep your head above water. Just because we have to avoid people doesn’t mean we are actually alone in this. I also think forgiveness is important. We are going through some serious shit and its gonna leave a mark. We don’t need to hold ourselves to the standards of a perfect statue unmoved and unaffected by what’s going on. Its okay to struggle and be upset and need help. Its okay to stumble and fall back. Because we get up again.You are not the same person as you were when you first started struggling way back when. When you relapse after your hard work, you don’t lose who you are now.

Prior to 2020, I spent years of my life not believing in myself.

maybe you’ve struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here’s what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don’t have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don’t show up 100% for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can’t do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else’s emotions (whew! that’s a big one!)

*drumroll because its such a mystery and you’ve never heard this one before in your life😜*

myself.

𝑰 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒅 𝒎𝒚𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒇 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌

because 𝑰 was scared to make the “wrong” choice

𝑰 was nervous about what people would think about me

𝑰 didn’t want to let my parents down

𝑰 didn’t want the time i spent in school/training/internship to go to waste

𝑰 wanted to make sure i was on the CORRECT path

but what 𝑰 really needed was to build trust in myself, my decisions, and my ability to catch myself when i fell.

𝑰 needed support, clarity, and guidance from my own inner compass.

once i realized i was the missing piece in all of these, it all clicked.

If you have the feeling that something needs to change, you know deep down that taking a leap will make even a short life worth living. 

So this is the time to get really honest about where you are, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 to be very compassionate with yourself, as this is not an easy spot to be in.

And if you need support, I got you!

i’ve had minimal motivation in the kitchen...and most other things in life lately, and you know what? that’s okay.

this season of life is hard. i sit in an uncomfortable high chair at my kitchen island 12 hours a day trying my best to do work. i hardly leave my apartment ever. i feel like i’m repeating the same days over and over. i don’t interact with many people. i simultaneously have a lot to do and nothing to do. i keep pushing things off. i’m exhausted.

there’s a lot for me to be grateful for, and i’m so proud of myself for everything i’ve been through, but sometimes life just feels hard, and that’s OKAY too. we are allowed to feel real human emotions because we are human beings just doing our freaking best to make it in this crazy world.

productivity may look different these days, but that doesn’t make any of us any less worthy or capable.

some affirmations for me (and maybe for you too):

i embrace myself and all the things that make me who i am.

i am on my own path. there is no being behind when the only person on this path is me.

i have enough, and i am enough.

i do not seek perfection. my mistakes are signs of growth and exploration.

i have time to become all that i am meant to be.

i am capable of doing hard things.

i am so rooted in who i am that no one and nothing can disturb my peace.

 Okay, you know what, I see your posts, and posts like this a lot about EDs in the actuallybpd tag that border on encouraging EDs, but this is just fucked up.  
 This is beyond your eating disorder, this is you being a cruel, fatphobic person. 
 You didn’t have to post this, let alone in the actuallybpd tag, a tag FULL of people who struggle with weight issues who might be triggered by this stuff. Don’t tag this with things like “mental disorder” to try and act like you can blame this on your mental health. This is all on you.  
 I see fucking thinspo and meanspo posts all the time in the actuallybpd tag, a lot from YOU specifically, and I’m sick of it. If you’re gonna be toxic, keep it in your own fucking spaces. 


 the actuallybpd tag is a joke in itself. what, because the people claiming “just bpd” arent authentic enough? you’re *actually bpd, not like those other ppl claiming bpd. how special. half of the people on this “achktualleh” tag are probably self diagnosed, and more than half of them are under 18 and theres still controversy as to whether or not bpd is even an appropriate diagnosis for a teenager. this whole op is a shit show. if you’re gonna be a repeat offender perpetuating fatphobic proana bullshit please just delete your account. i hope you think about this post the next time you’re stuffing your face, @afraidformyselfagain lmaooo. you’re so afWaiD for yourself that you’re tryna drag strangers down with you? foh

Doc ID: 9776, distribution: 0.4284400924656872 ; the “recovery community” and the “wellness community” have the potential to mesh so well together because they both really promote one thing: health.

health is multidimensional and depends on factors that are mental, emotional, physical, political, socioeconomic, spiritual, environmental, ethical, cultural, nutritional, and probably a few others that aren’t coming to mind. what that means is that what is healthy for one person may not be for another, and there is no “right” or “wrong” when it comes to what’s healthy or not because it is so individual.

just a reminder that if you are trying to take care of yourself to focus on YOU. this is your life. live it unapologetically.

p.s. no one is morally obligated to be healthy.

Temporary support group closures will go into effect today, Monday, March 16th.⁣ ⁣
During these times, we want to continue to offer as much support as possible. Therefore, The Alliance will be offering two free, weekly online check-ins with Johanna Kandel, Founder and CEO of The Alliance, with clinical oversight, to support group members across the country. ⁣
⁣
The Pro-Recovery check-in will be for individuals, ages 18+, experiencing and/or recovering from eating disorders, and the Friends and Family check-in other will be for loved ones (with Alliance board member Cherie Monarch). ⁣
⁣
The online check-in for individuals will be held on Monday evenings (starting tonight) from 7-8:30 PM EST and the Friends and Family check-in will be held on Wednesdays from 7-8:30 PM EST (starting March 18). ⁣
⁣
Registration for the check-ins is required. To register for the individual check-in and to register for the friends and family check in http://bit.ly/AEDA_Chat_With_Johanna_FF.⁣ (please not they are case sensitive).⁣

If you don’t have a place to go and are paying to stay there then that kind of defeats the purpose of a psychiatrist facility. You just would rather stay in that place where you get attention 24/7. There are real patients sectioned who actually need to be there. Not just some college kid who’s parents can afford to privately pay for a place that doesn’t care cause they’re getting more money than they would from insurance companies.  Answer: Hi! First, thank you for your input. I have been trying to “get out of the psych ward” for a long time now and have been told that I will be sectioned if I request to leave. However, I will gladly let my treatment team know that an anonymous person on tumblr has said that I am ready to go home. I’m sure they will value your opinion greatly.Secondly, I am here because I need to be here and I should not have to prove that or explain that to anyone. Also, how my treatment is funded is none of your business and your assumptions about me and my family are not welcome. My insurance company is paying for my treatment and I recognize that I am very lucky to be able to receive the treatment that I am receiving.Lastly, I am a “real patient,” whatever that means. Everyone who is here is here for their own reasons and no one should have to prove that they are “suffering enough” in order to receive treatment. Suffering is not a competition and every patient deserves to be treated with compassion. Have a nice day.

I’m used to this happening and I usually go along with it but I felt really crappy last night and didn’t want to be around bright lights or loud noises because it would make me more anxious. I was also super out of it and not myself at all. I couldn’t really process what was going on and I was so dissociated that’s everything felt like a dream. I refused to get out of bed and that somehow escalated into them threatening to call security on me. The staff here aren’t allowed to put hands on patients so they couldn’t make me get out of bed but security could have. It would have been three large men in scary uniforms and that would have been very triggering for me. I eventually got out of bed to avoid security but it just made me more anxious.

Doc ID: 19575, distribution: 0.25255453820909607 ; Question: I’m always curious about people’s inpatient stays because I’ve never gone but feel like sometimes I might need to but I never know how to get there or what to say :/ Have all of your stays been from a section? Or did you bring yourself there? How long has each one been? How do you know when you need to leave? Have you ever wanted to leave but they said no or wanted to stay and they made you leave? Sorry for all the questions :( Answer: Hi! You don’t have to apologize for asking questions. I don’t mind answering them and I have nothing else to do. I didn’t really have a choice with any of my hospitalizations but technically only one of my stays was because of a section. Basically my therapist asked me if I would agree to go or if she would have to “pink slip” me, which is what they call it in Ohio. I agreed to go and they took me to the ER and the ER sectioned me even though I said I would go inpatient. The other three hospitalizations have been voluntary on paper but in those situations it was more of a “you can agree to go or we will make you go” so it wasn’t really that voluntary. It just shows up differently on your records. My first hospitalization (the pink slip one) was only 72 hours. That hospital was terrible so I lied my way out of there (I do not recommend doing this because I just ended up getting hospitalized a month later). The second hospitalization was about a month and a half. The third one was about two weeks. The current hospitalization is two months and counting. I don’t really know how I know when I need to leave. I don’t particularly want to be here but my treatment team determines when I am ready to leave. I really don’t have any say in any of that. I could sign a three-day, which would mean that they have three business days to evaluate whether or not I need to stay and they will either discharge you or section you. I was told that I would just get sectioned if I try to sign one so I’m not going to bother. I have wanted to leave many times and they won’t let me. I’ve never wanted to stay and been kicked out because they would be liable if anything happened to me after discharge.

Doc ID: 22204, distribution: 1.0 ; Day 12 of inpatient was the best one yet! I got moved up to level three, which means my dogs can visit me and I can get passes to leave the unit. The highlight of my day was seeing all three of my dogs and getting to walk them around the hospital grounds. I ate a lot of food today and I’m proud of myself for that. I struggled a little after but I forced myself to stay in open areas and used some of the coping mechanisms I’ve learned here. Overall, it was a really great day and I’m so grateful for the staff and my safety.

It’s also a (quite a bit) late (lmao why I always late) but this year on the 24th of June marked my 4 year vegan anniversary!!! For the record, this is the only anniversary I celebrate and I will be celebrating for the rest of my life let’s be real. That day means so much to me and here’s just a little insight into what I used to think of so-called ‘plant eaters’ before I went vegan.
-
Disclaimer ? ¿ No this is not me being preachy. I’m just dispelling some myths because I used to think this way 4 years ago. I also don’t want to ever be afraid of labelling myself as a vegan. For sure it sometimes gets a bad rep, but to me, as I said it means a lot. And it’s one big part of my life #VEGANhollyg (I thought you needed a hint) 💚🐧
-
001 Being vegan is expensive ? -> From my experience in the UK and travelling so far (very limited I know but still counts) this is not true. For sure it can be pretty pricey if you buy a lot of branded vegan foods or fake meats for example, but definitely not if you eat a whole foods plant-based diet.
-
002 Veganism is restrictive ? -> Welllllll never had I ever tried avocados, mushrooms, lentils or brazil nuts before going vegan sooooooo for me, veganism has clearly opened my eyes to so much more that I can eat.
-
003 I’d be protein deficient ? -> All I need to say is “people eat meat and think they will become as strong as an ox, forgetting that the ox eats grass”.
-
004 Veganism will make me fart more. ? TMI or whatever. Hun. HUNEYYYY Holly farts a tonne anyway so I dispelled that myth ok.
-
I could talk so much about this stuff and dispel a whole lot more. But put it simply, veganism is a one-way street for me. No U-turns.
-
Tag me if you make any delishhh vegan meals and let me know if you challenge yourself to go vegan for one meal, one day or anything at all. I want to hear your stories and help you along 🦋

My first ever half marathon that I’d been training for since the start of the year 😭 And my mum’s big birthday ceilidh party that should have been next weekend. Plus we had theatre tickets for this month and the show has been cancelled. And d1 had a ticket for a festival in June and that’s been cancelled.  What movies have you been watching recently? We watched “Joseph” on YouTube the other night, does that count? What are you doing for self care? Running, reading, jigsaws, playing a computer game, doing a free level 1 British Sign Language course, playing cards and board games with the family What shows are you watching? Currently on TV - Race Across the World (a big favourite), Liar, Our Girl…. and on Amazon Prime I’m still working my way through Grey’s Anatomy. Not getting to watch much at the moment though. What music have you been listening to? I have a running playlist made up of worship songs. A current favourite is “Sovereign over Us” by Aaron Keyes.

Living room floor has a big heap of rucksacks, water bladders, head torches and many pairs of walking socks. I’m excited but that feeling is rather pushed out by everything else that’s going on.

I wanted to text T and for her to tell me it was ok, that would have been the easy way out. If I’d had one of the girls with me, I’d have had got fish and chips for them no problems. So I tried to imagine a combination of what T would say if I did text her and then also imagine that I have my own inner child with me and what would she like. That helped me have compassion for myself and my needs.  Fish and chips now eaten. The baby loves the sand! She has eaten quite a lot of it and improved her crawling and climbing techniques.

Answer: They would have to put them between multiple families and then organise for them to have contact together on a regular basis. I know someone in my town who fostered baby triplets.

I'm currently fostering a cat and I am going to have such a hard time letting her go. Answer: We let them go because we have to. There’s no way we could do it if we had a choice about it. Saying goodbye is absolutely the hardest part of fostering. It is one of the most emotionally painful things I have ever done, and I’ve done it 9 times now. Sometimes I cope reasonably well with the grief, and sometimes it absolutely flattens me for weeks and weeks. There’s been times I’ve felt I can’t put myself through this pain ever again, but so far I’ve always gone back. We always have a break after a baby has moved on, and we don’t go back on the list for a new placement until we’ve got ourselves emotionally back on track. (I know this was an old ask and I hope you managed ok to say goodbye to your foster cat if that time has passed)

Let’s encourage one another and lift each other up rather than bringing everything down. Look for the good rather than dredging up the bad. There’s enough bad going on with coronavirus, adding to it benefits no one.  Maybe you don’t like the Tory party (neither do I), maybe you are angry at the chronic NHS underfunding (so am I), maybe you wish everyone could get Covid testing (so do I). But suck it up.

Bc here it's quite a big topic  Answer: Hmm there’s surge testing going on right now which means when a case of the variant is found, testing goes door to door in that area to find anyone else that may be carrying it. That’s currently for the UK variant and also for the South Africa variant. I hear more concern about the SA variant in the news than the UK one. I’m a bit confused about the UK variant because over Christmas it seemed to be all over the UK and it’s main feature was it was so much more transmissible. I think its had another mutation now that potentially makes the vaccine less effective. What is being said about the UK variant in Europe?

Doc ID: 15691, distribution: 0.7400091232963744 ; Question: Just a thought. As a Swedish-American living in the US but with plenty of family in Sweden, my thought is that Swedish people are just really healthy. I don’t have any numbers to back that up, but their welfare system is well-developed, people generally live in good and spacious conditions, etc. I believe I read the people who have died in Sweden are elderly and/or refugees(who don’t have access to all their resources...). You’re right, it is interesting. Answer: I agree Sweden is a healthy place to live, I also have UK friends living there. However if you look at the deaths per million, Sweden have the 8th highest in the world so they’re maybe not doing that great. But even the deaths number is so variable between countries, including or excluding as it does different settings. And being variably representative of the truth in different countries. I think looking back eventually at the excess deaths will give a more accurate picture but we’ll probably never know the true numbers.

Doc ID: 15853, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: With self-isolation/social distancing etc, is there not a possibility that the virus could simply die out through being unable to be transmitted to another host? Therefore avoiding lots of people becoming sick/negating the need for herd immunity. That seems to be the approach of countries like Singapore Answer: Theres a tiny chance but I don’t think anyone realistically thinks the virus is going to just die out. It’s here to stay. It’s so contagious and someone somewhere in the world will always have it, so it will then be retransmitted. Naturally acquired herd immunity is a problem because we don’t know yet if people will be immune once they’ve had it or if they are, how long that immunity will last. A vaccine seems the most likely prospect for managing to live alongside this new virus.

On the outside the primary series might seem boring and repetitive with nothing else to offer. BUT I keep learning more and more every time I step on the mat and practice. I keep feeling new areas of my body and in my emotions that I would not have uncovered before. One thing I know is that yoga is a life long school. I don’t think I will ever stop being a student and learning from it. there’s so much more that I can learn from this particular primary series and that’s why even though I’ve learned the secondary series I don’t feel like I am ready for those lessons yet… If that makes any sense I’ve been getting a lot of questions about whether or not I still practice secondary series and I don’t because I still want to squeeze out more from a regular primary series practice before I move onto the next thing

I would always get achey and sore and also get cramping in my legs and lower back when i was in my ed. Even now that i eat plenty and am at a higher weight i still get cramps now and then. Im probably lacking in specific nutrients or minerals or whatever my body needs. Idk! I also crack my joints and sometimes if i cant get it to pop i get extra aches. I also very little muscle definition and am weak so i get sore easily. Maybe you can relate to any of that?Do you have swelling?Does propping your legs up on a pillow help at all? Theres probably a lot of things it could be. Bad joints? Weak muscles? Maybe physical therapy to build up the strength? Idek. I dont have any answers here. Sorry dude.. If you are able to email a doctor maybe that could help youI have heard many times that when we are deep into ed for a long time and then finally come out of it into recovery, all the medical issues start to show up. :/ Sorry for the long response. I miss human interaction. Maybe someone else reading this can say something a lot smarter than i

Doc ID: 9130, distribution: 1.0 ; This morning's flow (had to start it with a little booty shake lol). My body felt all kinds of tight today so I got into all my favorite long holds, heart and hip flexor openers. Its interesting how the body will move the way it needs when it's allowed to freely flow. I'm super grateful for a healthy body that can stretch and breathe and root down with strength.

Today's a reset for me as I've spent the last couple days in San Diego hanging out (you'll know if you're in my story gang 🤘🏼). Edited and uploaded a video on the tube, started laundry, cleaned my room, drank water, and groceries so I can meal prep for the next couple days. I'm back on the work grind tomorrow AAAAND teaching Ashtanga at @yogabody_studios on Saturday morning😬😬 honestly I'm excited but nervous at the same time to be leading classes.

When I think of all the things I have going on I realize it's a lot and can make someone go crazy so I'm grateful to have found a grounding practice that helps me return to myself when the times get tough (aka everyday because I'm a sensitive gorl). Sending you all love today! xx .

Doc ID: 9155, distribution: 1.0 ; What an open heart can do

currently on the way back to Rishikesh, where I will complete my 500 hrs yoga teacher training. i’m surprisingly MORE excited than last time. I fell in love. the sound, the colors, the energy, the stillness within chaos of Rishikesh. it captured my heart— how freaking rad is it that I am healthy enough to come back? that my boss allowed me to take this month off after just starting work? @rishikeshvinyasayogaschool coincidentally launched their 300 hour training right before my 200 was over and after i had asked about the possibility of them having an advanced training. I immediately signed up cause if that’s not a sign what is ¯\_(ツ)_

i’ve been trying to do this thing where I just have faith and let faith lead me. have an open heart to different possibilities even if it means an open heart to heart break. even through pain we continue to grow.

ahhh i’m so excited i’m about to get yoga wasted!!!! (and by that I mean... gracefully enraptured by the yoga capital of the world once again) also the international Yoga Festival in Rishikesh takes place my first week there. someone’s GOTTA be listening to me. or just gently guiding me where i’m supposed to be 😌❤️❤️🌟 📸 @_wideopenaperture

Doc ID: 9014, distribution: 0.5133568642098962 ; there’s a conversation i’ll never forget i had last year with one of my classmates in my teacher training course last year. he studied hatha yoga extensively and was getting his masters in yoga therapy in an indian university. he emphasized how meditation is so important these days. how can we really know what we truly want, how we honestly feel, when there is so much around us telling us what we SHOULD want, what we SHOULD do? he said, you have to go somewhere quiet. somewhere peaceful, without your phone, without interruptions. you have to sit and breathe. only until you are in a place that your mind is still and silent can your soul truly talk to you. that is when the answers come. that is where YOU are
_______
i noticed a similarity with social media. the more time i spent scrolling through my feed filled with certain images and videos, i found a subconscious pull to shape my own actions and goals to that. whether it was fitness, beauty, fashion, meals, hobbies, etc. the more i surrounded my mind with outside influences, the more i wanted to do the same
_______
don’t get me wrong, i defffffffff am not immune to trends. i fucking love these infographics all over IG right now for example. i’ve actually always loved doing this kinda graphic stuff but never knew i could apply it to my page in a useful way until i saw other people do it. i think they’re interesting and very useful for future reference
_______
i just am more conscious about who i follow and why. i try to not spend too much time “watching” and “absorbing” the works of others as it hampers my own creative process/development
_______

for example, this is my body now- without trying to change or shape anything. once i stopped surrounding myself with all the “body” goals i used to scroll through, i found this new appreciation and acceptance where i am right now
_______
i love appreciating the works of others and sharing their creations with the world. i love raising other people up. i just don’t feel the need to label anyone or anything as “goals” because trends and influences come and go. what stays is that quiet voice that reminds us over and over who we truly are.

Doc ID: 9081, distribution: 0.11581644546937463 ; This was a really hard week. actually it was a hard month

I posted about studying on my story, It was on my mind ALL month. “catch up, catch up, catch up” I said to myself. “you can do it, you can do it, you can do it". but time slips away while juggling lots of things and this week I felt like I had nothing to show for the effor I was trying to put in. I know the Aquarians can relate lol

I wanted to give myself a chance to try all the things. and I did. in a post earlier, I said “I know that at any time I can withdraw from any activity if I feel it is doing me worse than what I intended. I know that I can always come back to my breath during my highest times of anxiety and stress.” and I really stuck to that! manifestation! daily practice! thank God for yoga

under all this pressure I chose myself over my ambition. self love isn’t pushing yourself to do your best all the time. it’s nurturing that child within and making that gentle, warm space where you can bloom. it’s reaching out for help to show yourself you’re not, in fact, alone. it’s standing down when you realize you are out matched in the battlefield you created

i’m super grateful for all the lattes and support i’ve gotten, prepped meals and snacks like the delicious/easy to transport/recyclable/plant based meals from @splendidspoon.ny (I forgot how much I love quinoa!!!!), and for all of these events In my life that make me want to grow

thank you for your warm energy and bringing my thoughts to life in your world

You guyssss, meet my new E-BIKE ahhhh!!! 🤩🙈 I was so so excited to collect this when I returned home from Spain, and since being back in the UK I have been re-finding my staple Holly routines again 👌🏻 Think smoothiessss, work sessions with Milka and making the most of the warm-is weather before autumn fully hits us ⛅️
-
At the moment my days are centred around marathon training, as you guys know, and so recovery is super important. I’m finding that taking out my new bike is therefore the best way to get out of my head, de-stress and simply move my body without tiring my legs out too much!! 😅
-
I also don’t own a car at the moment and I don’t plan on buying one any time soon, so I love how it gives me the freedom to get myself to places more easily (a full charge in four hours does 170km, which is such a big range!!), avoid traffic (big win 😉) and not cost the earth 🌿
-
I’ll have to find a name for my bike I think, but definitely go show some love over @momentumbikinguk and check-out what they do 👌🏻 They make such cool E-bikes, and you’re more than welcome to join me on fun countryside adventure if you decide to get one 😉

Thankfully it’s a rest day with no running planned, but I think I will have to miss tomorrow’s run if it still hurts like this. I always can run through the pain but I’m trying to employ my sensible mind and know that it wouldn’t be the best idea.  The moral is that you can still run in your 40s but you will hurt pretty much constantly.

This run felt SO GOOD 💪🏻 I did 26km in 2 hours 18 minutes and even though I’ve run this distance a bit faster previously, in 2 hours 15, I was so happy because I managed to keep my heart rate a lot lower than usual (167bpm compared to 180bpm) 👌🏻
-
I also used my new @high5sportsnutrition energy gels, which are working really well for me and they taste really nice too 😉🍎 Mum even tried one yesterday, because she was curious, and enjoyed it . . . so you’ve got the @veganmutti approval right there 😅
-
Running this distance now makes the marathon (42km) sounds more manageable in my head. It is going to be tough for sure, but I am SO EXCITED for my first ever race!!! And it being the. London. Marathon is just a dream 😍

Doc ID: 16042, distribution: 1.0 ; Running Madness  I’ve been really trying to eat more carbs and I think it’s paying off. My runs this week have felt so much better than last weeks. My legs have felt good and my times have been faster. Today I was scheduled to do a 2 hour long run. I set off and it was going really well. One of those runs where I just felt like I could keep going and going. I was about 75 minutes in, going steady back in the direction of my car when I got a phone call from H to say my tutee had arrived 🤯 Eek, I had forgotten all about her coming today. She only comes once a month, but I had been thinking about her earlier so I don’t know how it all went clean out of my brain. I blame the sleep deprivation. H had to come out in his car to scoop me up from my run. I was really gutted to have to cut it short because it was feeling so good. I put a sprint on to get as far as I could in the last 15 minutes or so, and surprised myself by how much of a spurt I could do after 9 miles. When I’m actually running the half marathon, I will have to think of tutoring at this same distance point and visualise the same situation and whoomf! off I will go. In the end, I made it to 10.5 miles before H caught me up in the car. He whizzed me home (I was very grateful!), and I spent an hour tutoring Circle Theorem, before shoving my (cold damp) running clothes back on and running 2 miles down the road to rescue the car from where I’d parked it at the start of the run. Finally made it home just in time to eat tea cooked by d2. Madness, I tell you.

This was just a short 5K easy run, but it felt pretty tough 😅 I mean, I haven’t run in over 2 months so it’s going to take a bit of time getting back in to the swing of things! I’m also not a huge fan of 5K as a distance haha (anyone relate?)🙈

However. The most important thing is that I didn’t feel any pain in my achilles and it wasn’t stiff afterwards, which is THE BEST THING EVER 🎉

Doc ID: 13361, distribution: 1.0 ; Day 6/21: Success! This has honestly been my best eating day yet I think. I still had ice cream, but I’m working on sticking to eating full meals and I turned down take-down because it wasn’t necessary to my planned meals for the day (also low-key concernés about how much my family is spending, so if I contribute less to the spending, I’ll feel better–just more motivation to make healthier choices!). My run wasn’t too great–the weather is really starting to get to me. But I’m still proud of the fact that I went running at all! I was so, so close to changing my mind when I started grabbing for my workout clothes, and when I started running, I almost convinced myself to stop early and walk instead. But I pushed through! A shorter run is better than no run at all. Tomorrow will be a full week binge-free, and I’ll be a third of the way to a rest birthday present to myself! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15475, distribution: 1.0 ; I did it!  This morning I did my end-of-training-plan 5k run. I imagined I was going to do a parkrun, although I didn’t run a parkrun route because the parks are so busy at the moment. So I got up and did all the pre-parkrun things I usually do and that helped me get in the mindset of going out to run 5k. It also made it feel less daunting because I don’t really get stressed out before parkruns.  I didn’t quite manage it in 22 minutes, but I was just over 22 and a half minutes. Strava tells me that is a 5k PB so I’ll take that 🙌 I think the parkrun where I ran slightly faster probably was measured a bit short as it didn’t register as a 5k on my garmin. Anyway I felt like dying while I was running and had to use some mental toughness to keep going but now it’s over I am feeling awesome. Tired out but awesome. I’m glad I pushed myself to do it. I’m going to try and have a week or so off running I think to give my joints some recovery time. I’ve done two 11 week training plans just about back to back since the start of 2020 and run 600 miles. I’ve read about training plans where you adjust your pace to keep your heart rate in certain zones, so I might try one of those next. They apparently improve your baseline fitness and don’t involve a lot of fast running. But for now, the sofa calls, along with my book I’m trying to get read for book group tomorrow evening. I’m off for some restful reading.

-
So I’ve been out of running for about 4 weeks now, and I’m only just starting to get back into it slowly. Don’t get me wrong, it sucks not being able to do the things you love, buttttt. In the past I used to get so frustrated with an injury just because I feel the *need* to exercise.
-
I used to do literally anything and everything to keep moving: push through pain, delay the healing by just continuing to run, orrrr cycle a tonne for example, even though I’m not the biggest fan of just staring at a blank wall whilst spinning my legs 😅
-
For context, I basically came off with an injury after my 30k run in December last year. And tendonitis is definitely not something that heals overnight annoyingly. But this has been the first time (in my life!!) when I’ve truly surrendered and just given my body the time it needs to rest. And most importantly, I haven’t felt at all bad about it at 👏🏻 all 👏🏻
-
Ok I may have lost a bit of fitness and running progress, but at the end of the day, everything is only ever temporary and your health and your body has to be your main priority 🤌🏻
-
So please please please look after yourself and remember that rest is essential! If you also find yourself in an unhealthy relationship with food, your body and exercise, then I definitely encourage you to reach out and get help, because you really don’t want to live the rest of your life trapped in that bubble! Trust me, I’ve been there but I’m never going back 💚

Doc ID: 16391, distribution: 1.0 ; Good morning and welcome to Friday. I’ve been a bit quiet because I’m trying to get the coursework for my baby sleep course done and it’s a bit of a slog. I can answer the questions no problem but it’s the referencing 🙄 everything I write I have to find some scientific paper to back it up and that just takes forever. Anyway I’m making slow progress with it. Today I have a fairly clear day so I’m hoping I can crack on with it. The deadline is about 10 days away so I know I will have it done by then. I can’t think about much else until it’s done though. Still running as per my half marathon training plan. Yesterday I did some things called Stride Repeats. I have no idea if I did them right. I read some stuff and watched a video on YouTube and I’m still a bit hazy about the differences between stride repeats and speed repeats and intervals and things like when the training instructions say “challenging run; fast pace x minutes/mile ; no sprinting”…. I’m not sure how to run challenging and fast without sprinting. At that pace I am sprinting 😭😂. I will just keep taking one day at a time with it and trust that it will get me where I want to be by the end. Today is a rest day and I will be resting. No running.  Btw I see your questions in my inbox and I will try and get to them when I can.

Doc ID: 16236, distribution: 1.0 ; Ahhh I’ve had such a lovely lie in this morning. First time in 12 days there was no need to set an alarm.  We had a great night at our friends last night. They live just down the road from us and we became friends when our second children were born 15 years ago. She is my best friend and we try and have coffee or lunch together one a week and process some of our emotional turmoil together. We’ve had lots of meals together and we have similar tastes in what we like to eat. Top of our favourites list for a starter is anything involving scallops and king prawns. Top of our favourites list for dessert is anything lemon-y. I made a baked lemon cheesecake. With extra lemon for added zing, and raspberries on the top. Main course has more options because it’s a chance to explore new recipes. Last night they cooked duck with pomegranate seeds and bulgar wheat. It was delicious. After eating we played a couple of board games - Sansoucci and Azul, in case anyone’s into board games - and came home about 1am. Lovely lovely.

This technique helps me get my thoughts out~ Answer: Yes I think I should do this. It might be enlightening. Plus I could use it to talk about in therapy. Thanks for the suggestion.I C&S the last piece of cake 2 this evening. Not because I was craving it but because I need to get rid of it and I can’t bear to just throw it in the bin.
