1,1,therapy,"Therapy 21.04.20 // starting and ending  I really struggle with the start of therapy sessions - moving from that “everyday-life” mindset into the therapy space. And then I struggle again at the end to get back out of the therapy space. I only really registered that it’s difficult both ways last session. I think my therapist thinks I am more aware of the time than I am. I often find I glance at the clock about halfway through the session, but then I get deeper into things and I don’t look at it again. At the end of last week’s session, I was talking about something deep, and then paused to think and then suddenly T was saying “so how about before we end, let’s talk about something lighter… how about you tell me about what you’ve been up to with your family in lockdown”. I was a bit taken aback by the sudden transition from therapy material to surface stuff, and I struggled to find my way out of my head back into the world again. I often feel like I’m far away and the jump back into present time is too hard. I tried to wrestle myself back up to the surface, but in the end I just said to T, “I don’t like it when you do that!” She took that on board and asked me how I would rather end things. “Would you rather just keep on talking about deep things right until the last moment?”  “Noooo…. it just feels like too much of a jump though. Too sudden.” I need her to wrap up what we’re talking about a bit more, even if it’s just saying that we’ll carry on talking about it next week but we need to start bringing things to a close now. I know I am bad at ending on time. I never take responsibility for it. If T doesn’t end the session, I just keep talking. I don’t like the ending, having to leave and not see her for another week. She does have to gently push me out a little bit at the end. She usually does it by talking about scheduling for my next session, and at that point I will take it as my cue to end. But until she moves into that, I figure she’s still willing to sit there and be with me so I just keep going.",session,"Therapy 10.03.20 // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There’s always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week’s list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don’t have a list this week, it’s been too mad and I’m too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn’t get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe 6 weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I’m not quite sure what you’re asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don’t want you to feel trapped in it, like with d1 about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she’s grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you’ve given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She’s almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn’t get enough emotional regulation and so you’re still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you’ve pretty much got that now. Now you’re learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That’s my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she’ll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that’s ok, it’s ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It’s annoying because I’ve got it all written out, so I don’t know why I’m struggling for words. They’re all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I’m closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that’s when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she’d forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn’t remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you’ve picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I’ve had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don’t tell me what it is don’t tell me what it is don’t tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It’s ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that’s what happens in relationships. It’s life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it’s ok for you to tell me if you think I’m losing track, that’s ok, that’s your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it’s my responsibility, that’s why I’m doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I’m not mad. I just want to know that you know where we’re up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don’t really want to have to say all that again.”",talk,"Therapy 3.11.20 // struggling to speak   I’m struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I’d written down. But although they’d felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don’t think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn’t get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren’t really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn’t find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were ‘generational’, did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn’t believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn’t feel like it did. I said that I don’t feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I’m not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don’t need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we’d got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I’d believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after 3 years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it’s not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it’s like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.",felt,"Therapy 23.01.20 // third session in a row talking about termination  We had spent a lot of the session talking about food and weighing, although in a constructive way, not arguing. I remember T saying once that when I push her into a position of having to take authority on food, it makes her feel less connected to me. This wasn’t that position, it was more like gentle nudges and encouragement to do what I know I need to do. T really wants me to learn to trust my body and respond to its needs, rather than have a rigid framework imposed from the outside. I’d like this too but as I told her several times, it’s just Really Scary 😱 “Anyway, I know you don’t like to spend the whole session talking about food, so what shall we use the rest of the time to talk about?” This was when I realised that we were a lot further through the session than I thought we were. T said we could take a bit of extra time at the end so I bravely brought up ending again. This is three weeks in a row we’ve talked about termination, which is quite a massive step, because until now it’s been enough for T to even just mention it and me to freak out. I can now approach the subject myself. I told T that I felt a bit bashed about. She had talked about retiring as if it were going to happen soon, and then the next week said she had no plans to retire. T clarified that she has cut down her working days and stopped taking referrals from a certain place, and with those in place, she is not planning to retire any time soon. I told her that the thought of ending therapy felt like a big black hole opening up inside of me, and I thought I could do it but now we’ve talked about it and made it feel a little more real, I don’t think I can. T said it was ok, and for now we were just thinking about it. It feels like exposure therapy. Ok Faith, first you learnt to tolerate the mention of termination, and next step, you can tolerate a conversation about hypothetical termination, and let’s hold it at that level for now till it feels comfortable enough to move on. T said “One thing is for certain, I will never forget you!” I burst out laughing at that and said “I don’t know if that’s good or bad!” but secretly I was very pleased that T brought it up and said it so confidently.  She said it was definitely good. I know I am her longest term therapy client, and we have been on a real huge meaningful therapy journey together, and I feel for both of us that has given us an experience we haven’t had and won’t have with anyone else. I’ve pushed her skills to the limit sometimes and I’ve probably caused her as many issues in supervision as I’ve had issues with ruptures and behaviours and all that. T talked again about our relationship and said “We have had our ups and downs and been through a lot but you have made so much progress…… You are impossibly different to the person I met with almost eight years ago!” Then she gave me lots of proud smiles. I think I’m done talking about ending for now. It can go back on the back burner for a while. Who knows if 2020 really will be the year I end therapy. It might yet be, or I might be still here five years down the line. I don’t need to know that right now.",bit,"Therapy 22.10.19 // part 2 // weight going down; frustration going up  My therapist said she was trying a different approach this week and trying to help the adult-me get on board with making the decisions, rather than her telling me what to do. She asked me how I was finding it. I was looking down because I was feeling fed up that she wasn’t really getting me, and I muttered  “It’s annoying!” I don’t think T expected that because she sounded a bit taken aback and gave a little laugh and said “oh… right, ok”. I smiled too. It actually was a moment of connection in amongst all the disconnect. She said “How can I be helpful to you? What do you need from me? I want to support the adult part of you to make decisions.” I got frustrated and said “Yes but it doesn’t have to be one extreme or the other!” while gesturing extremes with my hands. I understand that T taking the adult role and telling me what to do, while it has a place at times, is only really a stepping stone to enabling me to look after myself more fully. But at the same time when she completely steps back and refuses to get drawn into that adult role, it feels like she has abandoned me. I sat in silence for quite a long time. Lots was happening in my head. I was feeling frustrated about how things were going. I was wondering why she hadn’t asked about my weight, when we have spent so many sessions talking about it and even last session she spent some time hammering me on eating.  I managed to use the silence quite constructively. I was weighing up in my head whether to just abandon the weight conversation and talk about something else, or whether that would leave things feeling really difficult over my upcoming holiday. I thought to myself, What will be the hardest thing to manage myself next week when I don’t have a session? and the answer came back in my mind that it would be T not knowing my weight and the places my brain/eating disorder might run off to with that. Eventually I spoke, although I avoided eye contact. “Uh…. it bothers me that you still don’t know what I weigh. That I said I was worried about telling you it but now you don’t seem to care whether I tell you it or not! It’s hard for me to tell you it each week and I need to feel like it’s non-negotiable, because that’s sometimes the only way I can make myself write it. So it wasn’t that I didn’t want to tell you it this week, I was just scared of what you would think.” T said that she could pretty much figure out what my weight is from the other things I said about it. She made a guess and I kind of nodded slowly, till she said “lower?” I nodded and she guessed again, correctly this time. I said I didn’t mean it to be that low, I knew I’d missed some meals but I’d also not missed a lot.  “I was honest when I answered your texts about eating. And it did help, you texting me, but then I felt like a terrible person because I implied everything was ok in the texts and then I went and lost a load of weight….. Here I am, supposed to be in recovery and instead I am making all these choices that aren’t in line with that. I’m a terrible person.” T reminded me that recovery is never a straight line and that it’s normal to have some relapses.  She was very determined not to get all parental on me, and I guess I felt uncomfortable with the changed dynamic and just kept trying to prod her back into it. She offered to text me again through the next fortnight to ask how eating was going, but I didn’t feel like I deserved anymore support so I said no.  Despite all that, we ended the session on a good note. It wasn’t a rupture. Just an uncomfortable session with things to think about.",asked,"Therapy 01.10.19 // a shift in approach  
 T said something quite radical to me. She said “I had a thought this week. How would it feel if you were to gain to X, and then just stay there at that weight and see how it felt?” I was a bit lost for words. T has never suggested anything like that before! She knows I am really scared of weighing X. This whole therapy rupture came about because I was only a few pounds off X, and I needed T to hold me there because I was panicking about it, and unfortunately she dropped me instead.  Her suggestion really set off a firework of contradictory thoughts inside me. I will confess there was a part of me that was quite excited by the idea. The thought of this stretch opening up between the weight I am now and X, a whole 7lbs to potentially gain. I liked the idea of a target being that far off, and no longer having to panic when my weight goes up even just one pound from what it is now. It felt like gaining some breathing space from the eating disorder’s tight control. Then of course, straight after that thought came the panic of that was all very well but how will I cope weighing X. My clothes won’t fit. My bones won’t feel so sharp. More fat will creep under my skin.  Even while I was panicking, part of me loves that T made this suggestion. She listened to what I said to her when we had our first conversation about the rupture, that maybe I needed to weigh more [the figure I gave in my rant would put me at a bmi of 23] in order to have healthier thoughts, and that maybe even though I wouldn’t feel so physically comfortable at that weight, maybe I would realise I need to weigh that in order to be free from the eating disorder thoughts.  I think me saying that really shifted her viewpoint. I’ve talked before on here about feeling like T wants me to stay thinner, and T valuing control over our own weight and body size. She has never really pushed me gaining weight and she has talked about not wanting me to get overweight again. But I haven’t been “overweight” for 20 years now, and in those 20 years, and especially the 7 since I’ve been seeing T, my struggles have been much more with restricting and losing weight and weighing too littler. ANYWAY, all that is to say that T suggesting I consider intentionally gaining up to a weight that’s higher than I’ve been maintaining at marks quite a change in her approach. I don’t want to do it but I really like that she suggested it. And I totally see the logic behind it, that I’m terrified of being that weight, yet maybe if I got there and maintained at that weight, the number would lose its power over me. I had all these thoughts in my head during the session, although none of them were quite as clearly formed as I’ve written them out up there. It felt overwhelming, bits of me scared to say what other bits were thinking. Eventually I said to T, “Can we talk about something else please?” T said “Yes, of course. But before we do, can you just tell me what was difficult about that? Was it x or was it y?…. I won’t ask you any more about it, but it would be helpful for me to know.” [I can’t remember what the x and y options were! They might have been something like x was ‘there were too many thoughts in your head and it’s too hard to think about all of them right now’ and y was ‘that’s a terrible idea and I never want to speak of it again’.] I said it was x. T said that was ok and thankyou for telling her, and then she changed the subject just like I’d asked her to. I think everything in this post was the most important part of the whole therapy session.",talking,"Therapy 01.09.20 // Are you on my side?  I had just spoken with T about wondering whether my parents worried about me going off to university at a young age. I felt that T’s response to that was quite invalidating. I can’t remember now exactly what she said but something about not assigning blame and that my parents loved me. It seems like we have done all this work in therapy getting to an acceptance that my parents weren’t perfect, yet now every time I allow myself to express a little spark of anger or even dissatisfaction or sadness over them and their actions, T jumps in and tries to smooth it all over. That just throws me right back to my old thought patterns that clearly my parents were great and it’s me that’s somehow wrong, that the critical part of me that’s rolling her eyes and saying ‘ffs Faith you make such a big deal out of nothing’ is right. “It always feels like you’re defending them” I said to T, in a resigned tone of voice. “Oh no, no I’m not defending them. I’m definitely not defending some of their decisions. I’m definitely not defending them pushing you ahead two years at school.” I shrugged at her. Her intentions and words don’t seem to match up. She said “Maybe we need to talk some more next session about my views of their actions and their relationship with you” I nodded, and said a bit defeatedly “It feels like you’re on their side” “I’m on your side, Faith. I’m definitely on your side.” We were nearly out of time and it felt like she was back-pedalling and trying to end on a reassuring note rather than a rupture. “I’m sorry if it feels like I’m not on your side. I really am. I think that’s another thing that would be good to talk about next week… how does that feel?” I heard her saying that she was on my side. I’m glad she said it so many times because it did help it sink in and gave me something to hold on to. I still feel a bit let down by her though in the way that I brought some feelings to therapy and she shut them down without exploring what was going on for me. She seems so worried that she will damage my relationship with my parents that she won’t hold space for me to say negative things about them. That makes it really hard for me to try and recalibrate my views of them, from them being perfect to a more realistic view that they did their best but they didn’t get everything right.  “I know this is a really horrible place to end” - T emphasised the ‘horrible’ - “but we really are out of time now.” We had already gone ten minutes over to make up for the poor internet connection, which she’d offered earlier in the session, so I know that by the time we finished she did probably have to dash off to her next client or whatever. I just nodded in acceptance and we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. I noticed immediately afterwards that I hadn’t said “thankyou” like I usually do at the end of a session. I guess I was still feeling her lack of attunement. There’s a lot to process in next week’s session.",therapist,"Basic Tenets of Attachment Theory  1. Attachment is an innate motivating force Throughout our entire lifespan from birth to death, humans are hardwired to attach to others. It is not a childhood trait we outgrow, rather it is an innate part of being human. 2. Secure dependence complements autonomy There is no such thing as complete independence from others. There is only effective and ineffective dependency. Effective dependence fosters autonomy and self-confidence, so the more securely connected we are, the more separate and different we can be free to be.  3. Attachment offers a safe haven Predictable physical and emotional connection from an attachment figure calms the nervous system. Positive attachments create a safe haven which offers a buffer against the effects of stress and uncertainty as we face the world and provides the optimal environment for growth. 4. Attachment offers a secure base This positive sense of self coming from a secure connection creates a secure base from which we can explore the world, take risks and develop a sense of competence and autonomy. Having a positive sense of self makes us more able to make more successful bids for connection with others. We come to believe that the world is safe and manageable. 5. Accessibility and responsiveness build bonds Accessibility, responsiveness and emotional engagement (A.R.E.) are the building blocks of attachment bonds. In other words, we are asking our attachment figures “Are you there for me?” 6. Fear and uncertainty activate attachment needs When we are upset by difficult events or negative aspects of life, or we feel insecure in the attachment bond itself our attachment needs for comfort and connection become compelling. They result in the activation of attachment behaviours such as proximity seeking. A sense of connection with an attachment figure is a primary inbuilt emotional regulation device. 7. The process of separation distress is predictable Separation distress arises when an attachment bond is threatened. If attachment behaviours fail to evoke contact and comfort from an attachment figure, a process of angry protest, clinging, depression and despair occurs, culminating in detachment. In secure attachment relationships, protest at inaccessibility is recognised and accepted. 8. A finite number of insecure forms of attachment can be identified If, growing up, people did not have attachment figures who responded to them sensitively, then they adapt one of three different strategies - anxious, avoidant or disorganised - in response to the question “Can I depend on you when I need you?” Anxious attachment is characterised by hypervigilence & neediness, whereas avoidant attachment is characterised by shutting down and avoiding emotional engagement. Disorganised attachment (called Fearful Avoidant in adults) occurs when a person has been traumatised by an attachment figure, which then causes a tremendous conflict as their source of comfort also becomes a source of fear. 9. Attachment involves working models of self and other Securely attached people are comfortable with closeness and the need for others.  They believe others will be dependable and responsive when needed. Their basic relationship strategy is to recognize the need for others and then congruently reach out. Each relationship impacts our working model and contributes to expectations and beliefs which we carry forward into future relationships. Adult-adult bonds are more reciprocal and less dependent on physical closeness. Just thinking about the attachment figure can calm the nervous system. 10. Isolation and loss are inherently traumatising Attachment theory explains why the trauma of deprivation, rejection and loss of attachment figures have such a big impact on us, our personality formation and our ability to handle stresses in life. Taken from “Attachment Theory in Practice” by Susan M Johnson",thought,"Therapy 29.09.20 // processing // part one  I told T it had been a difficult week, and then I wailed a bit about the Covid situation and my weekend anxiety spiral and how I’m still feeling fragile. I told her about doing the covid swabs and how the gagging part is kind of triggering but not in the sense that it makes me tempted to start purging, just that it brings back physical memories. T said she was glad that it wasn’t making me have increased urges to purge. After I’d got all that out of the way, T said “So with all that going on, have you had any time to think about what we talked about last week?”  I fidgeted a bit and stared away and said “Mmm yes, I have thought about it. Uh, yeah….. uh… it felt good, when you said what you would have liked to have said to my parents. That felt like you were on my side, and it’s easier for me to believe my feelings when it feels like you are on my side rather than when you’re staying neutral.”  T nodded. I feel like I’m spoon feeding her this a bit - “I need you on my side for this”. I don’t seem to able to validate my own childhood feelings myself. Probably because I’m still worried about my feelings being “wrong”, which I know comes from childhood where I learnt that mostly my own feelings *were* wrong and what was right was working out what other people’s feelings were. Whatever those were, they were the “right” feelings about the situation. “Um, and then when I was talking about that protocol that I found, for moving into different school years, and you said that it wouldn’t have been around 30 years ago… well then I felt like you were making excuses for them again…” T looked a bit thoughtful and said “Mmm yes… I can see that… “ “I mean, maybe it wasn’t around then, but presumably they wrote it at some point because there was a need for it. To stop children being moved around years in an unmanaged way…. At the end of it, it says that all these people should agree the move - the parents, the headteachers of the school, the educational psychology service… it just seems….” I drifted off into silence, staring into space. “It just seems…” T prompted “Um, it just seems, that there were all these adults involved in making the decision…. like there was me, over here, a child…. and all these adults over there making a decision together and any one of them could have decided that it wasn’t a good idea - but none of them did…”  (A note to my therapy notes, I’m not talking about this to cast blame or assign responsibility. It’s really more about processing all the feelings around it, all the thoughts that come up. I’m not trying to reach any particular position at the end of it, I just want to explore my feelings and say some of the things that I’ve never had a chance to say.) I carried on to say to T that I could have said no, to moving up the second year. My parents did ask me how I felt about it so I did have a chance to say no, and if I’d said no, I’m pretty certain it wouldn’t have happened. However I can’t really blame myself on that front, it’s not surprising that I didn’t say no. I’d received messages all my childhood up till then that being bright and high achieving and doing everything younger than everyone else was a good thing and made adults pleased with me and made me special, so why wouldn’t I have wanted to continue that?",talked,"Therapy 23.02.21 // no change please  We had a slightly awkward start to this session (when do I not have an awkward start?) as I always struggle with those opening lines and how to get going. Also T seemed completely fine and oblivious to the fact that I might be unhappy after last session. I think whether she picks up on it or not, she always opens the session in a neutral way rather than pulling in the mood that the previous session ended in. That gives me the option of picking up from last session, or starting with something fresh. I’m going to try and write in a way that shows how we repaired our rupture. I guess anyone in a long term therapy relationship experiences ruptures and they probably all get repaired slightly differently depending on the therapist and the client and the situation.  “Can we talk about last weeks session?” I asked haltingly. T was still all happy and I think oblivious to the fact that all was not well after last week. She nodded and said “Yes of course” and then waited. “Uh… so when you said what you said about therapy changing…” - T nodded and remembered what she’d said - “well, why did you say that?” “Well it was an observation I suppose. It’s good to notice how therapy is going.” “Mmm… It felt like you were saying you wanted to change things.” T said that she thought it was more that she was noticing things that had already changed. She talked about when I’d had the episode with my neighbour that upset me, and how I had known that I was triggered because it reminded me of my dad. “That’s when I thought, oh Faith is further along here that I’d realised. She doesn’t need me to make the connection for her anymore.” I said how scary talk of change is for me and how it unsettles me that T might change things in therapy. T repeated that maybe what she really meant was that she had noticed I had made progress and so there had already been change, and she needed to move with it. That’s what she had meant when she said it, rather than she wanted to deliberately make a change from how we were doing things now. I felt reassured on that front and some of that fear that she was going to deliberately engineer sessions to be somehow different started to ease. After about 20 minutes of conversation, I paused and T asked if we had covered that now. “Shall we park it there now…. or do you want to keep talking about it?” I was so not done with talking about it! I still had a lot of thoughts that I hadn’t said yet. Little did T know! It took me a minute to get the words out, “I think I need to keep talking about it”"
2,2,shit,"Question: I’ve never felt this alone in my entire life.All my friends left for college and I’m still in this shithole.I’m more suicidal and self hating than ever before and everytime I try to tell them how I feel they use humor or try to brush it off. honestly I’m so  desperate for any form of affection or validation,even if it is just someone listening to my whining.I really miss them but they’re too busy.Your blog makes me feel a bit better tho.Ur energy radiates positivity  Answer: :( im so familiar w/ this boat. after high school i slowly lost all my friends 1 by 1, lost most of them to bad drugs (and brain damage) but lost my absolute best friend to college (and a new set of friends). the older you get, i feel like the more egocentric people tend to get, and the less sympathetic “friends” tend to be. ppl just get increasingly more involved with themselves. to the point where they arent even capable of caring or thinkin abt anything but themselves. i talk to exactly 1 person from high school and she used to be a “best friend” but she only wants to talk to me when its about herself, now. she’ll only hang out with me when she’s “off again” with her “ex”boyfriend. whenever i talk about my feelings, she ignores me or finds a way to make it about herself. or laughs it off. i know this is a common theme for a lot of people and not just you and me. its also hard to get ppl to take you serious when they’re uncomfortable with a topic. i wish people would grow the fuck up , so many people are so uncomfortable with discomfort - if that makes sense. you voice your pain/discomfort and ppl immeadiately shut down, ppl dont know what to say or do anymore so they just make jokes and they dont rly engage. eventually you give up trying to have a connection with them and then you  just end up lonely n desperate. you cant talk to any of your “friends” abt how lonely n isolated u feel bc theyll just hit u with the “bUt u hAvE mEeE” lmao. and then theyll stop replying 5 min later.. LOL. right. it sucks bc ur trying to decide whether you should hold shit against them or not. bc on one hand theyre neglecting the friendship, but on the other hand people get busy and its not fair to hold being too busy against them. u CAN hold being an absent friend against them tho. busy or not, ppl who care make time for one another. ppl who care make an effort to listen to how you’re doing.. i miss my friends sometimes too, lol. havent talked to my childhood best friend in over a year now. but its for the best. i was patient with them n they all disappointed me. people grow apart naturally, if thats whats happening, try not to let it eat u alive. it means you’re evolving, even if you’re the one stuck at home. im sorry u feel so isolated right now. its not a fun way to feel. the best advice i can give is to focus on refining urself for the time being. keep urself busy becoming a better person. friends come and go and we all evolve/outgrow people but the next time a friend comes along, you could be the difference in their life. you could be the friend for that person that you’ve been needing all this time. you can be the empathetic ear that makes the time for them, and listens when they need you to. if you can do this for other ppl, it might make u feel a lil better.. and they might return the friendship. dont expect much, tho. ppl r fickle pickles. i try n befriend coworkers n stuff bc it makes me feel better. ppl like to be listened to so if i can just like listen to my coworkers and i mean RLY listen and offer support, they LOVE that and it makes ppl love u, yano. people dont always return the favors, you might not always have someone to go to, but at least you know you’re giving everyone everything you can. you can be your own friend. theres knowledge and wisdom and power in silence. you just gotta get a bit more comfortable with it. being alone isnt the worst thing in the world, especially when you have a vivid interior to keep yourself amused. im glad my blog makes u feel a little better and i hope ur able to feel peaceful n calm this week, hang in there buddy",ur,"clarinetplayingpenguin:

 Rip 

 I don’t want to be the biggest sibling and the biggest friend.  

 ‘you got skinny!’ is tactless as fuck. people. shouldn’t. say that. ‘I can fit my hand all the way around your waist’ um if you’re that thin you’re seriously SERIOUSLY ill. like your muscles are wasted away you probably can’t even stand. also who the fuck would just grab your waist like that. Jealous stares - no. concerned stares. are they ok stares. what happened to that poor girl/boy stares. size XXS and size 00 - clothing sizes are always changing and these sizes are often based on models who starve themselves throw up and are airbrushed to hell and back. ‘you can sit on my lap’ again what the fuck. why do so many of these read like some pedo is saying them. nobody says that. nobody has ever casually told me ‘oh yeah hey sit on my lap’. that just isn’t a thing people do unless it’s your best friend or significant other, in which case you can be any damn size, they still think you’re stunning and love you. beautiful in anything: on a practical level no, everyone has their own individual style and look and colours that complement them which has nothing to do with weight. also if you’re extremely skinny yes maybe you have that ethereal elfin thing and yes we’re conditioned to believe skinny is beautiful because society is garbage (and there’s nothing wrong with being skinny of course you’re beautiful regardless) but anorexic thin - you might feel beautiful but sweetheart you’re ill. you’re dangerously ill. you need help. please get help. ‘you’re so light/I’ll give you a piggyback ride’ again weird weird creepy weird do you people not get it these are not things people say to you in normal life it doesn’t matter what size you are this really is not a conversation that people have. confidence in dressing rooms: dressing rooms are horrible environments clothing sizes are constantly changing the lighting is terrible if you’re not feeling confident you’re no different from 95% of people you’re not ugly I swear. also if you’re ill you won’t feel confident. anorexia is an illness. bikini body: I can’t even begin to describe how much I hate this. One: if you’re this skinny you’ll probably be very sensitive to sunlight you shouldn’t expose yourself. Two: literally nobody on the beach cares, unless they’re an actual asshole from hell. Three: bikinis are a ridiculous concept anyway which allow women to body shame each other. wrists/collarbones/slender legs/thigh gaps: all symptomatic of SERIOUS DANGEROUS weight loss. also bruising constantly, never being able to get comfy. this is a look which suggests illness and pain and desperation. it is not a goal (side note if you are slender naturally and have some of these features I’m not shitting on you - if this is your body type and you are healthy it’s FINE) ‘You look like a model!’ refer to my earlier point about models being anorexic often and airbrushed etc. ‘how did you do it?’ you became ill. plain and simple. it’s not discipline or health or goals, it. is. illness. ability to feel confident in your own skin - fuck off. fuck right off there. just get out. confidence comes from so many things. the love of your family, a beloved pet, your friends, your skills, the knowledge that you have a beautiful smile, that you are intelligent, kind, funny, gentle, accomplished. not this. not a terrible, tragic illness that should NEVER be romanticised ever because it is so unbelievably toxic. not from a thinspo blog caught in the vicious circle of illness unhappiness and expressing that through encouraging others down the same path. never. NEVER. tl;dr these blogs and post are written by people with a serious illness trying to trap others in the same illness. it’s not their fault, they might not mean any harm but they are ill. not goals. ill. As someone who has narrowly avoided going down this path several times, I can’t even begin to describe how harmful and toxic this kind of thing is. I’m sorry you’re ill, I’m sorry you’re going through this but please for the love of god. Stop trying to spread it to other people.  

 rb for @clarinetplayingpenguin’s comment, they went OFF. read for sustenance. noteworthy ideas: #NOTGOALS, & stop spreading toxicity within the community.",fucking,"been havin intrusive “dont eat” thoughts lately because its literally the only part of my life that i can control (or rather, cant control sometimes depending on how much money i do and dont spend on other things) 
 im sick of my dad belittling me and telling me i dont know anything about shit and going into my garden and ripping shit up/taking shit down/changing things that i know i need. you literally cant tell me im a dumbass that doesnt know what im doing. i know that these plants need to be at 75 degrees. but go ahead keep turning off and now breaking MY ac units when im away from home. ill just let my plants fry at 90 degrees because dad says so and doesnt think that air conditioning is necessary in a literal fucking sauna in the summer 
 like im supposed to be getting along with him because im stuck at his house, stuck driving one of his old banged up discarded cars to school, stuck GOING to school because he payed for classes and now im obligated to not waste his money, stuck with fried ass plants that wont make me any money because hes been sabotaging my garden for the past 2/3 months every time i go to sleep or leave the house for more than 30 minutes. i literally cant do any better for myself rn and i cant relocate and things arent TERRIBLE here but i would STILL rather fucking kill myself or kill him before i go back to feeling like an autonomy-less fucking child that he insists on treating me like. im sick of him trying to control every aspect of my life and treat me like im a clueless fucking idiot. the hypocrisy is so fucking real its making me mad. im still miserable. i dont care how “proud” my family is of me for “doing the right conventional thing” i think its fucking stupid as fuck that i have to perform these tricks and jump thru stupid ass fucking hoops just to make anyone proud. i dont even want the pride. or the family. i dont want any of this shit anymore i dont want responsibility for a ghetto ass half ass garden that i cant even keep regulated and thats not gonna yield me any results. i dont even fucking want this laptop he just bought me 
 ive been getting by with outdated technology and cheap stuff that i could afford myself for years but it was putting me behind in school not having a working laptop or printer. and he handed my brother EVERYTHING he has. for the entirety of his life my brother has been a spoiled brat and all the $$ my dad makes went into my brother’s hobbies and wants and gifts.  
 the last thing i want to sound like is ungrateful because im not. i cant even believe how nice the laptop is, ive wanted an msi forever. obviously i love it but ive had it for a day and im already realizing id rather not even have it just because of the implications of owing him. i cant even fucking stand him. one moment hes reasonable and the next he’s making me want to commit murder because his cognitive dissonance is so thick is suffocates me.  
 so now i have this nice ass laptop that i feel guilty and ashamed of for even having. i feel undeserving. like my only worth is to perform well at school so the family can be at peace knowing im “oN tHe riGhT pAtH”. my happiness or my sanity or my interests will never fucking matter or be a good enough reason to earn anything whether it be respect or a laptop. its only ever about how things “SEEM to be going”. so as long as i can SEEM like im doing fine, everything in my dad’s small, dumbass world, are. but im not doing fine. im still self harming. im actually self harming more frequently lately than i have in a long run of years. im still brimming with rage because nobody ever listens to me and when i do speak i get told im wrong and or unwise and or ungrateful and or inexperienced and or just plain fucking stupid. im over it. im sick of trying to appease a bunch of people who make my skin crawl. i dont care if its family and they “love me and want the best for me”. theyre all fucking stuck in their ways with piss and shit for brains and any complaint about unhappiness or discord in the home just gets shut down and band-aid’ed with “buh buh but!!! scKOOL!!! it will give u sense of PurPosE” “buh but focus on the GUD IN UR LIFE (which is… btw..?)” “buh buh heres an excuse as to why your grown ass father can act like an immature damaged joke of a human but you’re required to grow personally and gracefully until the point where youve done SO MUCH personal growth that you realize that life is still futile regardless and you eventually snap and off yourself!!!” 
 if i kill myself now or if i kill myself down the line the result is just gonna be the same and i dont know why or how i put effort into leading my life anyways and suffering for now when i know in my heart of hearts that i want to go at my own hand and im probably going to still feel the same way no matter how many years pass.  
 
 
 sorry if this bothers anyone or concerns anyone (pls dont b lol) but i have nowhere else to say this and no friends to take this to and my boyfriend is obviously still useless when it comes to providing emotional support so here i am 
 
 idk all i can think about is “if u dont eat youll feel better” and i know that ill get some sort of sick sense of satisfaction but i also know how pointless self sabotage is. but when every other aspect of ur life feels sabotaged outside of ur control, then does it rly matter? 
 today i havent denied myself any food. i spent the last of the money i had on food. but thats.. thats it.  
 i have no more money rn so i dont even have the means to eat. i wanna be clear here that my dad does NOT pay for everything, he payed for my schooling only (3 classes at a community college, he practically BEGGED me to go) and he purchased me a laptop to aid in my schooling. yes i have a financial safety net (tbh if ur gonna MAKE kids thats kinda ur job until theyre self sufficient but anyways) im still responsible for feeding and taking care of my animals and myself and paying all my own bills, electricity included. so yeah. food is lookin like a no go right now.  
 i have a 4 hour class tomorrow from 6 to 10 pm. im gonna see if i can make it through the day without eating because once i feed myself THEN i get hungry. if i just abstain entirely i can get over the hunger.  
 i have noticeably gained weight and i am extremely uncomfortable in my body right now. im used to my stomach being perfectly flat and now i have a bit of body fat on me so i feel like ive been spilling out of my pants the past few weeks. its not a good feeling. i have no means to comfort myself rn so maybe getting my body back to how im used to it being will bring me comfort. i always thought i wanted to put on a few lbs and fill out more but now that i have i feel totally out of place in my skin. i hate having to be hyperaware of sucking my stomach in. once you get used to having a flat stomach i guess you take it for granted. the self consciousness and a lack of funds for food have me feelin like this week is about to be a long one. theyre all long. i just want a break. i just want to feel happy and comfortable with my life and with my plants situation and my decisions but im not gonna while im living here. im gonna be stuck in this shitty ass spot for as long as it takes for me to get through college, hone an entire craft that idek if im passionate about, and then find another 9 to 5 thatll probably have more cons than pros to showing up and wasting away at for 8 hours a day even if im “doing what i love”. what i love is to go about my life unbothered. what i would love, is to not have to participate in this rat race at all. what if i dont want to have a purpose. what if ive already accepted my wasted potential and im perfectly happy doing nothing????",ed,"Question: You’re so nice for always taking the time to share meal ideas and answer question from you personal experience.Literally you’re the only reason why I didn’t delete this app.you gave me a burst of courage to get vegan pizza for lunch today and small things like this many times that just add up together and help me make more and more progress daily.Sometimes I want to delete this app cause it can be quite triggering but I like reading your answers too much Answer: first of all im so surprised n shocked .. at this, but im very grateful!!!enough bout me tho bECAUSE heres wat i wanna emphasize vry hard!! if u wanna delete this fuckening app - DELETE IT. youll be SO much better off. if anyone ANYONE ever feels inclined to step away from social media - PLEASE DO IT. i do it regularly. i need to, for my sanity. you can always delete your tumblr mobile app and just not log in if youre unsure. if you know deletion is gonna be ur liberation, go u, and dont hesitate. literally just msg me for my snapchat and we can be homies n just keep in touch that way. if u ever have somethin on ur mind dont feel like ur bothering me by contacting me personally. i dont have many friends. i have like 3 real friends and my boyfriend and every one of those ppl is an adult and extremely busy in life so i dont rly have many ppl to talk to. i get busy too but im not cool enough to not have time to get to know ppl who i obviously can have meaningful connections with. thats why im here yano?. sure as shit not here for the thinspo ahahahaaha:’)just somethin to think on. i know its nice being able to see what other peoples concerns and thoughts are. thats why i always take the time to answer, bc im genuinely interested too. not many of us have people irl we can go to about this shit, and even the people who do - are probably rly unconfortable approaching it irl anyways even if they have the option. and i hate that. im an open book bc ultimately i learn from my mistakes and its a good honest way to live yano.a rly good lil piece of advice someone on here gave me b4 was to just start unfollowing ppl and unfollowing tags that grind my gears. so obvious and simplistic. i was lettin myself get rly worked up over dumb shit but that was a ncie reminder that i can control my virtual realms and how i can react to things. tumblr is a complicated space especially for someone whos vulnerable.  im to a point where i know i can hold myself accountable so i feel comfortable being on tumblr knowing it isnt going to hinder my progress. but you know yourself best. and if you think a break, and a clean headspace is what you need - away from digital cages …. plZ. listen to ur intuition. do it. dont lose ur momentum. and hmu bc ill send u my snap i jst dnt wanna post it publicly bc it is my (only) personal snap xx",recovery,"1:54am  im getting sick. probably caught something at college because all those fucking kids are nasty, coming to school under the weather coughing and sneezing up in a sealed ass classroom. 0 regards for anyones wellbeing but their own. and its impossible to sanitize my hands every time i would need to. 
 sorry. pet peeve is people who spread germs. stay the fuck home if you dont feel good or if any of your orifices are leaking. some of us have compromised immune systems/heavy workloads/busy schedules/no health insurance and cant afford to be sick. i go out of my way to avoid getting sick. and generally im pretty good at it. have gone years and years without catching a single bug. but leave it to a college campus, a cesspit of shit, to finally get me.  
 whats most upsetting is that i cant get any food today. i had my last can of soup way earlier, well… only half. rationing the other half for tomorrow. and i can tell that the lack of food is only making me feel worse. ive gotten progressively more sick as they day goes on. i spent most of the day in bed because even being upright in a chair was a bit exhausting. now i can barely move my body. my temperature is fluctuating wildly. i feel like i wasted my entire day. well. actually. i did. i still have to get my ass downstairs to water a few plants. im just so tired. i just wish i was smarter about the last few years of my life so i wouldnt be in this position. but alas. here i am. dealin with it.  
 i keep trying to tell myself that hunger is only a temporary feeling, and it comes in waves. but man, these waves almost have me on my ass. im so sick of fighting againsg nausea. worst feeling in the world. if my teeth werent fucked id be initiating my own vomit as to make myself feel better faster, and just get it out, but its futile.  theres nothing to even bring up.  
 chills. sweats. nausea. chills. sweats. nausea. just riding these waves. there goes my entire week. frustrated with a lot of things right now but ive done so much typing today that i just need to stop. elaborating isnt going to solve anything. i just need to get my plants taken care of and not pass the fuck out and ill be okay. cant wait for the day that im financially stable and can afford to have food in my house at all times. sick of having to sacrifice my own nutrition. i dont mind putting my animals first and feeding them first, that doesnt bother me. i will ALWAYS find a way to feed my animals and make sure they have their medicine until the bittetsweet end. but its disheartening not being able to eat because bills come first. if i keep going like this ill die and i wont be able to pay my bills or take care of my animals.  probably gonna go weigh myself on the way to the garden since the scale is down there. out of morbid curiosity. probably gonna be disappointed. always am. i can tell ive lost again. which is unsettling.  it sucks not being happy with your body no matter what you weigh. 75 lbs, im unhappy because i feel too skinny and weak and my brain functioning starts getting inhibited. doesnt feel good. 100 lbs, and im unhappy because i feel too squishy and slow. it takes a lot of fucking food to even get to that point, which makes me feel gluttonous n awful because i loathe the feeling of food digesting especially lots of it at once. i tell myself weight gain is what i want, and then ultimately it just doesnt feel right. and then everything else in between, i still feel unsettled in my own skin. ill tell myself i need to gain, and then i do, and i hate it. so ill lose, and ill hate that too. theres no winning. i wish proanas ( even the ones who dont realize they are ) would shut the fuck up and listen to what i have to say for once. i wish people understood that they dont actually want this. what you see on the surface of skinny, is not the reality behind skinny. literally i would give anything just to be a healthy weight and not have to agonize so hard over this. but the people who need to hear that, absolutely will not listen lmao.",ass,"1:00am  so the guy that so politely informed me of his attraction last night 🙄 apologized today and invited me to a local glassblowing show slash concert today ….. so i went. i wanted to try getting out of the house. we were supposed to trim but he postponed that til tmrw. hes kind of an asshole im realizing so i just spent my entire night flirting with girls and collecting numbers of the “hot chicks” that rejected him already LOL. go ahead try n make me feel bad because i cant figure out how to dance to this jam band, fine. if i “have to move in order to stand here”…. ima just be right back ima go compliment lucy’s boots. sorry i dont like old people music. kiss my ass old man. its exhausting spending your entire night clapping back at someone even if you’re good at it and its all in good fun.  
 anyhow… met some new interesting people. one of which is an award winning grower … holy smokes LITERALLY best pot ive smoked in my life ever AND i got this ole man to follow me back on ig. this guy was like 50 years old and i got a crush on him after spending 15 min talking to him fml:(. i feel like im never gonna find a dude whos mature so ima just save my crushes for ppl my parent’s age i guess.  
 and thats all ill ever have is crushes bc i still got the ole ball n chain comin home from cali next month 
 honestly im relieved to just have a familiar face back around and assholery that i know how to predict n deal with. i cant handle foreign assholery, it throws me off because i dont know where it stems from or when its gonna happen so i can avoid it 🙄 glad i didnt decide to throw my relationship out the window for some pathetic cheapshot lol. i guess i cant call him cheap, he did buy my ticket tonight and drinks and gave me some weed n wax n donated $20 to this pretty vendor girl’s beauty table so she gave me a free facial cleanser and lip balm in exchange :’) 
 i guess tonight was good because i met some pretty and nice girls but man do i get crowd anxiety at concerts now to the point where i cant even move let alone sway let alone dance even though i know how lmao :’) i feel really shitty being called out on it by this dude. im dwelling on it. its like bro i never know when my ex is gonna appear and punch me in the back of the head ITS HAPPENED BEFORE AT A CONCERT SO U NEVER FUCKINF KNOW WITJ MY LUCK pls just give me a break im trying so hard to be normal and sociable and relaxed.   its not nice to keep ditching n distancing urself from someone in public who has social anxiety just bc they “look weird for not dancing” but i cant expect ppl who dont mean shit to me and arent close to me to accomodate my trauma n mental issues. ugh. whatever ive embarrassed myself way harder in front of this pos and he still wants to have sex with me so i dont know why im beating myself up over this.  
 ima stay focused on the nice interactions i had with approx 2 men and 10 women. thank god women exist. theyre so intuitive and forgiving they can like sense and soothe my anxious soul, literally the girls i met tonight are what helped me keep it together.  
 gonna play some red dead to wear my brain out so i can sleep n be ready to see him again tmrw to trim. ufhggg. didnt eat today and i feel like trash. gonna get up and fix myself some cereal soon but im so sapped of all my energy i feel like i cant move from this chair",bc,"Question: I think u look good! Also a lot of what photographs good nowadays have heavy facetuning and filters and who knows What else.. dont listen to that anon ❤️❤️ u do have wonderful bone structure  Answer: i can count on one, MAYBE two hands, the amount of followers/ppl i follow that dont facetune their photos. cameras are just too hd now they pick up too much detail while simultaneously only capturing one 2-dimensional perspective. its rough out here for any one of us just tryna fit in a take a damn selfie. i dont blame ppl for facetuning because i know where the desire to feel adequate comes from, but the way the “shopped standard” distorts ppls expectations and observations when they aren’t the wiser… well thats annoying, sure. i feel bad like im rly not tryna be a bitch to anyone for no good reason but yeah kinda backhanded even if it wasnt intentional.  idk maybe english wasnt even their first language. in that case i would be a bitch… :/ its just the one thing people irl have always complimented me on is my “high cheekbones, sharp jawline, proportional features” etc. like brah pls dont try n make me second guess myself n what i got. thats all.  :’)))) im already aging rapidly bc im white and ive smoked so much and ive had so much stress in my lifetime like im already uneasy about my appearance changing and my goddamn marionette lines n nasolabial folds comin in when im only this young so i dont really need to hear anything about my appearance even if its just makeup suggestions idk.  my face has plenty of dimension i have 2 in crater dark circles under my eyes.  :’ ) thanks for stickin up for me its really not necessary but i appreciate the reassurance.  ugh.  im probably overreacting if im gonna put my face out there i should probably be able to let dumb comments n criticisms roll of my back. i guess i just take things way too personally. i recognize everyone on the internet for being their own real live whole ass individual wherever they are in the world.  i take that into consideration when i look at their pages, read about their life, look at their photos, and reach out to them. i dont just see them as an account, or some.. distant amalgamation of pixels. idk this is not my week lol. lately ive been trying not to react to people or engage them when im in a low mood but i slipped up last night blah. whatever can always delete these later. i appreciate u anon thanks for letting me brain vomit to ur compliment and thank u for bein considerate",fuck,"dumbpoliticalposts:

 me reading someone’s about and not seeing their race / ethnicity, then seeing a “longer about” link and click on that and STILL not seeing anything about their race or ethnicity 

 As someone who grew up with the internet, in the huge era of online safety campaigns, and the constant drilling in of not sharing your personal information online because it’s not safe. I will say this:

No one, not one single person, on the internet owes you their personal information.

What I share on my blog, is shared out of a choice, because that’s a decision I chose to make. Because I talk frequently on neurodivergence and sexuality, and I know I have followers who connect with that.

But I don’t owe people that information.

Strangers on the internet are never entitled to know:

Your name.
Your gender.
Your age.
Your date of birth.
Your location: City, State, Country, wherever. 
Your religion.
Your ethnicity (your culture, your nationality)
Your race (skin colour)
Your mental health.
Your physical health.
Your sexuality.

Your anything at all.

That information is personal. If you choose to share it, that’s your choice, but it is nobody elses right to have it, or demand it, or to manipulate it out of you.

If someone chooses not to share that. That is not some neferious plot. 

This is something important to understand, especially for young people on the internet. Kids in highschool. Your information is your own personal right. Keeping that safe, keeps you safe online. 

We’re in this very questionable internet scape where your information can be taken, and searched, and found. Where there are people who can dox you because they had access to basic information that lead them to deeper info. Where one bit of information can be used to make a smear campaign against you. Or used to target harrassment.

(This is also a really shady time where our information is being quietly sold through advertisers, and taken by data breeches, and DDOS attacks. Where there’s literal fuckin nazi’s on this site that tumblr doesn’t seem to care about because apparently breasts are worse?????)

This is why protecting your privacy and safety was such a huge campaign.

Everyone on the internet is a stranger. And yeah, imma cry ‘stranger danger’ here cause that’s what I grew up with, that’s what I was taught as computers became the big thing, and I was growing up on forums and chat messengers at a super young age where I was incredibly vulnerable. And i’m very lucky to have not encountered what some people I know did.

A/S/L was the most frequent question people would ask, and no it’s not american sign language. Age/Sex/Location. People wanted your info.

You do not need to share that information with anyone. 

There’s another good post on this topic here more focused on sharing age.

There’s a huge difference between sharing your interests and hobbies and fandoms and the general knowledge ‘trivia’ of yourself in an ‘about’ page, VS sharing the entirety of your personal information.

So if someone just has their name, age, and pronouns, but doesn’t list anything else beyond their music interests and fave bands. That’s not malicious, that’s not nefarious. That’s exercising a right to choose what you share.

They don’t owe anyone an indepth analysis of their gender. They don’t owe anyone the knowledge of where they live. They don’t need to reveal if they have a disability or not. They’re just 21 yr old Vera, who likes music and wants you to use they when refering to them.

Protect your information on the internet. 

Be safe on the internet.

And don’t let anyone pressure you, or guilt you, into sharing information you don’t want to share. 

 my personal fave from this sort of “Im checking your race to see if your allowed your opinion” shite is that what’ll happen is they’ll look, see I am Scottish and assume I am White and then proceed to lecture me about the demographic evils of my country and how we lack proper representation because media thing X…even though they felt confident enough to assume my race/ethnicity because they know Scotland is basically white as driven snow. 


 Basically get fucked op. 

 OP: “I’m in the right, dumb stupid white people.” 
 Also OP: has deleted the original post. Has replies turned off for the screen shot post. Has anon asks turned off.  

 Basically, OP needs to get off their high horse and just admit they think race is the most important thing about a person 

 @birthcharts seems kinda racist to me… 

 What if you talk a lot about your town and your sexuality, but are one of a few people of your race in said town and are in the closet publicly? If you keep your race a secret you can keep your anonymity AND speak freely on important local issues. If you drop that you are the sole colored gay in 300 miles suddenly your whole business is public.  - or we could just walk around with armbands so yall can have the fascist state that you really want. 
 I disclose my shit when it’s pertinent but other than that I assume it doesn’t matter, I’m not reading peoples blogs thinking “wow i wish this person listed their race and pronouns so I could judge them immediately like I do in real life cause I’m an ultra racist shitbag like that“",gonna,"soakedbrain:imtrying-butimpissed:The super shitty thing about eating disorders, especially the restrictive types, is that when you are deep enough in it, youre proud of your suffering because that becomes the only thing youre good at. What a sad fucking life. To do nothing but suffer and then turn around and say ha yay I did it lol  To do literally nothing, offer nothing to anyone, change and help no one, just sit there and cause yourself to suffer. And think youre winning in life That is a VERY frightening place to be in and even harder place to crawl out of. A very sad, tiny little world to be in. Triggers in recovery are normal as fuck. I get those often. I feel sad for the numbers I gained. The clothes I no longer fit. People around me talking triggers nonstop. Seeing someone who is obviously disordered is triggering and its normal to think remember the days? I should go back .Back to what? Purposeful suffering? And literally NOTHING else? Because????? I have to remind myself I do not want my only skill in life to be self sabotage. I do not want to only know how to hurt myself and nothing else. Because Im capable of other shit and I have other skills and I can give more to those around me when Im an actual multidimensional human being and not just a darkened smear in the background of my own life.  Eating disorders are fucking stupid. Get the hell out of iti remember scrolling down the ed recovery tag back in december, when my relapse was getting worse by the day, but i could still say at least i wasnt depressed, i hadnt lost my will to live, then, though i knew it was only a matter of time - a couple of weeks at most. this post hit close to home back then. this fucked up sense of achievement was always transient and it felt ever more unsubstantial the deeper i fell into my ed, but i could never let the memory of it go. soon enough everything felt so much more hellish and miserable, and i was dragging everyone down that dark, hopeless road to nowhere with me because anorexia had completely taken over my life. eventually i wished i would die because i didnt know how else i could make it all stop.ive been in recovery again for the past week. i couldnt exactly remember what was written in this post but i felt the need to look for it again a few days ago, and ive found it worded one of the biggest reasons why ive committed to recovery and why its been worth all the hardships in a very piercing way.thank you for this. i know ill keep coming back to this post. 
I adore you and will be here for you in your recovery journey.",lol,"orchidsbloomagain-deactivated20:recoveryfriend:recoveryfriend:your thinspo blog isn’t “just for you” if it’s a public blog. if a person in recovery who can be hurt by seeing thinspo is easily able to see your blog and become triggered by it, then you have FAILED at your useless stance of “not pro, just for me.”knock it off. if it’s “just for you” then make your blog private. and if you can’t make it private because you find yourself living for the validation of publicly posting your eating disorder progress and being praised for it, then you need to own up to that fact that you ARE pro-ana and you actively contribute to pro-ana mentality. and then say it with your chest so we can all go and block you. maybe this isn’t the ~recovery positivity~ you’re looking for. that’s fine with me. we’re looking at and dealing with an extremely deadly disorder, and the people actively promoting it are doing lasting damage to all who are hurt by it. it should be met with anger and outrage. my ~positivity~ isn’t for the people who are harming others, it’s for the people who need to be soothed from the damage dealt by the former. People who run this sort of blog are also unfortunately fond of tagging their (usually extremely triggering!) content with something like pro recovery or recovery positive- as if that makes it any better or less pro-ed. Rendering tags similar to those, which could reasonably be a good place to put or look for actual recovery content, useless and actively harmful for recovering people. Stop pretending what you’re doing is okay. A tag like that doesn’t change anything about you or your content."

 It is now mid-October, the air is crisp and fresh with the smell of fallen leaves and rain. Leaves in varying hues of amber, golden yellow, scarlet, and warm orange are collected in clusters along the sidewalks and curbs. Amidst the rain and wind, they tumble gracefully from the trees in solo dances. The city’s energy is different, as it always is in the fall.  
 You sit in your favourite mocha leather armchair in the corner of the coffee shop a few blocks from your apartment. As you watch the crowds of people with umbrellas and raincoats rush by through the glass, you sip an aromatic latte, warm with the smell of pumpkin and spices. Your long, thin legs are crossed in front of you, easily fitting on the chair. Your delicate frame is kept warm by a soft, oversized sweater that falls off of your shoulder, accentuating your protruding collarbones and poised neck. Your beautiful long hair is tied up in a bun and you wear glasses that frame your eyes, which now look bigger and more innocent on your beautifully defined face. 
 Reaching over to pick up your book from the table next to you, you catch the eyes of a cute boy, a year or so older than you. He is tall, muscular, has soft brown hair and warm olive skin. You can’t help but smile, looking down out of shyness, then back at him. He turns away to order his coffee, and you go back to opening your book. About a page in, the boy comes up to you and makes a comment about the book that you are reading. Soon enough, you are deep in conversation with him and feel completely comfortable.  
 You are no longer self conscious about a swollen belly or thick legs. You now have a perfectly visible thigh gap while wearing black leggings, and your arms are delicate and small. Instead of looking fat and dorky in a big sweater, you look cute and cozy. The boy obviously notices that you are cute, and when he asks for your number, you can’t help but think that all of that work and pushing was worth it. Skipping meals, constricting calories, working out consistently, lying to people about eating, and fighting binges; All of the pain has finally paid off and you have been rewarded for your efforts. 
 Back to school, apple picking, pumpkin patches, bonfires, halloween costumes & parties, cuddling to keep warm at football games. You want to be thin enough to enjoy all of these things when they come.  
 Keep pushing, stay safe, remain strong. It will all be worth it in the end.

4,4,eat,"I am still afraid of some foods because, even though i need to, i am afraid of gaining weight.
 
 Tw! Weight talk I am afraid of gaining weight because of various reasons, but mostly because it will be seen by my brain as lack of control, but i know i need to and i fight against this mentality daily because: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

 NOTHING  WRONG WITH GAINING WEIGHT, no problemo at all, but some days, like today, it feels like there is and i get nervous and anxious about a future body where i weight 5 kilos more.  Days like these are really draining honestly, there’s a pit in my stomach because i feel bad with myself because i only ate junk food or a thing with “way to many calories” and i have to constantly remind myself that:
a) IT DOESN´T MATTER, i am fine, i need those foods, i like those foods, therefore i eat them. 
b) The thought “one won’t hurt” “this thing won’t make me gain x kilos” is completely dumb. What if that item of food did make me gain a whole ten kilos? What about it? What’s so wrong with it? 

I write it with no problem but accepting it is very hard, today i did well, i ate against my ed, but when a day like today hits where the more i eat the more anxious and self conscious i feel, i tend to avoid certain foods which is NOT OKAY, OKAY ME? There was a time in my life where eating junk food was another walk in the park, i miss those days and i want them back, so i have to continue with positive reaffirmations that i am valid and fine even after i ate those high caloric foods. 

At the end of the day, today was just a bad day, with really big victories!, but a bad day still, and like i said in a previous post i can’t get mad at myself because recovery isn’t linear and i am allowed to not feel my best all of the time. These feelings of self consciousness after eating “bad” food won’t go away today, but if i reassure myself tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that, maybe they will :)",food,"September here I come
 
 I know, okay I know that binge eating is not solved by restriction, but I cannot gain any more weight.  I’m thinking back to the times in my life when I remember having a more normal relationship with food. Half of high school was awful food-wise, but for most of college (except the summer) I really felt like I was cured. I approached food as something I needed to stay full during classes, and dining halls were only open during certain hours so I had three meals a day, of food already prepared for me. And, I walked around a lot—I was a lot more active throughout a normal day. I remember still comparing my body with other girls’ bodies, and comparing plates, but for the most part, I really just didn’t care. I ate to stay full, and I ate only what I wanted (dining hall food was mediocre on any given day, anyways). I was also around friends every day, and was studying and working almost constantly. And I ended college comfortable in my body, satisfied enough with my weight, and relatively stable mentally. The only times I relapsed to bingeing were when I thought that I could try to drop my weight further (usually brought on by seeing other people who lost weight, or being around athletes, as was common at my college).  So rather than focus on everything that I’ve read and watched about how to cure binge eating, I’m going to use my own experiences to tailor a plan for myself for September. For accountability, here are my main goals:  1. Have three solid, filling meals a day, with small snacks as needed. Essentially, replicate my college meal plan experience.  Breakfast was usually around 8:15, and was a latte and bagel/cream cheese. The latte was sipped over the course of a couple of hours. (Looking back, I never even thought about the calories in the bagel/latte combo—I just ate it. God I miss when I wasn’t so fixated on food.)Lunch would usually be about four hours later, around 12:30. I would try and grab a variety of stuff (ah, how I took the variety of prepared food for granted). Usually some greens/coleslaw, plus some tofu or chik’n nuggets and some other vegetable side. So I guess it ended up being protein and veggies, with a cookie or two for dessert.Dinner would be similar to lunch, but more substantial, and usually around 5-6pm. More protein, more veggies, but also more carbs like bread and butter, rice, or sometimes pasta. Sometimes I’d add a side salad too. I’d usually still have some kind of dessert, either a slice of cake or cookie or a bowl of cereal. In between meals, I might have an apple that I took from the dining hall, or small snacks like goldfish or dry cereal. But for the most part, that was about it. Looking back, it looks like a lot of food, but a) I was more active then than I am now and b) I regularly eat way more than that in my binges, but I binge on snack food so it doesn’t seem like the same amount of food. That’s the most ridiculous part: I could be eating comparative or fewer calories now as I used to, but the food could be so much better, and yet my stupid animal brain wants to continually get high off of snacks upon snacks upon snacks. 2. Be more active. In college, I usually got up to at least 8000 to 9000 steps a day, and some days way exceeded that. So now, I want to make more of an effort to go out and move. I would sometimes go to the gym in college (not possible now, thanks corona), but for the most part, it was just walking anyways.I’d like to get into the habit of occasional morning walks. Evening walks are nice too, but there’s more people out and in NYC that makes me anxious. For now, I only go to work once a week, so there’s only one day a week where I consistently get to 8000-9000 steps. I can usually convince myself to leave my apartment on weekends, so I try and get extra steps then, but I’m still lagging far behind where I was. So, I need to find a way to get walking into my routine. 3. Stop bingeing. Stop bingeing for real. I cannot live like this. Food cannot keep occupying my every thought. It’s taking up so much of my energy that it’s hard to find other things to enjoy and focus on. I cannot keep bingeing. It is not sustainable; it is bad for me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I read through The Fuck It Diet and Brain Over Binge recently. I think both ultimately boil down to getting rid of food restriction and eating adequately and allowing yourself to feel uncomfortable emotions. I plan to reread Brain Over Binge because I’m too concerned about the weight gain that The Fuck It Diet seems to promise (horrible, I know, but maybe one day I’ll get over it). Brain Over Binge resonated with me, too, and I think it will be better to focus on the steps that Hanson outlines.  4. Find new ways to spend time that are not revolved around food, weight, dieting, etc. College was busy to say the least. I’m trying to branch out and find new things to enjoy. It’s hard when bingeing leads to depressive episodes which suck the fun and the light out of everything, but I’m trying. Lately, I’ve been rewatching lots of my favorite TV shows, I’ve started writing fanfiction (somewhat embarrassing, but it’s enjoyable enough), I’ve gotten into commentary youtube channels, and I’m trying to read more. Some other things I can incorporate into my every day life: applying for jobs, studying for the GRE and LSAT, journaling, writing letters to friends, taking online courses, studying languages, listening to new music, blogging more regularly, drawing, keeping in contact more with friends and family, etc. The limit does not exist.  So I guess that’s about everything. The thing is, I still desperately want to lose weight—I can’t keep spending money on insane amounts of food, I can’t keep buying clothes in bigger and bigger sizes, and I will continue to self-destruct in worse and worse ways if I keep bingeing and my body keeps spreading.  BUT I know that weight loss cannot be one of my goals. I’ll hyperfixate on restricting too much, which will only backfire. I have a bluetooth scale, so maybe I’ll try syncing my weight with my phone daily, but I won’t check anything until the end of the month at the earliest.  So essentially, my only goals will be to eat adequately, resist the urges to binge, move my body in satisfying ways, and find ways to make life happier.  I wish myself luck, and good luck to everyone else out there on this path !",eating,"Question: You suffered with binge eating disorder? How did you get over it? Answer: toethefinishline:
Okay. So I am not exactly sure how I beat it- like there is not a simple solution or anything! And it takes time. You will gradually get better and relapse every once in awhile but hopefully you can get to the point i am at today! Binge free for over a year and a half!
To start I came to the realization that some days I would be eating 2000-3000 calories all of them processed, sugary, non nutritional, gross foods. And before I had the disorder I would restrict, eating no more than 100-200 calories per day if even that many. So this was a HUGE change for me! I went from 110 pounds to 158 over the 8 months! And from basically no calories per day to a few thousand! It was awful! And I was trying to look good for my vacation so I told myself every day that today is the last day I will binge- tomorrow I will fast! But each day I would try to fast and be consumed by thoughts of food and eating. And it continually got worse! I remember this one specific instance sitting in my last class for the day that had just started and I craved cheese cake. The class dragged on so slowly and I couldn’t concentrate because I just wanted to eat and when I came home I ate the rest of the cheese cake in my freezer and I felt so sick. And I thought “okay. the cheese cake is gone so the temptation is gone and starting now I will fast” but of course dinner came and I found something else to eat! Some nights I would have sugar cravings and I would go to the kitchen get the flour, sugar, vanilla, and water and make a disgusting cookie dough type of thing that was pure sugar and eat it just like that ! it was awful but I just could not control it!
I finally came to the realization that i didn’t have to fast or diet or restrict to lose weight. I mean I was eating over 2000 calories almost everyday so obviously if I just cut down to 1200 or 1500 (a healthy amount) i would still lose weight. From there I completely switched everything! All of my goals! I no longer wanted skinny. I wanted fit. I redid my tumblr, unfollowed any triggering/unhealthy blogs and joined the fitblrs(bet decision ever!) And I made some friends and found a weight loss buddy and we made healthy plans together! I made a new grocery list consisting of fruits, veggies, healthy dinners, and little treats. So i would still enjoy myself and not feel deprived. I began exercising again - since i rarely did while i had binge eating disorder. I managed the stress of school by not procrastinating as much and doing my work during lunch and free time in class so when I came home I didn’t have so much to do. And I made new goals for myself. I wanted to become a runner, stop binging, eat healthy by choice, become a weight lifter, to be fit, to have abs, and have better endurance. They are all still my goals and I have only completed a few. this all takes time but the good thing is that my binging has ended.
I found that once I centered my goals and my life on health- I stopped focusing on the scale and on calorie counting it helped! The numbers do NOT matter! The number I was concerned with was how many days I went binge free! And don’t start by aiming to never binge again! Start small. Go for 2 days, then 4, then 8 - whatever you want! just aim to go longer than you did before!
Why I stopped focusing on the scale and calorie counting: The number on the scale does not matter at all ! End of story. It doesn’t measure your self worth or your beauty. It is just a number. There is nothing to it. You need to focus on how you feel and what you eat. I NEVER calorie count anymore because the numbers got way too obsessive for me! I would try to have low sodium, low fat, low carbs, low sugars, but enough calories. and it was impossible! And the days I saw that I had too many of one of those I would be like “fuck it! i have already ruined my day so i will just eat whatever i want” then i would binge! And the days i didn’t eat enough I would try to make dinner larger and then it would be huge and awful and it would make me binge then too! So I stopped counting calories!
I just made a healthy meal plan of foods that I should try to eat more often: oatmeal, fruits, veggies, green smoothies, luna bars, greek yogurt, eggs, etc. And I started to make a meal plan. Once I got into the habit of the meal plan it would get easier. Some treats I enjoy are soy ice cream and pita chips- I usually have one treat a day and i don’t even portion it typically. I eat what I want and put it away. I figure it is better than what i was doing before and I need to enjoy myself. If you set too many restrictions on yourself you will binge! I tried going vegan but I realized how restrictive that is and it made it really hard so I stopped because I knew I wasn’t ready for it and I honestly don’t think I am ready even now after so long. I do NOT diet because I know that I will binge. This is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE. You need to be healthy for you and only for you. So you will feel better and be healthier, as a result you will look better too! But you cannot be doing this for the looks! And you need to realize this won’t happen overnight! You must be patient and be proud of yourself ! It is such a wonderful feeling going days without binging and you will be so proud and the exercise will make you feel great and eating right will too!
So for main points:
Do NOT count calories.
Do NOT diet/restrict at all!
Do NOT weight yourself.
Find a weight loss buddy.
Drink lots of water!
Treat yourself everyday to something you love!
Set new and healthy goals for yourself!
Focus on being fit and healthy - not skinny.
Fill your tumblr with healthy motivation!
You can even open up to your family and get their help for this! I am sure it would’ve helped if I had told mine but I couldn’t and they still don’t know! But they will be able to support you with healthy eating and maybe even find a nutritionist you can talk to!
Also clear out all tempting foods that cause you to binge! I no longer have cheese cake at my house nor do I buy fiber one mocha bars (because my mom would buy them and i would eat one then always eat the whole box. I still don’t trust myself with them so I just leave them at the store! Someone else can enjoy them!).
I hope this answer helps! I am not sure if it will - let me know if there is anything I didn’t answer or any other way I can help ! I am sorry I kind of rambled but I was trying to cover everything and as I said this is a really hard question to answer!",body,"1. Im not a professional. An eating disorder specialist will always know more than me and know whats best. A dietician and a nutritionist will always know more than me and know whats best. 2. Im just a person on the internet. GIANT REPLY TIME:With that out of the way, i will just share what comes to my mind. Rules will not prevent an eating disorder. Eating disorders thrive on rules. There is also no automatic switch to eating normal and the body healing. The body needs time to heal at its own pace and that means we gotta continue the normal eating even when we dont like it, even if we gain some weight, the body needs its time as well as the mind. When the mind heals, the body will follow. We just gotta deal with the bs until then.Eating every few hours isnt bad. That doesnt mean you have to eat a meal every few hours, you could literally have a piece of fruit or some pretzels in between meals. Sometimes i get extra hungry and eat like 5 meals a day. Who cares.  Just munching isnt bad. Some days i have 3 full meals. Some days i sleep in and just graze on snacks all day long. Like who cares. My body will handle it. Yes some medications have an effect on appetite. You can always talk with your medical team about it and see what they suggest. Sometimes i cant tell if im hungry and some times i cant tell if im full. Thats just how it be. Finding a routine can be helpful. Breakfast, snacky, lunch, snacky, dinner. Maybe another snack at night if you feel like it because why not. Eating with other people can be helpful, i tend to go werewolf when i eat alone. With pals i feel more relaxed and less likely to tie my mental and emotional state with my eating. Bro(and/or sis) never be afraid to speak up about these issues. Ask questions. Talk about concerns. To your family, your friends, your doctors, people who can be there with you in person to help. Literally no reason to face this alone. At all. Maybe consider writing your thoughts and feelings in a journal and tracking whats going on in your life and in your head when you have bad food days. Thats a good first step. You can use that as a guide to talk to a professional about whats happening. Or just to talk to a trusted family member (someone old enough to actually help you)If you feel a need to use behaviors i want to skip meals i want to binge eat etc, ask yourself .. Why?Work on fixing the why and then you wont have the need to use behaviors. The sooner you work on yourself the better. Take care!!!! Good luck! Reach out to others!!! Hit me up if you ever need. Edit: i thought of this after hitting send. You can try those plates that have the dividers in them to help with eyeballing portion sizes.",weight,"Local pissed off bitch rants again:Im going to start this by saying i am a binge eater. Ive been binging for years. Its like the coalescence of my entire ed, my bulimia. I dont fix binge eating by counting calories. I dont get out of a binge cycle by counting calories. Binge eating isnt about calories, its not about WHAT i eat its HOW i eat it. I can binge eat on fucking ice cubes. I need to address the mental and emotional problems that cause me to binge, not eat at so and so healthy amount or else. Eating a meal that is high in calories isnt the same as devouring food uncontrollably as i attempt to fill the void. I have to learn to eat comfortably no matter the calories in it. Dont bring calories into this. Thats just asking for failure. Fix the mind first, the body will follow after. Fix the mind first i wont have the desire to binge eat. Without the desire to binge eat my body can heal. The only reason calories are counted is for the desire to lose weight and undo the binging. That wont fix anything. Thats not recovery. Thats attempting to keep control over food. That mentality is still disordered whether i like it or not. Bro. Get real. Fixing my body before fixing my mind is the biggest waste of time and energy. Whats the point. Literally. What is the actual point.Im not excused from the laws of nature and the science of the mind. No one is. Logic before Ed. Im not special. My brain works like a brain and im not an exclusion to logic or even self awareness for that matter",binge,"lately, i’ve been eating out more, getting takeout more, eating processed food more, mindlessly eating more, emotionally eating more, and simply ingesting more for a variety of reasons (convenience, different levels of hunger, coping, adjusting to a new schedule, social reasons, different priorities, etc.)...and I’M A-OKAY WITH IT.

when i finally committed to eating disorder recovery, food freedom, and an intuitive eating lifestyle, i didn’t commit to eating “perfectly” because perfect eating doesn’t exist! while i feel pretty in tune and comfortable with my body and it’s wants/needs, my goal has never been to NEVER emotionally eat, mindlessly eat, overeat, or even binge eat ever again. instead, my goal is to ALWAYS show myself so much self-compassion and grace that no matter what, when, how, or how much i eat, it wouldn’t affect the way i treated myself or viewed my worth.

do i try to honor my body through living a healthy lifestyle? yes. do i scrutinize over the decisions i make? no. it’s simply just not worth it for me and would most likely be less healthy than whatever the decisions were.

i love eating out. i love eating in. they both bring joy in different ways, and neither is “better” than the other.  it feels good to feel so comfortable with my body no matter what food decisions i make, and if you need the reminder: choosing freedom is always worth it!

- my hunger levels are definitely lower, and i’ve now been eating ~3500-4000 calories a day. i have fluctuations, but the consistent weight gain seems to have stopped, which means i’m reaching or around my set point
- MOST days are good or neutral body image days, and i think i’ve gotten pretty good at having ~body neutrality~. i still have bad body image days sometimes, but i’ve realized that bad body image is usually a response to other stuff in my life going on and isn’t really a response to how my body actually looks even when it feels like it, so i’m able to dismiss the negative thoughts pretty quickly
- i have been averaging one structured workout a week for pretty much this entire weight gain journey so far because of other things. this has probably been the hardest on me mentally because it took me years to build the amount muscle and strength i had. i'm proud of how far i've come with my relationship with exercise though and know that it’s okay for body comp to change in different stages of life
- i didn't realize until this morning how big of a win it was for me that i haven't had a binge eating episode (if you didn't know, i struggled with binge eating disorder for 4 years), since i started this all in journey
——
i share where i'm at right now, not so you can compare your journey to mine, but so that if you're on a similar journey as i am or have been, you can maybe feel less alone or have hope. this is my second weight gain journey since choosing recovery and isn't a response to healing disordered eating (i’ve been fully recovered for ~6 months now), so this process has looked wayyy different than when i gained weight immediately post-restriction.  i say this because i know some of you are gaining weight, and i don't want you to misinterpret that committing to eating in excess and weight gain while healing from disordered eating is easy because it isn't. it was the hardest thing i've probably ever done. but, it is WORTH IT, you CAN do it, and eventually you WILL get to a place where food doesn't consume your mind, numbers don’t affect how you view yourself, and you are TOTALLY free",health,"when i first started my food freedom journey, i honestly didn’t think i’d ever actually desire eating vegetables because for a long time into my food freedom journey, vegetables just didn’t sound appetizing.

backstory: i restricted my food intake for years, and for a lot of those years, i also struggled with binge eating disorder that was perpetuated by restriction (physical and mental) and feelings of guilt and shame.  restriction for me didn’t mean that i didn’t eat, but rather, i saw the foods i ate in numbers, and vegetables were something i was constantly eating in very large quantities because they simply meant i got to eat more volume. 

when i finally decided to listen to and honor my hunger and cravings, it felt like the only foods i wanted to eat were the foods i would binge on - aka all the things i viewed as “bad” and would restrict - and i was always eating them in what seemed like extremely excessive amounts.

i remember thinking i was becoming an unhealthy person by honoring my hunger and cravings, but i can look back and confidently say that doing so and releasing all expectations of what intuitive eating “should” look like was the healthiest thing i ever did for myself.

it took time and patience, but now that my body trusts me to honor it, vegetables are a food i actually ENJOY eating, and gentle nutrition is something i’m able to incorporate with no feelings of morality attached.

  TW: VENT, body image  
 the “low bodyfat percentage = health” sentence i mentioned some time ago, i for the love of anything can not get it out of my head. i KNOW that it isn’t true, yet the whole conversation keeps playing in the back of my head.  “but a low bodyfat percentage is good, it indicates health!” “no, it does not, more fat does not equal less fit or unhealthier, i-” “so you are saying morbid obesity is healthy or what? so many people are living unhealthy lives and [i’m gonna spare you the rest]” - “THERE IS SOMETHING BETWEEN BEING SKIN AND BONE AND BEING MORBIDLY OBESE, also each body feels comfortable at a different fat percentage and size, i for example am quite toned and muscular, but i’m ALWAYS GONNA RETAIN A BIT MORE OF FAT AS WELL, ESPECIALLY AROUND MY BELLY, AND THAT IS OKAY” “oh don’t worry, keep working out like this and your abs are gonna pop even more, you won’t have any fat left to worry about” “YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND, this is NOT THE POINT, i don’t need a fucking sixpack! i am trying to be healthy and fit, to achieve having a sixpack i’d have to hurt my body and there is no reason to do that, having some fat is FINE and NORMAL and it is OKAY, that i’m still struggling to accept it sometimes does NOT mean i have to get rid of it, it simply means i have to keep working on my MINDSET and so yould you” “but you eat so clean and healthy i am sure-” “can we please stop talking about this now, bye” *that’s where i hung up"" — you see, he completely internalized all that bullshit. he doesn’t understand how much he’s hurting me with such comments. my purpose is not to be as skinny as i can be! to be skinny is not to be fucking healthy! i am strong and well-trained, but not because i want to look good, mostly because rock climbing is my passion. and honestly? i am NOT eating “well” because i want to be “thin”. i eat fruits and veggies to get all the vitamins my body needs. lots of nuts and seeds for protein and healthy fats. carbs from bread or oatmeal to give me energy. AND ALSO CHOCOLATE AND CAKE AND CHEESE BECAUSE I FUCKING ENJOY IT AND THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE ENERGY!!!  sure, i have to make sure that i get enough protein etc. from my mostly plant-based diet, but i’m doing all that FOR MY BODY. not to defeat it and make it look “good”.  i am still having good and very bad days concerning my body image, it would help a lot if people like him would properly inform themselves before talking shit and commenting on my body. telling me i look “toned” and “fit” and as a result “good” may be well-intentioned, but what if i wasn’t? what if i didn’t enjoy rock climbing as much, what if i stopped working out due to whatever reason? my purpose is not to be beautiful, and my body deserves to be respected in any shape it may end up being in! every body deserves respect, health is more important than looks!  sometimes i am thinking about ending this friendship, it brings so much toxicity. on the other hand, i know he is not doing it on purpose. he doesn’t understand it. he simply says what society made him believe to be true … and he is not the only one. i am SO DONE WITH THIS DIET CULTURE BULLSHIT i swear i’m gonna fight it to death",ed,"“what do you want to cook for dinner?”- i ask.

“pizza.” - he responds.

i pick up some pre-made garlic and herb pizza dough, a jar of pizza sauce, and a ball of mozzarella cheese at the grocery store, not some alternative crust or low-fat cheese, and we assemble the ingredients, cook our pizza, and enjoy it fully.

food is fuel. food is joy. food is comfort. food is nourishment. food is culture. food is energy. food is connection. food is love.

food is so many things, and especially with all the messaging about food, nutrition, beauty, health, and our bodies, that can make food choices feel really complicated no matter what your relationship with food is.

but, food is also just food.

it’s okay if you eat past fullness sometimes. it’s okay if you ate something that made you gassy and bloated. it’s okay if what you just ate didn’t satisfy you. it’s okay if your eating isn’t your idea of “perfect”.

i know that shifting self-talk away from simple binary terms like “good”/“bad” and “right”/“wrong” is easier talked about than actually doing, but next time you catch yourself feeling guilty about your eating,

rather than asking yourself “what can i change about my eating to feel better?”,

i prompt you to ask yourself “what messages can i remind myself of?” and “how can i show myself compassion to feel better?” instead.

food is just food, it doesn’t have to have any power over you, and there are SO many more important things in life to focus on and experience."

7,7,breakfast,"Food in the desert 🐪🌴🇲🇦 All our meals were prepared for us for the five days while we were on our trek in the Sahara. Surprisingly I found that to be very stress-free. We ate all our meals sat outside on cushions round a central “floor cloth”. Breakfast was a selection of cereals, bread, spreads (including biscoff and Nutella!) and our chef Hassan made porridge for us every day. There was Moroccan tea, coffee, hot chocolate and fruit juice to drink. I had porridge every day with chocolate spread stirred in, and topped with granola. It was so good I usually had two bowls. Great fuel for a morning of walking. Lunch was always bread plus another carb (rice, couscous, pasta, noodles, potatoes), along with a cooked vegetable dish (courgettes, carrots, peppers) and a protein (omelette, beef, mackerel, tinned sardines, lentils) plus slices of cheese and a platter of chopped salad (tomatoes, cucumber, sweetcorn, onion). After lunch we had little glasses of mint tea which I tried to like, but didn’t really. When we arrived in camp after our afternoon trekking, we were greeted with coffee or mint tea and piles of biscuits. Two afternoons Hassan made us these delicious deep-fried bread things, which with a sprinkling of sugar and a bit of jam or spread put in the middle, tasted very much like doughnuts. I managed to eat one both days, I did mentally struggle a bit over it but I didn’t want to miss out. Dinner was three courses starting with bread and soup. The first couple of nights it was harira soup, which we all loved. After that it was a kind of potato soup which we weren’t so keen on. Then the main course was several platters similar to lunch, and dessert was tinned fruit.  It was all (apart from the weird potato soup) really delicious and so impressive considering all the food and cooking equipment had to be carried out into the desert with us. I made sure I ate protein and LOADS of veggies at lunch and dinner, and I always had some bread but I did tend to avoid the other carbs. Not going to lie, knowing I was walking for several hours each day made it feel easier to eat adequately, but mostly eating wasn’t stressful. I didn’t obsess or worry about it outside of meal times and it was very freeing not having to plan, choose, buy or prepare anything 👍",morning,"houston food roundup!!

currently still recovering from my weekend trip, but houston  has a lot of incredible food to offer, and i wanted to share the spots i visited!

swipe for this weekend’s highlight reel/photo dump and an important monday reminder —>

@mad.houston
a really vibrant and exciting atmosphere with delicious cocktails and a unique take on spanish cuisine. the highlights of our meal were the gin cocktails, the grilled octopus, and the pictured huevos rancheros dessert (passion fruit mousse, mascarpone cream, and white chocolate aerated rocks).

@wearevibrant
a casual restaurant with a modern, open, and airy interior. they serve an all day menu with a lot of great options for anyone with dietary restrictions. one of the best matcha lattes i’ve had.

@milkandsugarcreamery
a handcrafted ice cream shop with unique flavors and specializing in fun house-made mix-ins. i got the thai tea and rain or shine (earl grey, lemon, + lavender) flavors, and they were both really tasty.

@uchihouston
some of the best sushi i’ve ever had. an amazing experience with great service, nicely timed courses, and innovative flavorful preparations of melt-in-your-mouth sushi. every bite was incredible!

@tinysmilkandcookies
a cute walk-up dessert shop connected to a full-service restaurant. their chocolate chip cookies were the star of the show and are super flavorful, soft, and chewy.

@torchystacos
a local chain serving a variety of tacos. the queso was super tasty, and the tacos were really good too.

@localfoodstexas
i really liked this place and could see myself going often if i lived nearby. a no-fuss cafeteria style restaurant offering a ton of fresh, flavorful, and interesting sandwiches and salads.

@sweetcupgelato
a fun gelato and sorbet shop with a great variety of rotating flavors including classics such as pistachio and dark chocolate along with unique flavors such as black sesame and lavender & guajillo-honey tres leches.

big thank you to @ev.degroot for showing me around your city! so grateful college brought us together, and there was no one else i’d rather explore houston with ❤️",lunch,"some philly good eats—

@pizzeriavetri really good classic neapolitan style pizza. there’s traditional flavors like margherita and pepperoni, but also some really unique flavors like the seasonal roasted lamb pizza. trust me, and order the spinach pizza here- onions, roasted garlic, mozzarella, ricotta fonduta, parmesan, and chili flakes on light yet chewy dough *chef’s kiss*

@cheufishtown_nunu asian fusion ramen bar with a menu of asian inspired noodle bowls, soups, and small plates, sushi, and japanese-style pub food. great food and atmosphere. the scallion rangoons appetizer here is a must order!

@doubleknot_phl one of my all time favorite restaurants in philly that i find myself always wanting to go back to. really tasty sushi, pan-asian cuisine, and robotayaki enjoyed in an intimate underground izakaya atmosphere. a great spot for any occasion.

@charlie_was vegan restaurant serving creative plant-based small plates and excellent cocktails. my favorites were their espresso martini, ricotta, and silken tofu & mushroom ramen.

@grancaffelaquila i haven’t gotten the chance to have a full dining experience here yet (although i’ve heard great things!), but i go just for their gelato, and it is phenomenal. my go-to flavor combo is pistachio + fondente, but i like to mix it up too, and you really can’t go wrong with any of the flavors here.",night,"some people are really still out here thinking vegan food isn't as yummy as animal-containing food🥴🥴 Admittedly I haven't explored enough of vegan LA even though I'm only an hour out. but we can always use some good restaurant recs. So I'm gonna try to give some unbiased super open reviews of my experiences to give you all some perspective

This burger at @eatdrinkvegan was from the @sluttyveganatl truck! Okay so not quite LA but still an option if you want a burger but wanna try eating a veggie one that doesn't taste like brown rice and black beans and are in the Atlanta area. They use @impossible_foods burgers and.. Hawaiian bread buns... YALL. HAWAIIAN BUNS. It's not a new concept to me but the last time I had a Hawaiian bun burger absolutely nothing about it was vegan 😂😂 so this bun was nice and spongy but a slight sweet that contrasts with the bun + cheese really well. honestly idk what kind of cheese they used but it melted with the sauce JUST like an in n out burger did. As a native Californian, im allowed to say I know my in n out. &then there was the caramelized onions and the jalapenos that rounded it all out. what I liked most is that the bites I took didn’t feel as heavy as other vegan burgers i’ve tried. 
To be honest I took a few bites and really enjoyed them. I was already kinda full from the pizza and noodles and ice cream and bao bun we ate in like while waiting to buy this burger at EDV so I just wanted to taste the burger more than eat it all haha. Would I pay $13 dollars for it? probably just the first time to experience it. I'm not a HUGE burger person (I'm all about that pad Thai baby) so the price isn't a big deal for me as a one time experience. It's a bit pricey for a burger lover who could just go spend $4 on a double double (idk how much they are anymore) though. but to spend $15 on it again would be hard to justify if i already tasted it IMO. Definitely recommend any burger lover to try it regardless!

should I do ratings? how should I rate my food? hahahah help I’m new",dinner,"Question: Heyy, What do you usually have for lunch or between breakfast and dinner? Sorry if this is annoying I just am kind of lost and never know what to eat..I hate meal prepping but I’m kind of forced to and I never know what to pack for lunch Answer: so i dont really eat 3 meals a day i kinda just.. eat food when im hungry but if im goin out for the day and or night i always pack at least a meal and some snacks. ya girl carries a HUGE backpack for this reason. i love the kind cherry-chocolate-cashew bars, always keep one on me. i love pressed fruit strips too. both stay relatively stable in a bag. if i have access to a fridge during the day ill bring myself a frozen meal that can be microwaved, if i wont have access to a fridge ill bring a room temp stable microwave meal, or a sandwich. my favs r pb&j (js marantha peanut butter with no sugar or salt added is the TITS and only $5 a jar), banana sandwichs (toast bread, one side pb, one side vegan mayo, banana slices in between) MMM OMG theyre the best i swear, or i like to make a sanwich with tofurky smoked deli slices and chao creamy cheez slices, with dijon mustard and vegan mayo. the tofurky sammies r good on sub buns or toasted bread. i like my pb&j’s toasted too. some other good things to keep in ur bag are like fruit cups, i love mandarin oranges and peaches n pears in syrup. gogosqueeze applesauce packets are good in bags also and come in a variety of flavors. u can keep pringles in ur bag bc the tube helps them not smush!!. or ill put cut fruit in a tupperware and bring that if i have access to a fridge. grapes are good to bring and dont need a fridge. i hated meal prepping too but it makes my life SO much easier and honestly i love being prepared now. wont catch me without snacks ever im like the mama bear i always have sustenance on me. i used to go rly hard and cook full ass meals all week long and put it in tupperwares but buying frozen meals honestly saves me a ton of time and money and sanity. no shame in eating an amys bowl",cream,"haven’t been cooking much in the kitchen lately since i’ve been home w/ family, and we are all about family meals together. but, here’s a picture of the pasta i brought to work a couple days ago!
——
i’ve got a fun and busy day ahead of me! just took advantage of stale cinnamon raisin bagels and cooked my fam some bagel french toast, am headed to a quick workout, am spending quality time with family over a lunch out, and have an event i am going to with my best friend tonight!  my weekends are usually spent not doing much besides laying in bed reading internet articles and watching cooking videos, so i’m looking forward to this switch up in my typical weekend routine. happy saturday!!

pasta deats —> cavatappi pasta (my favorite pasta shape) w/ homemade tomato basil’s sauce, fresh zucchini, onion, + cherry tomatoes all from @heinens aka my favorite grocery store ever!",coffee,"Today I woke up from a nap at 5pm and thought oh! I haven’t eaten lunch! But actually when I thought about it, I may have eaten lunch, just not my usual lunch. I’ve no idea what meals I’ve eaten today to be honest. I ate a hot cross bun with spread at about 10am which I think was breakfast. Then a couple of hours later I had two pieces of toast with spread and marmite, because I was going on a run and needed some carbs. When I got back from my run, I ate a piece of cake that a friend had kindly baked for us, with some clotted cream. I classed this as refuelling after my run. For tea we had a Moroccan chicken casserole with veg and couscous (also brought round by the same friend) followed by another slice of cake and ice cream. And later this evening I had another slice of cake. I usually have eggs for breakfast and a sort of veggie/kale/protein bowl for lunch, but I guess just because I don’t eat either of my “usual” meals doesn’t mean other stuff doesn’t count as meals. I wouldn’t choose to eat like I did today every day, but I think my intake overall energy-wise was actually ok. I’m anxious to keep my intake up and not skip meals through lack of time, because I’ve got a point to prove to T.",topped,"Some savory action going on this AM for bfast aka the best meal of the day before heading downtown to take a class at @calliespilates. Pancakes are probably my favorite breakfast food of all time, so craving a savory breakfast doesn’t mean giving up pancakes 🥞 I used @kodiakcakes protein packed buttermilk pancake mix and subbed @wearerebol bone broth for water as well as added some red pepper flakes to the batter 💯 on the side I did a big bed of spinach with 2 over easy eggs 🍳 + a hefty spoonful of guac 🥑 topped with red pepper flakes + black pepper",meal,"time for another philly food round up…

@surayaphilly an all day specialty market, garden, and restaurant that will definitely not disappoint. the beautiful atmosphere with incredibly flavorful and tasty lebanese food and cocktails is perfect for a special occasion meal. for the full experience, i definitely recommend doing “a taste of suraya” at dinner which will let you try a full spread of dips and a lot of variety.

@dottiesdonuts perfectly chewy, yeasty, and not too sweet vegan donuts that were worth going out of the way for! flavors here are unique and creative, and they are constantly changing, so i will definitely be back.

@kfar_cafe an israeli bakery and cafe right rittenhouse square. all the food was delicious, but the pastries were the star of the show. get the pistachio sticky bun or chocolate babka. trust me. highly recommend as a relaxed breakfast/brunch spot.

@branzinophilly an italian byob restaurant with tasty house-made pastas and food and an elegant outdoor seating area which is perfect for these warmer months coming up.

@weckerlys may be my favorite ice cream shop in philly! they focus on using local ingredients to create high quality small batch ice cream and ice cream sandwiches. they have both classic and changing specialty flavors, and every flavor i’ve tried here has been delicious.",favorite,"catch me swimming in here alllll morning 🏊‍♀️☕️😴. not really though because i limit myself to a max of 2 coffee drinks a day reserved only for days that reaaaally call for it 😅. honestly, i was never really a big coffee person up until the past few months, but if you watch my stories, you know that coffee is now something that i love drinking almost daily, having fun with, and enjoy sharing with you all.

i know for a lot of people, coffee gives them jitters or heightens their anxiety, but for me, getting up bright and early to get coffee from a local coffee shop or taking the time to make a fancy coffee drink at home is one of the only consistent parts of my morning routine and is something that brings me a lot of peace and joy. when i know i have a busy or overwhelming day ahead, i can at least take 10 minutes to do something for me, and lately, that’s been making my coffee and appreciating every sip of it.

happy wednesday, friends 🤍 i hope you do one thing that makes you happy today! 

& remember,

if it brings you joy, it doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else.

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott’s book ‘vegan one pot wonders’)

-1 cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for 2 hours
-1 onion, diced
-1 clove of garlic, minced
-1 cup each of diced carrots and celery
-1 bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
-2 cups water
-2 cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about 35 minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don’t stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

super green lentil soup (altered from @jessica_prescott_ book ‘vegan one pot wonders’)

-1 cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for 2 hours
-1 onion, diced
-1 clove of garlic, minced
-1 cup each of diced carrots and celery
-1 bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
-2 cups water
-2 cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about 35 minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don’t stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
immunity stew: * diced onion
* diced celery
* diced rainbow swiss chard stalk and chopped up leaves
*1 bunch purple kale
*1 bunch dandelion greens * halved brussel sprouts
* 4 cups vegetable stock
* 2 tablespoons chickpea miso
* 1 can white beans * sea salt

* garlic powder 
sauté onion and celery in oil, sea salt, and miso until soft and fragrant. add in swiss chard leaves and cook down until wilted. add in remaining veggies and beans and cover with vegetable broth. add more seasonings and then heat to medium high and cover partially. cook for about 35-40 minutes with occasional stirring! .

i’m not the BEST at meal prep, but no matter what i always make sure to have a few batches of roasted veggies on hand for the week. i’m sharing my favorite tips and uses for them below!
.
* steam before you roast! i find steaming hard veggies like broccoli, cauliflower florets and butternut squash before roasting helps them roast and get soft to the bite without burning. for a quick steam i just place chopped veggies in a microwave safe bowl, fill with enough water to cover the bottom, and throw a paper towel on top. pop in the microwave for about 3-4 minutes and then drain and let cool before roasting
* be generous with fats! i use a lotttt of oil to roast as well as a variety of seasonings. coat veggies with oil and mix around with your hands to ensure they’re evenly coated (front and back)!
* make sure your oven is completely heated before putting the veggies in. if you put them in as the temperature is changing they won’t cook evenly .
.
what i use roasted veggies for:
* curries and stews! i always use roasted veggies as opposed to raw ones because they’re much more flavorful. for example, when i make cauliflower curry i roasted the florets and then toss them in the pot after.
* loaded veggie bowls. i find serving veggies cold leaves them tasting much sweeter! once they’re roasted and stored a veggie bowl takes minutes to throw together. * dips. i love blending up roasted eggplant or roasted red peppers for different spreads. again, such a flavor enhancer!

hope this was helpful friends!

9,9,cup,"years ago i used to force myself to work out “fasted”, terrified to eat anything before the gym in case i “didn’t burn it all off” (i’m cringing just typing that). i would spend these sessions light headed, nauseous, and itching to finish. absolutely miserable. eventually i graduated to 1 rice cake with peanut butter powder and water before a workout, woo! safe to say this wasn’t much better. years later i can finally recognize the importance of good mood food, aka nutrient dense powerhouses like nuts and seeds. now i *always* eat before movement. these GOOD MOOD FOOD ENERGY BITES are the perfect balance of sweet and salty with an energizing, nourishing punch. recipe below!
▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
good mood food energy bites: - 1/4 cup raw cashews
- 1/4 cup raw walnuts
- 2 tbsp ground flax
- 1/4 cup @eatnuttzo creamy peanut butter
- 2 tbsp melted coconut oil
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 2 tsp maca powder
- sea salt
- vanilla

add all ingredients to a food processor and blend until thick, sticky batter forms. roll into balls and place on a sheet of parchment paper. roll in extra toppings of choice (i used diced almonds and cacao nibs)

10,10,guys,"AD London Marathon TRAINING RECAP 🇬🇧🏅💪🏻
-
Because we all love a good camera roll dump, here are some photos I took throughout my training 🏃🏻‍♀️ Even though I didn’t manage to get to the @newbalance x @sportsshoes tent at the end of the race . . . because we ended up in the paramedic tent at the end feeling very spaced out and confused (😰), working on this campaign alongside my training has been so much fun 🤩 The kit was epic and whilst running can be a lonely sport, I managed to make some great friends as part of it - shoutout Chloe and Paula 😉
- 
Even though I found out I was running the marathon in April of this year, I only officially started training roughly three months ago because I had some foot issues, classic Holly 🙄😅 I did also start out with a running coach, however this didn’t continue throughout. I ran four times a week consistently for the majority of my training, with each of my sessions being varied, and my long runs were always part of my Sunday routine. The longest distance I tackled before the race was 35km and I started using my energy gels when I was running for longer than 90 minutes 💦
-
Coming down with an achilles injury with only a week to go really did get me down, however now that I’ve crossed the finish line I can definitely say that my training really did pay off! I ran so much faster than I expected and I don’t think I would have been able to do it without the crowds. I knew they would be good, but not *that* good, and wow, people literally screaming your name is *the* best form of motivation ever ok, period 🙌🏻
-
I answered a tonne of questions that you guys sent in on my story the other day in today’s video, so head over to YouTube to give it a watch! I have a lot of resting still to do and whilst my injury is healing I’ll be exploring other forms of movement for now, but running will always have a special place in my heart 🥰 I’m super excited for more challenges in the future 😏

 #nofunstandingstill #vmlm2021",holly,"✨Curly Girl Method✨ UPDATES!!!
-
Now when I say my hair has been on a journey, wowwww you guys it seriously has!!! For the majority of my life I’ve scraped my hair back into a tight bun on the top of my head: the classic Holly bun 😏 Don’t get me wrong, she reappears from time to time, but I’ve been following the Curly Girl Method pretty religiously for just over half a year now and it has transformed the health of my hair, literally 🙌🏻
-
So here’s what I do currently and some of my best advice:
-
🌼 Brushing my hair dry is a massive no no!!! I only use a wide toothed comb in the shower and sometimes a @denmanbrush just before I add gel. I’m also not applying any heat to my hair at all, so no straightening or use of a hair dryer!
-
🌼 In Thailand I was using the new Curly Girl approved shampoo and conditioner bars from @ethiqueworld. Ngl I’m still getting used to the bars, but I will be using them permanently going forwards because they are pretty much zero waste and therefore a lot better than buying haircare products in bottles! 🌎
-
🌼 As I’m swimming at the moment, I wash my hair more frequently than I’m used to doing 🙈 I wear a swimming cap (we love the look and ofc with the goggles too 😏) and so I always wash my hair after this or I just rinse it really well when I’m pushed for time lol. This tends to be two or three times a week.
-
🌼 Every time my hair gets wet after my shower I’ll style it with my gel from @sogooditsnoughty using the rake and scrunch method 👌🏻 I then plop for 1 hour using a big t-shirt and sleep with this t-shirt then covering my pillow to reduce frizz. On all other nights we’re wearing the silk bonnet 😉
-
Going forwards, I want to try some different styling gels . . . or maybe an oil if that also works? So if you have any recommendations then please do share down below 🥰 My new haircare routine is obviously a big step-up from what I did before with my hair (basically nothing 😅) and it takes a bit more time, but it’s part of my life now and I am honestly in love with my new found curls 💚
-
ps: getting em a polaroid for her birthday inspired me to take more pics using mine 😌 i have the @instaxhq Mini 11 😎

#curlygirlmethod",video,"Monday blues or Monday BLUES ...... Guys I am officially a Cambridge BLUE 😱 Ok so to many of you that means completely nothing, but it means quite a lot to me and the rest of the dance squad 💙 Essentially, students at Cambridge and Oxford can be awarded blues status for competing at the highest level in a particular sport. Now I’ve never really seen dance as a sport shall we say, however just because we ‘prance’ around in leotards and pink tights does NOT mean we don’t work our little booties off training, perfecting routines, stretching .... you know the drill. We might not be as macho as rugby players or have biceps like rowers, but that does not mean dancers should not qualify for blues.
•
So as I’ve alluded to above, many sports teams automatically get blues for their whole team. Every single member in many cases will get a blue. That includes rowing for example (standard 😑) but also the cheerleaders (who qualified last year) and what is called ‘dance sport’ in Cambridge (which I think is ballroom). HOWEVER our competition team STILL does not qualify for blues status. Ok we haven’t competed in five varsity matches yet, which is another requirement apparently (🙄) but what is most frustrating for us is that, how can cheerleading and ballroom get blues and we can’t? They are so similar!?!
•
I’m sorry for the rant, but I am still not done 😂 ..... Now you’re probably wondering, how did I get a blue, along with two other of my dance gals? Essentially, we had to apply for ‘extraordinary’ blues. We all had to fill in an application and then present them to the blues committee. Pretty intimidating. I wasn’t there, but I thank @myzteriouspeach and @bethhermi 🙌🏻
•
Next year the competition team should be able to apply for full blues status because we will have then competed in five varsity matches. However I don’t think it’s going to be easy getting blues for at least 40 people who are on the competition team 😅😢 We’ve got to try though, and keep making progress in getting dance officially recognised as a competitive ART FORM ✨ It is more than just a sport you know 😏👯‍♀️",solo,"*the final* DAY IN MY LIFE backpacking THAILAND 🇹🇭😭🍍

Rest assured, it’s just the final mini vlog from *this* travel series ok . . . I’ll be back with my rucksack on in no time 😉 This is your final piece to the puzzle, because across both YouTube and Instagram I’ve pretty much vlogged every single day for this month trip (except when we were both ill 😴)!!

Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I’d recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I’d organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map 😅)!
-
Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani 😱😳 Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive 😂 But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today’s vlog on YouTube (episode 13, live @ 5pm) 😏 I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it! I thought it would be more refreshing than it was, but it literally tasted like sweets to me in a liquid form lol 😆

7-Eleven is always pulling through with the best snacks and quick food when you need it, and our final stay in Bangkok was in the Siam district with @lubdbangkoksiam ✌🏻 Make sure you watch out for today’s vlog on YouTube, our final 24 hours in Thailand, and the moving home video coming out *tomorrow* with lots of family surprises 🤩

Before I arrived in Australia, this was one of my biggest worries on my itinerary. And that might sound surprising, but it was because the thought of going on an unguided 5-day road trip with people I’d only just met really made me feel quite anxious. And because the trip hadn’t been booked in advance, unlike the rest of my travels, I was just getting super stressed (Darryl, you’ll know 😅).
-
When I then arrived and completed my first tour with Welcome to Travel, of course the homesickness hit with full force and I did feel really overwhelmed. It has also taken time to settle down a bit too. Hence, I felt a lot more comfortable booking a guided tour. I did the 3-day trip with Wildlife Tours, which takes you all along the ‘greatest ocean road in the world’ (can confirm, the scenery and landscapes are amazing!) and then into the Grampians. It totally exceeded my expectations and I met some incredible people: definitely people I’d now call friends 🙌🏻
-
I am trying to make sure that I include all my first impressions, thoughts, feelings, worries and anxieties in my vlog series, because I think it’s really important to just show you that I am a real person. I struggle a lot in social situations, especially in novel contexts, and solo travelling in really pushing me out of my comfort zone. I am also doing a lot of things for the first time, which is craZy 😬 ... and a lot of them are honestly CRAZY things that I never, ever, thought I’d do 🙈

-
In all honesty, I don’t think any of us feel miraculously any ‘different’ BUT . . . a new year is always refreshing in one way or an other, and it’s a perfect opportunity to have a bit of a reset. Whilst I know many people shy away from setting goals or resolutions, which is totally fine, I personally like to set very open-ended ambitions. They’re still very meaningful don’t get me wrong, but it just means there’s no strict pressure on myself to ‘achieve’ any of them. I also can’t fail either hehe win win 🙃
-
I also remind myself that setting goals shouldn’t just be confined to a new year. Pick up a pen and plain paper (obviously 🙄😏), and you can write down what you want in your life on the 1st of January, 8th of May next year or 24th of October 5 years from now. The date doesn’t matter, it’s the thought and mindset that counts ✨

I wanted to share some of my goals with you all so that’s my latest video for today. It apparently includes taking cold showers and stepping outside my comfort zone with my style (😳), but it’s 2021 my friends, and Holly’s going to give it all she’s got 💥

The person I most want to be is confident, spontaneous, independent, looks after herself, puts her health first, lives in the moment, positively impacts others, makes friends with strangers, can handle awkwardness & doesn’t rely on others to do all the things that bring her joy. 

Who do you want to be? & where would you take yourself on a solo date??? Lmk below 🦋

These are some of the solo dates I’ve taken myself on: 
🛁 a bath, Netflix, a healthy drink & some snacks at home
☕️ solo coffee date (many of these)

☀️ sunrise with a book on the lakeside
📚 a day at the library 
🏃🏻‍♀️ a hike

-
This was a travel day for us heading North to Pai from Chiang Mai, so whilst we didn’t do much exploring, I still had amazing Thai food (not all shown), watched an incredible sunset and this journey along Route 1095 is pretty intense . . . it’s an 80km road with 762 bends 😅🙈 I didn’t feel amazing by the end of it, but I kept my mind occupied by listening to Climate of Change - an Audible original podcast with 6 episodes all about global climate issues 🌎🌿
-
You guys know I’m always absorbing new information by listening to different podcasts, and Audible is so so good because it has the world's largest selection of titles so there is always something for everyone!! Climate of Change, in particular, is available for you to listen now on Audible and I’ve found it to be a really inspiring and grounding series will lots of current information and opinions centred on tackling the climate crisis. I especially love podcasts that interview guests, and this one brings loads of stories to life, including those from Prince William himself 👌🏻
-
These travel days getting from A to B are definitely the less glamorous sides to backpacking, but it’s all part of the big adventure and one of the best things about travelling is that every day is *completely* different 🤩 Shoutout again to @audible_UK for working with me on this post, and definitely follow along for more of Holly in Thailand . . . with Matthew, of course, almost always sleeping 😂

🍔 I was quick to realise that the Aussie BBQ is for sure a BiG thing! I’ve never had so many in my life, and if you ever do a tour in Australia, a BBQ is guaranteed. @lordofthefries1 was also bomb!!!

💆🏻‍♀️ Now does anyone notice the subtle curls in my hair in this first photo? And that’s because I didn’t wash my hair for the last 2 months of my trip. You’re probably thinking “ew Holly” right now, but let me tell you, this did wonders for my hair (sadly probably all being reversed now).
-
🔥 The burn lines were not a vibe (when I forgot to lather myself in factor 70 sometimes oops)!
-
🌞 You know what also wasn’t a vibe? When you look pale as anything at the very end of your 3 month trip at surf camp! Like what even happened!!! I do blame the lighting though, no further comment . . .
-
💥 Still cannot believe I bungee jumped three times, one of which was backwards?????
-
🌴 I seriously don’t think I could bungee jump again (I can simulate the same feeling I had standing on the edge of the platform just by looking back at the photos!), but I’d fall from the sky any day. Despite looking high in these photos, it was EPiC!

🌚 The mysterious ‘holes-in-bag’ story from Fraser Island that’s never been solved (if you know, you know 😬).

Happy Real Me Monday, except it’s also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren’t enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don’t is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn’t brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can’t possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they’re someone’s very best photo, they’re the highlight of someone else’s life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it’s close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That’s why it’s so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

But your body isn’t a trend. Trends come & go. They change, DRASTICALLY, all the time. But your genetic makeup doesn’t.

In 22000 BC, women were considered beautiful for having “fertile” fuller bodies & for what their bodies could do… In 2022, women are losing their periods due to the pressure they feel to eat less & be smaller. 

It scares me to think that I could have an entire social media page full of photos like the ones on the left & use it to sell the idea of that particular body i.e. workout/meal plans, unrealistic body expectations, or endorse products that promise a certain outcome… When truthfully, a healthy & active lifestyle = the body on the right for me & it might look like something COMPLETELY different on anyone else.

Nobody really tells you that even when you’re working out & eating balanced meals, you’ll still have cellulite, get bloated, have belly fat & belly rolls, stretch marks, loose skin, and all the things that still wobble & squish. Nobody tells you that those things don’t need to be fixed because they’re all very normal human features (which they are!!) 🫶

For this reason 2 years ago, these “Real Me Monday” posts were born & my life started to change forever because I realised that body/beauty trends aren’t realistic, that confidence & true happiness comes from within & showing up as you are… instead of punishing your body, hiding yourself & changing the external parts of you. 

How do beauty trends make you feel about yourself? Leave a “🌹” if it doesn’t impact you in any way & a “🥀” if it leaves you feeling less than/worse about yourself.

In 2023, I hope that beauty can be more inclusive & positive & focus on within, as it should. It starts with us rejecting all the unattainable trends & the narratives that are fed to us by the media & all those who benefit ($) from making us feel bad in our skin… We’ve got this! ✊

Read this before you set someone else’s body as your “body goals” 😬

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren’t yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else’s sets you up for failure… 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it’s VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don’t share what they look like 24/7 so you likely only see them at their “best”
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don’t show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might’ve been achieved by doing things that you simply can’t sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don’t look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you’re living in when you’re living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It’s really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn’t always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying “You are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were” so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it’s what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would’ve helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today 🦋

To finish this post off, I’m gonna leave you with ANOTHER poem that I loved recently:
“Today I asked my body what she needed…

I thought she might need more water, or protein, or greens, or yoga, or supplements, or movement.

But as I stood in the shower, reflecting on her stretch marks,
Her roundness where I would like flatness,
Her softness where I would like firmness,
All those conditioned wishes that form a bundle of never-quite-rightness,
She whispered very gently;

Could you just love me like this?”
- Hollie Holden 

Do you think you can? Leave a “🥰” in the comments if you think you can find it in yourself to accept & love yourself as you are. That doesn’t mean you can’t work on your health & fitness… In fact, focusing on your health is a huge form of self love. It just means you’ll appreciate your body in the process, not just “at the end” 💛

#normalisenormalbodies #normalizenormalbodies #unposed #instagramvsreality #allbodiesaregoodbodies #healthinspiration #effyourbeautystandards #confidenceboost",comments,"Possibly the most realistic weight loss post you’ll ever see & read. And that’s because this isn’t just a “weight loss transformation”. Let me tell you why...

In this post I’m not going to put my very worst photos beside my very best because I wanna get REAL. 

In the photos on the left, I was 20kgs heavier, I had a really bad relationship with food and my body image. I was disgusted by my body & all of the things I initially considered “flaws”: my cellulite, my rolls, my bloated tummy, everything. I couldn’t bear to see my own reflection. 

But just in case you have the impression that weight loss is going to magically fix all the things you’re insecure about, I wanted to show you from my own experience that even though you think losing weight is going to make you happy or erase all of your insecurities... It probably won’t. Even now, after I’ve lost 20kgs, I still get bloated, I still have cellulite, I still have rolls when I sit, dips in my hips and a lower belly bump. But the difference NOW is that I understand the definition of flaw (“a mark or other imperfection which weakens a substance or object”) does not apply to any part of my body — does cellulite, bloating & a lower belly bump WEAKEN me??? Absolutely heckin’ NOT. See, self-acceptance happens on the INSIDE!

What I’ve realised along the way is that this was a HEALTH & HAPPINESS transformation... Not a weight loss transformation. I live a healthy lifestyle because I love my body, not because I hate it. So no matter what journey you’re on right now, remember all the amazing things your body is doing for you, not just the way it looks. Be kind to your body, fuel it well, live a healthy balanced lifestyle, exercise because you can — not because you have to, and my gosh, just enjoy your life... 💛

Happy Real Me Monday!!! Over the past 6+ months of me posting this series, I’ve received a lot of BEAUTIFUL comments, but I’ve also received some comments from people who think that because I’m thin, I shouldn’t have a voice in this “body image” space… So I wanted to dive into that a little in today’s post.

What’s the difference?

Body confidence = an individual’s acceptance of themselves. When we have body confidence, we accept how we look & appreciate what our bodies can do.

Body positivity = this is about acceptance of MARGINALISED bodies in society no matter their physical weight or size. 

So no, I can’t speak for the body positivity movement, but I am all for it! My posts fit into the body confidence category because my body is not marginalised & is considered “socially acceptable”. So, YES I’ve struggled with my body image, experienced disordered eating, suffered from the pressures of diet culture & picked myself apart because of the way I looked, BUT I’ve also had the benefits of thin privilege too:
-I don’t have people judging me for my food choices
-I don’t experience judgement or harassment for my weight
-I am generally assumed to be healthy
-I’ve always found my size at the store 

For me, I post this series because I’d much rather showcase my body’s normalities than portray perfection! I post these photos now because it’s what I wish I saw when I was underweight & unhappy. I wish I knew that being thin wasn’t going to make me feel confident automatically. I wish I knew that most of the photos I saw online were edited & posed to create a certain shape. I wish I realised sooner that I’m so much more than my appearance.

I hope that by seeing more REAL bodies on your feed, it might relieve the pressure you feel to conform to an impossible beauty standard & allow you to actually ENJOY YOUR LIFE!

Comment with a “🙋‍♀️/🙋‍♂️” if you’ve ever struggled with your body image! You’re not alone, but I hope these weekly posts may encourage you along the way ✨

Happy Real Me Monday! 🤗 Each of these photos were taken a few seconds apart. Both are me. Both are healthy. Both are good enough | ad

But that’s not how I’ve always viewed myself. From 10 years old, I started viewing my body negatively. So these weekly reminders are for those girls like 10-year-old me who were desperate to see other women like them: unposed, unedited, someone REAL.

How old were you when you became aware of your body image? & how old are you now that you’re focusing on improving your relationship with it? 🥰

Here are some ideas that may help:
🌷 over the years, your body will change, expand, roll, bulge, wrinkle, stretch, sag & grow. So learning to accept it now is a priority 🤍
🌷 move your body & nourish it well, because health is about how you treat your body, not how it appears externally
🌷 avoid comparing yourself to other people. Her beauty doesn’t take away from yours!
🌷 see yourself as a whole person, not an imperfect body part
🌷 practice positive self-talk — remember, your brain is always looking to confirm what you tell it, so the more positivity you tell yourself, the more you’ll seek & find it!
🌷 consume content online that makes you feel good, not worse! 
🌷 appreciate what your body does for you: it keeps you alive, takes you wherever you need to go, it FEELS, tastes, hears, sees & smells. It’s the vessel you get to experience life in, but it’s not WHO YOU ARE.

The more we see natural bodies, the more others will feel encouraged to embrace theirs too. I love when I see a woman with similar features to me because when I see her I think “HOT DANG she looks amazing WITH those features, not DESPITE them!”

Here’s your weekly reminder to not punish yourself or compare yourself to others 🙅🏻‍♀️

Comparing my body to a super strong athlete doesn’t make sense… Because I don’t train hours every day for sport or have a lot of muscle on my body burning through energy.

Comparing myself to a curvy goddess doesn’t make sense either… Because that’s not the way my body is built. I’m built like a door, not an hourglass & THAT’S OKAY 👌🏼 

Comparing my relaxed, everyday self to the posed & perfected photos of people online is setting myself up for failure… Because it’s not realistic. Most people only post their very “best” photos & you can’t compare your 99% to someone else’s 1%. 

The point is: comparison is the thief of joy! Comparing yourself to ANYONE doesn’t make sense… Neither does setting someone else’s body as your “body goals” because we are all unique, with unique habits, lifestyles, genetics, stresses, sleeping patterns, health concerns & body types (the list goes on).

It’s so important to fill your social media feed with diversity, so you never forget that beauty & bodies don’t just look one way. Find people who fuel positive thoughts & don’t leave you feeling worse! At the end of the day, your appearance is the least interesting thing about you. Here are some things that matter more:

🧠 Your mindset
🤗 The people you love
💭 The memories you make
🤝 Believing in yourself
🕺🏼 Creating habits that bring you joy & purpose
🧖🏻‍♀️ FEELING good in your skin
🪄 Creating a positive space in your own mind
🙌 Not being your own bully
🧘🏻‍♀️ Looking after yourself internally 
👑 Not letting your body hold you back from the life you want!

Now go have an amazing week celebrating everything that you are! Happy International Women’s Day ✊💗

Every day you have a choice. You can either tell yourself limiting beliefs like “I can’t wear that” & “I’m not good enough” OR you can tell yourself “I can wear that!” & “I’m amazing!” 

Your beliefs become your reality. 

Swipe for a very similar photo from one of my first ever “Real Me Monday” posts from almost 2 years ago. Yes… I’ve been kickstarting the week like this every Monday for almost 2 years… Wowza 😳

When I first started posting these photos, it was to challenge myself to put my real self out there. At the time, I picked my appearance apart, was never “fit enough”, edited my photos to perfection & worried about people seeing my loose skin, bloated belly, cellulite (etc) in real life. But if I could just embrace what I had & let everyone else see the real me right here online, then I had nothing to hide, right? 

I had no idea that sharing these would help so many of you who were struggling with the same thoughts. The internet can be a sea of highlights, perfect photos & aesthetics, but I’ve realised how many of you crave realness, so if these weekly reminders help just one person, it’s worth it!

I was underweight when I first started posting this series, but skinny ≠ happy & struggling with your body image happens in all sizes, despite what the majority believes. I’ve gained weight since I first started posting these & have a much healthier body & mind, it’s the first time in my life I haven’t had any negative feelings about gaining weight 🥲 that GROWTH!

This process has helped me learn that it’s okay for my body to change, it’s helped me stop being restrictive, to live a balanced lifestyle, to embrace my body’s changes & all of the things I grew up feeling ashamed of. 

I promise it’s possible for you to find self-acceptance, food freedom, a healthy lifestyle & confidence in the body you’re in! Happy Real Me Monday 🥹🫶

As if one is better than the other.

As I was growing up, it was made abundantly clear that the desirable shape was the “hourglass”, with a thigh gap, tiny waist, curves in the right places, firm & toned. It was impossible to measure up. 

So there I was as a young adult, scanning over my body in the mirror only to see a lack of curves, decorated with all of those very normal womanly features we’re convinced to hate: cellulite, hip dips, bloating, stretch marks, belly rolls, thighs touching, body hair & fat on my body — which btw are all very healthy, normal parts of the human body.

So, I just wanted to remind you as you go into a new week & perhaps have some “new goals” thanks to a magazine headline like the one above… Your body is not a “shape”. 

It’s a vessel that keeps you alive. 

You’re here for a reason… 
To learn, love, grow, feel, teach, experience, laugh, reflect & connect
… not to simply “look pretty” or be a specific “shape” 😅🙄

For me to create the illusion that I have an hourglass body, I had to stand with my feet apart, my tummy tucked in, my arms held out, holding my hands over my thighs, EVERYTHING was tensed. My chest stretched outward & my 🍑 stuck backward. The list goes on. It’s unnatural. 

Your best body is whatever body you’re in when you’re feeling happy, healthy, comfortable & enjoying your life.

Remember, while you’re scrolling online, you’re seeing everyone the way they WANT you to see them. Don’t forget that the next time you find yourself comparing yourself to someone else, or setting their body as your new “goal” or standard. 

You are not them. You are uniquely you, and the world is a better place for it. 

Only you have the power to get more comfortable in your skin. Your body is your home. It’s the only one you’ll ever have. Nurture it, honour it, nourish it, move it, love it & respect it 💛

Happy Real Me Monday. Chat with you below 🌸

13,13,baby,"Life update  Yesterday I went to see our last foster baby for the final post placement visit. Because of lockdown we met in a park for a walk. Unfortunately it was cold, icy, drizzly and misty, so not the best conditions but it was lovely to see her again and she was so happy to see me. She has my heart forever ❤️ We are still taking a break from fostering just now, although our social worker emailed to ask me if we were ready to go back on the active list. I said I’d let her know. I’m thinking of this time as my “annual leave” so I’m enjoying having a bit of time and space to relax (and supervise home-learning, cope with lockdown etc). I got all my boxes of baby clothes out yesterday and sorted them back into size order. They tend to get all muddled up as I’m taking stuff out and putting it back in during a placement. I met a friend for a nice long walk yesterday afternoon. She updated me on the domestic violence situation. The abusive adult child has temporarily moved out as things got really bad and the police had to be called again, which meant social services got involved again, which means she risks losing her two year old if she doesn’t get him out of the house. Before he moved out, my friend also had the mum and two year old to stay in her house for three nights to keep them safe. She doesn’t know if she’s enabling the mum to not kick her son out by providing a safe space. Then after she’s told me all this, she says don’t tell anyone. I don’t have anyone to tell and I feel like the pressure is off a bit because things are happening (police, social services) to keep the little one safe. I don’t feel the same stress as I did a week ago. The mutual friend I did drop some pointers to had the mum and little one round for lunch and a chat, but the mum wouldn’t share any details so my friend is still the sole carrier of this secret. My friend and I still debate what the best way to support the mum going forward is. It reminds me of Janet Treasure’s how to support someone with an eating disorder, are you a dolphin or a whatever the other supporter-types were, I can’t remember now. Today the sun is shining and we are hoping to go for a family walk. The UK news is full of one police force yesterday fining two women £200 each for driving 5 miles from their house to go for a socially distanced walk with a cup of peppermint tea each, because they “left their local area” and “had a picnic”. Thankfully I don’t live in the jurisdiction of that police force but I’m still not sure who decides where your local area ends. We want to drive a couple of miles and then walk. I think that’ll be ok.",inpatient,"Question: How is the baby doing so far with the transition? When she came to stay with you did you know she would be leaving? Will you get to visit her ever after she leaves? Do you like the adopters? My daughter is around the same age and I have felt so sad and nervous for you guys all week.  Answer: Aw thankyou, thoughtful anon. So many questions…. let me answer them one by one.Baby is doing great with the transition so far. As we have progressed, she has had some periods of being unsettled when the adopters and me are all around, as she can sense something is changing and she is confused by who she wants and the different pulls on her emotions.When she came to stay with us, it was as a foster placement, so we always knew she would be moving on sooner or later. The government target is 26 weeks from court order for placement to final decision, so we had a rough idea she’d be with us 6 months or so, but you just never know. Things can change, she could have moved much earlier to a foster-to-adopt placement.Yes we have some scheduled visits after she leaves. Recent research has shown that contrary to what standard practice used to be, foster carers visiting the child soon after placement helps the child settle in their new placement. It reassures them that their attachment figures haven’t abandoned them, while they are still building their new attachment with their adopters. Also the adopters comforting them through the grief the baby naturally feels and expresses after seeing their precious foster carers helps build the baby’s attachment bond with the adopters.The adopters are lovely. We really like them. They are quite young and so full of energy, warmth and enthusiasm. We have got on with them really well and hope that after baby moves to them, and after we have done all our scheduled visits, they will still keep in touch with us.Thankyou for thinking of us, it is really a difficult and draining time with a lot of mixed emotions xx",home,"Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start….So first we had lockdown 1, where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was “Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives”Then that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was “Hands, Face, Space” ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had “Eat Out to Help Out”, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system 1-3 with varying rules on what we could and couldn’t do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown 2.0. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It’s not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can’t meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it’s the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There’s a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don’t follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined £10,000 for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan.",school,"Question: Why did you skip two grades? Answer: The first year I skipped was year 2. I went to a really small primary school and there wasn’t enough space in the classroom for us all. So the three oldest of us moved up to the other classroom and worked with the year above. At the end of that year, our parents decided whether we carried on with the year above or repeated the year. My parents decided I should carry on with the year above (the other two repeated the year).The second year I skipped was year 6 (final year of primary school). That was my parents decision, as I was already working a year ahead and I had finished all the maths work that the school had. My parents must have requested it but I don’t know the details of how it was negotiated. I remember an educational psychologist coming out and doing an assessment with me. I was only 9 so it’s all a bit hazy memories.I was just bright…. I guess these days it would be called “gifted and talented”…. and I had parents (well, my mum really, I think my dad just went along with it) who overvalued academic achievement. Also my Gran moved up a year at school and my mum moved up a year at school so there was a bit of an inheritance I suppose. However it stopped with me because there’s no way I would move my children ahead of their age group.",foster,"I’ve had a manic morning. Baby fed at 1.30am and 4.30am last night, which made for a rather broken night, although she did settle and sleep well in between. She just takes a long time to feed. Thankfully then she slept through till 8.30am, which gave me time to wave all the girls off to school with a bit of individual attention each on the way. All three of them managed to walk several times past their piles of clean laundry on the landing though 🙄 but I think that’s standard for teenagers. Baby fed and then I gave her her first bath since she came to us. She wasn’t impressed and cried the whole time till she was snuggly wrapped up in a towel again.    I had to phone d3’s new school as the issues that caused her to move schools just won’t die down. I think teenagers just don’t think about what they’re doing or what the consequences might be. I reported a threatening text d3 received to the police over the weekend so I’m waiting to hear back from them. This has gone on long enough. d3 needs the chance to settle at her new school without all this horribleness. Unfortunately the older brother of the girl who’s caused a lot of the problems at the old school was moved to d3’s new school a couple of years ago, and he is now sticking his oar in with some horrible comments. Managed to shovel some scrambled eggs (and toast!) in while hustling around and organising, then took baby out to the contact centre to see her mum. While baby was in contact, I went for a run. It was hard hard hard. I ended up in a local cafe where I enjoyed a blissful 20 minutes sitting down with a coffee before going back to collect baby. We arrived home about 12.15pm and it was such a relief to plonk myself down on the sofa. I’ve been waiting for the midwives to visit since then but there’s still no sign of them. I’m suspicious they’ve forgotten. Nothing ever goes smoothly in foster care. I’m tutoring in 45 minutes and I could do with them having been and gone by then! Seems unlikely eh.",family,"Question: I dont live in the UK so I dont know all the details, but from what I've seen it sounds like boris Johnson is not handling the coronavirus appropriately. Why aren't they shutting down and taking appropriate steps? It seems like he has made very insensitive comments about how some people will die and that he just doesnt care about the vulnerable population. I'm curious your thoughts Answer: Boris Johnson and his scientific advisors have made their recommendations on the basis of scientific predictions. I do understand the logic - we need around 60% of people to catch corona (and survive) so that we have herd immunity because this virus is likely to be a seasonal thing now. Also we need to flatten the peak of cases occurring now so that the healthcare system can cope. Plus people can only cope physically and emotionally with self isolating for finite lengths of time and may start disobeying it right at the critical time if we start too early. If we close the schools, grandparents may end up looking after the children thereby putting a vulnerable age group at more risk of catching it. Their model says schools would need to be closed for 13-16 weeks for it to be effective at preventing virus spread, which would clearly have a massive effect on the country.It’s true though that people will die. I think Boris said that so we all appreciate the severity of the situation and the importance of doing our bit - handwashing, self isolating etc. Unfortunately it did come across as a bit uncaring and when we look at what the rest of the world is doing, it’s hard to keep faith in the UK government that their policies are enough when many other governments clearly think differently.Partly also the UK is somewhat behind mainland Europe in the course of the pandemic. We still have relatively low numbers of covid 19. So their advice may change over the next few days and weeks as the situation changes.I’m following the BBC live news feed quite obsessively to keep up with the world situation.",run,"Thurs 27 Feb  The last thing H said to me this morning before he went to work was “Why don’t you just have a restful day today.” It seemed quite possible at 7am this morning, with the whole day stretching ahead of me.  I got a text from d3 in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said “Can you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.” Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an 85 minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d1 had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn’t pass 😭. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn’t a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I’d ordered wasn’t there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn’t ordered was there. So we made a profit of 6 packs of brioche, 4 packs of krispie cakes, 3 bags of crisps and 24 eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I’d sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d3’s medical needs, I was rather hoping my 5pm tutee would cancel, but she didn’t. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D1’s bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I’m finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week’s episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice. I’m nibbling on dark chocolate and raspberry coated almonds which I bulk ordered online as a nutrition dense snack to help push my intake up after my long runs.  Tomorrow I am hoping for a proper restful day. All my children may make it out of the house (d3 has improved as the day has gone on and hopes to make it back to school tomorrow) and I may even get chance to paint the bannisters!",house,"Prodigious
 
 beckelstein: 

 I find it odd how the fandom focuses so much on Aang’s childhood being ruined when he learned he was the Avatar at 12, but there’s very little talk about how discovering she was the Avatar as a toddler affected Korra’s life and how she was raised. But we’ll circle back to that… Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters – That is the Child Prodigy.  We’ll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O2 or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).  All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let’s be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.  And that become a problem for one asshole in particular…  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai’s maniacal ego couldn’t handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn’t the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this…  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering 3 of the 4 Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).  Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.  Aang/Sokka/Katara’s story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.  Now, let’s talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.   Yes, of course I’m talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph’s family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka’s arm in environment where her bending couldn’t help her “see”.  Toph’s story is a foil to Azula’s, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph’s story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.         Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we’ll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara’s potential and Sokka’s genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many 15 yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka’s character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season. Not to mention that because he wasn’t a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can’t be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations’ actions.  Toph’s anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn’t as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.  While Toph’s talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka’s wasn’t acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you’re thinking. Zuko wasn’t a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn’t catch up with Azula’s until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).  Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It’s possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).  As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another’s talent it’s quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.  This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko’s early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy’s cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  “Azula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born”  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we’ve covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It’s well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We’ll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.  When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras’ and other Avatars’ lives.  1. She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other 3 elements, buy also many things about the 3 other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naiveté about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. 2.  She was trained and mastered 3 of the elements by the time she was 16. Most Avatars don’t know they have this power until they reach 16 and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra’s natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang’s, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep.1 she lacked restraint. I’m not saying her bending isn’t great, but rather because it is so great it’s her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naiveté of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.   Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through 4 seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the 4th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend 3 elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?  It’s a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.   Unlike Toph’s parents, Iroh worried over Zuko’s well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn’t want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn’t a prodigy like his sister.  And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.",babies,"Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care/ adoption in the UK is quite different to the US (where I imagine you might be?).Very very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don’t want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a 26 week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about 2 hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby’s future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it’s felt that’s a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).",staff,"Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that’s not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say 30 years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it’s up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that’s the foster care that we do. Then there’s permanence foster care. This is when the child won’t be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they’re 18+ and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there’s adoption, where usually there isn’t any contact with the birth family. There isn’t much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic 26 weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the 26(+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it’s done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were 30 years ago. However it’s one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day 1. To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past."

Hey guys! So I’m back with another full day of eating because you enjoyed the last one 😉 As you know, I’m training for the London marathon and this was filmed on a long run day 🏃🏻‍♀️ I usually eat quite a bit (🙃😏), but training often blows my appetite through the roof!!! Food is FUEL remember, so listen to your body and eat what makes you feel good 💚🙌🏻
-
Breakfast 001: Soaked oats with soy milk, sultanas and maple syrup as my pre-run fuel 💪🏻Oats sit well in my stomach but I may start experimenting with other foods before I run!
-
Breakfast 002: Honeydew melon, coconut water (amazing for replenishing electrolytes) and a classic Holly smoothie, blueberry edition 💜 I added bananas, frozen blueberries, frozen mango and pineapple, soy milk, water to blend, flaxseed powder, hemp seeds and salted caramel protein powder. All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for 37% off #affiliate) 🤓 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB 😏
-
LUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I’ll share the recipe soon 😉) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread 😅🤫
-
DINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol 😅). Oh plus more hemp seeds and pickles (bae 🥰)!!!
-
DESSERT: @myvegan cookie, a pear, frozen cherries and my fav almond milk 🤍

Hey guys! So this is your reminder to listen to your body, eat when you’re hungry and not put labels on foods! In the past, I wouldn’t eat chocolate because I considered it to be ‘unhealthy’ or I wouldn’t eat first thing in the morning because I ‘had’ to wait until after my workout … even though I’d wake up feeling hungry 🙄 You guys. Life is wayyyyyy way too short to not eat peanut butter from the tub ok 😅

001: Before my hill session (on my @strava) I had a banana, and as you guys know I always start my day with lots of water 💦
-
002: The recipe for my Purple Bae smoothie is in my Rainbow Smoothie Reel, and I had this alongside frozen fruit with flaxseed (I know this sounds strange but I actually love this combo 😉) and pb because it’s literally the best 😍
-
003: My sushi was definitely a fail, but it actually tasted really good!! I need to get a proper sushi making set, but I added leftover brown rice, cucumber, pepper and then topped it with tahini (not typical sushi, I know, and we didn’t have avocado sadly)! The recipe was by @minimalistbaker if you’re curious👌🏻Oh and the iced matcha latte was also a fail, but I’m working on it 🙈
-
004: Apples in the air fryer taste like apples from apple pie, which I love, and I had this with some @coconutcollab vegan custard, which is soooooo so thick and creamy 😍 10/10 recommend! I also had some chocolate as well by @montezumaschocs 🍫
-
005: My favourite thing to do for dinner at the moment is to chop up potatoes and other veggies to put in the air fryer with some beans, so today it was sweet potato, mushrooms and kidney beans. I then had more veg on the side, spinach, pickles (because I’ve been obsessed since birth lol), hemp seeds, nutritional yeast and hoisin sauce 🤩
-
006: My go-to oat bowl with a pear never fails me, and today I added some blueberries mixed it with more pb 🥜

002: My post-workout breakfast was a super thick blueberry smoothie filled with all the good stuff: bananas, frozen blueberries, rolled oats, soya milk, pea protein, flaxseed and maca powder 🫐 I supplement B12 as well as vitamin D at the moment too, just because the sunshine isn’t doing it for me right now in the UK 🙈

The recipe is written out down below for you all but let me just share a few mini-updates before that ok (cue Holly ramble / essay) 🙃 (1) I had a realllllllly good meeting with my supervisor on Wednesday about my project, which made me super duper happy (2) I’m, yes, watching Love Island because I low-key love that show. I sit, watch and laugh without having to do anything or use my brain cells, which is something we all need a bit more of in our lives I feel 🙌🏻 (3) I told my running trainer today that the second half of my run wasn’t amazing because I needed the toilet. And that is the level of transparency definitely needed around here 😂 (4) A big book update will be coming in the next official vlog, but you guysssss, ‘Where the Crawdads Sing’ left me nearly crying when I finished it the other week 😭

Ok recipe time: (1) Soak 1 cup of oats (I used rolled oats) the evening before in a very small volume of water just so they expand (2) To make the smoothie, blend 1/2 a banana, 200ml coconut milk, 1tbsp peanut butter, 2tbsp flaxseed powder and 1/2 frozen blueberries (3) Pour the smoothie over the oats, mix and top with the rest of the banana and whatever else you fancy (I love hemp seeds and frozen raspberries) 🍌🫐

Meanwhile, I hope today’s video serves as a small reminder to love yourself, your body and your own skin. I wanted to share some of my personal experiences, insecurities and practical tips that have helped me come to terms with appreciating who I am 💚✨",cacao,"If you’ve tried to make a smoothie bowl before, it may have ended like the Titanic where everything just sinks to the bottom 🤨😂😭 I almost lost the kiwi today, so I would have liked it a bit thicker, but it turned out ok in the end 👌🏻 Some of my tips to try and avoid such a tragic ending:
(1) Don’t add too much liquid. It will be a bit hard on the blender, especially if it isn’t that powerful, but it will get over it 😉 This may also take some trial and error, but just start off with a small amount of liquid and you can always add more. (2) Add something fairly thick to the smoothie. I added some soya milk that is pretty thick, but soya yoghurt for example would be even better. (3) Use non-frozen and frozen bananas. Not only will it help your blender, but the frozen ones will be icy and that will just add more liquid to your smoothie. 
Today I made a maca-strawberry smoothie as the base and topped it with a kiwi flower (because I like to be extra 😏), frozen blueberries, chia seeds and this granola/muesli by @dorsetcereals which is 👌🏻😍
And of course it is in my coconut bowl 🥥 (that was once, yes, a real coconut) 🤗 You can use HOLLY10 whenever you want discount 👏🏻 NEW VIDEO @ 6pm today guys, see you there 💚",oats,"catch me downing smoothie bowls all 👏🏼 summer 👏🏼 long 👏🏼 i refuse to have a smoothie if it’s not thick enough to spoon, and i know there’s lots of you out there who feel the same! here are my best smoothie bowl making tips that always deliver for me.
▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
• the ORDER of the ingredients matters! this is a point i’ve never seen anyone address and i’ve found it to make all the difference when building my bowls. i get the creamiest texture when i place my avocados in last. my usual order goes like this: chopped zucchini first, then rice frozen cauliflower, then whole frozen strawberries, then frozen blueberries, then fresh blueberries, then protein powder, then avocado, THEN pour nut milk over everything. i’ve found all of the ingredients blend better this way!
• the BLENDER can change the texture. i’ve posted this on my stories before but i have two different blenders at home and using the same exact recipe gave me two totally different results. my nutribullet tends to give a creamy texture but not very icy. i like my fruit ninja blender (but am getting a vitamix soon!)
• MILK matters! i just recently switched to @ripplefoods unsweetened vanilla pea milk for my smoothies and oatmeal. game changer! so much richer and creamier than almond milk.
•protein powder! my favorite is @nuzest_usa (code: “healthful_radiance”). i’ve tried so many plant based proteins but this is always my favorite! the vanilla pairs super well with frozen berries 👏🏼
• JUST enough of everything. i don’t measure any ingredients, but a little goes a long way. i usually use half of a medium zucchini or one small one, and maybe 1/2-1 cup of frozen riced cauliflower. i used to add soooo much of the cauliflower because i wanted more volume, but in the end it just makes it almost gritty because it’s so icy.
• TIME! dont overblend the mix, i usually do two minutes TOPS.
• NOT a building tip but an important reminder: it’s so easy to swallow a smoothie bowl in 2 minutes tops (guilty)! next time you eat one remember how much food goes into the mix. take the time to eat slowly and mindfully. you wouldn’t inhale an entire meal of veggies and fruits that fast! 
now get blending babes!",almond,"THICCCC oats or RUNNYYYYY oats, please cast your vote down below 😏🤨

So if you know me well, you will have certainly been acquainted with the fact that Holly loves THiCK oats. The thicker the better ok. But guys. I’ve recently started enjoying runny oats too sometimes, which is a shock horror I know 😱😅
-
Now I’m not saying I’d don’t like my porridge (or oatmeal, whichever term you prefer 🙃) thick like cake anymore, but I’m just here branching out a bit and living my best life in the runny oats club from time to time 😁
-
Anyway, here are my 5 tips for making a successful bowl of oats (lol that sounds funny, but we’re going with it): (1) You need to decide if you want it thick or thin, from the start because as I said, this determines the ratio of oats to liquid you add 🥣 (2) For speed, I make oats in the microwave or even just by adding boiling water (3) If you’re mixing in powders, like maca, cacao or protein powder for example, I always mix it in with plant milk so it blends nice and smooooooothly (4) To add sweetness to your oats, mash and mix in a banana (5) Toppings. are. everything!!! This is my favourite part and my friends, the world is your oyster here. Berries, banana, nut butter, hemp seeds, maple syrup, cacao nibs . . . literally go crazy with toppings ok, and thank me later👌🏻

These bowls, fyi, you may recognise from my video where I followed Mum’s day in the life, and here she went from some frozen blueberries, raspberries and maple syrup to keep it sweet and simple 😍✨",code,"Monday mornin’ smoothie bowlin’ 🍌🥝 I blended 2 frozen bananas, 1 and 1/2 non-frozen bananas, a handful of frozen mango, 3 big frozen strawberries and some water, plus a bit of almond milk for extra creaminess and some maca powder (which is completely optional and just adds a little extra dimension 😏). Of course, I poured it into my coconut bowl and topped it with the remaining banana, frozen berries, hemp seeds, kiwi, almonds and puffed rice 😍 What did you eat for breakfast this morning (and please don’t tell me nothing because remember people, it is the 👏🏻most 👏🏻 important 👏🏻 meal 👏🏻 of 👏🏻 the 👏🏻 day 👏🏻) Tell me down below 😉",protein,"We have a definite deficit of food posts going on right now, so here was my breakfast bowl the other day post an early morning spin class. I mentioned on my story recently that I’ve been diversifying my workouts, and my two new favourites are spin classes down at my local gym and netball on a Sunday (both of which will be featured in today’s vlog, hint hint the ☕️ challenge)!!! I don’t workout at the same time of day as a set routine, because I prefer to change it up a bit to match how my body is feeling. If I workout first thing then I will usually go fasted and eat afterwards, however since spin in super intense (45 minutes of power cycling 😅) I will eat a few dates or a banana beforehand for a boost of energy. It’s getting the balance right between not eating too much before the class (and feeling slightly ill 😂) but fuelling your muscles that’s key.

If all goes to plan, the vlog will be up as 6pm as usual today. This breakfast bowl (and all other meals 😉) will be featured, but I’ll give you the breakfast bowl deets in the meantime:

@alpro berry yoghurt mixed with 1 scoop of @vivolife protein powder (açai and blueberry flavour), 1 diced apple, 1/2 fresh banana (and the rest was eaten whilst making it), chia pudding, fresh blueberries, 1/2 cup oats & shredded coconut 🥥",blueberries,"Breaking up the New York feed with a smoothie bowl post because we’re back in Cam for the last few weeks 😬 My breakfast today doesn’t quite look the same as we need to go food shopping, but I made this on the day after my exams. It’s got in it 3 bananas (2 frozen & 1 non-frozen), half a scoop @vivolife açai & blueberry raw protein powder, frozen mango, spinach, water & flaxseed. I then topped it with a plum, puffed oats, coconut, a kiwi & frozen berries 😍 If anyone remembers from my vlog the other week this was my pre 10K run fuel 💪🏻
We’re currently on day 3 of the daily uploads this week and I am super excited about today’s video 😏 I’ve been wanting to do this for agessssss now and I can finally sit down and do it! 
I also now have under a week to find a May Ball dress (getting slightly worried 😅), a lot of planning to do for my next travel adventures & even more planning for business-y related stuff I’m starting to work on ..... It sounds like I know what I’m doing but really they’re all just ideas and I need to actually work out how I’m going to do it all 😂😆"
