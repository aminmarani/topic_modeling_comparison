1,1,home,Day 36 of inpatient was okay. I didn‚Äôt sleep well last night (as usual). I went to a couple groups but didn‚Äôt really like them. My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I‚Äôve basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I‚Äôm just so tired all the time and I don‚Äôt want to be awake.,morning,Day 31 of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I‚Äôm sad but also happy for her.,last,Day 27 of inpatient was boring. I woke up early and couldn‚Äôt fall back asleep. I watched some tv and then went back to sleep. Then I spent some time with friends and went on a walk. Then I went back to sleep. I slept through most of today so I guess my mood was okay. I‚Äôm still really sad about my favorite nurse leaving.,night,Day 37 of inpatient was pretty good. My roommate and I made posters and decorated our room. Then I went on a walk. It was cold but nice to get fresh air. My aunt came to visit and brought me food so that was nice. Then I hung out with my roommate and just chilled. Overall I feel pretty okay.,days,Breakfast is always the culprit. Either i wake up super hungry and have a hefty meal or i stay in bed till noon and skip breakfast completely. I have a bigger lunch though to make up for it. So i guess its fine.,went,"New jeans  I bought two new pairs of jeans on Friday, the same brand, size and style as my old ones which fitted just fine but had worn through.

I played Pictionary with my friends and it was really fun. I‚Äôm starting ect tomorrow and I‚Äôm nervous. I hope it goes well.,run,Day 34 of inpatient was just okay. I got a one hour pass so I got to walk my dogs on the grounds. I slept most of the day so it wasn‚Äôt very productive. I was supposed to see Dear Evan Hansen tonight but instead I‚Äôm in the hospital. I was really looking forward to going and I‚Äôm bummed I‚Äôm not there.,friends,"Phew I just went out with d1 for her first driving practice in our car. Omg it‚Äôs quite terrifying being at the mercy of a 17 year old behind the wheel of your car! She‚Äôs had 10 hours of lessons. She‚Äôs doing pretty well really although she doesn‚Äôt like to go past second gear (and I‚Äôm not complaining because the few times we got into third gear felt like we were going far too fast). We drove a few miles down a long quiet road twice and did a couple of loops of an estate. Driving instructors are heroes. I couldn‚Äôt do that all day every day, my nerves would be shot. If I wasn‚Äôt toying with being sober for October, I‚Äôd have a glass of wine right now."

3,3,therapy,"Therapy 21.07.20 // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn‚Äôt keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she‚Äôd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don‚Äôt do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we‚Äôve been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don‚Äôt mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don‚Äôt say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that‚Äôs exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs likely what I‚Äôm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I‚Äôm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It‚Äôs what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I‚Äôm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I‚Äôm just telling you that if you‚Äôre waiting for me to do it, I probably won‚Äôt.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we‚Äôll have year from then to process our ending. I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you‚Äôll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that‚Äôs all very well, but I hope she knows I‚Äôm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven‚Äôt really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just not ready to be without her.",session,"Therapy 28.01.19 // screenshot 1 // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. ‚ÄúAvoidant attachment‚Ä¶. yes, yes I see that in you‚Ä¶‚Äù. She carries on reading. ‚ÄúHmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents‚Ä¶. How did it feel to read that?‚Äù I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn‚Äôt really resonate. So I tried again. It‚Äôs kind of proof‚Ä¶ not that I think you were making it up‚Ä¶. but that you weren‚Äôt just being nice‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That‚Äôs when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had 30 seconds of the session left and she laughed and said ‚Äúok attachment theory in 30 seconds, come on T, get on with it!‚Äù. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.",bit,"Therapy 10.11.19 // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said ‚ÄúOk Faith, I‚Äôm just letting you know I‚Äôm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.‚Äù We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said ‚ÄúSo tell me about [something].‚Äù I can‚Äôt even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It‚Äôs like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it‚Äôs just agreeing the usual time and day, it‚Äôs a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I‚Äôm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.",talk,"Therapy 14.07.20 // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or‚Ä¶, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs not a Perfect cake‚Äù said T, ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs just a Good Enough cake.‚Äù That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I‚Äôm in a ‚Äòwhich cake‚Äô dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don‚Äôt want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I‚Äôm away (benefits of online therapy y‚Äôall).",therapist,"Therapy 28.04.20 // boundaries   I can‚Äôt really write too much about what‚Äôs been going on with the baby and video contact with her birth parents, but it hasn‚Äôt been going smoothly. There have been some issues with the contact sessions and some issues with inappropriate text message contact since birth parents have had to have my phone number. In amongst all my other wailing in therapy, T asked me how the baby was, and that got me started on the issues I‚Äôve been having with her parents. I hadn‚Äôt really intended to bring these issues up in therapy because in themselves they‚Äôre not a big deal. They need resolving practically which I can take to my supervisors to do. And I know it‚Äôs ok to have my boundaries around them, I just need to be sure that I‚Äôm not overstepping my authority in the boundaries that I set. But anyway, I was on a roll and the words all just tumbled out of my mouth. ‚ÄúThey send me messages and pictures late at night, and in itself that‚Äôs not really a problem. I just don‚Äôt open the message‚Ä¶.. even if I go on WhatsApp, I just don‚Äôt go into that conversation‚Ä¶. but it makes me think‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ it makes me think, is that what it‚Äôs like for you?‚Äù Thankfully T understood what I was asking. ‚ÄúHmm are you saying, that you feel exasperated with them for sending messages, and you wonder if I feel exasperated with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh not so much exasperated, it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. I just think I‚Äôll leave their message till the morning. But it makes me internally roll my eyes a bit and think what are they sending me that for??‚Ä¶.. I don‚Äôt know, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in the middle‚Ä¶. like, they‚Äôre doing it to me, and I‚Äôm doing it to you‚Ä¶‚Äù This is the sort of stuff that if I think of it before the session and plan to talk about it, it takes me ages and great effort to get the words out. Yet here I am unplanned, spilling these feelings out. T replied ‚ÄúMmm I hear what you‚Äôre saying, but baby‚Äôs parents are not sticking to any boundaries. Whereas I feel that you have always been respectful of my time and of the boundaries. There‚Äôs only been a handful of times in what‚Ä¶ 7? 8?‚Ä¶ years of us working together where you‚Äôve messaged me and I‚Äôve felt like that.‚Äù T smiled at me reassuringly. ‚ÄúYou do respect the boundaries, Faith.‚Äù  I feel a bit reassured but I‚Äôm still uncertain. I had a real fear when I noticed my feelings about birth parents randomly messaging me, that what if this is what T feels when I message her? I don‚Äôt know what would be worse, her feeling angry or frustrated with me for messaging out of session, or her just feeling this blank indifference with me similar to what I notice I feel about the birth parents‚Äô messages. ‚ÄúFaith I just need to tell you that it‚Äôs 9.45am [5 minutes to go] ‚Ä¶. but I think this is important, I think we need to come back to it. We need to think about your boundaries and that it‚Äôs ok to have them‚Äù I don‚Äôt think we need to come back to it. I don‚Äôt want to use my therapy session to trouble shoot this issue. It‚Äôs not a boundary issue that‚Äôs bothering me, I‚Äôm happy to set my boundaries with the birth parents and to check that out with my supervisor. It‚Äôs more about projecting how I felt onto how T feels. T asked me if I came to therapy today planning to say all this - ‚ÄúWas this what you wanted to talk about, or did it just come up?‚Äù I said it kind of just came up. T repeated that it was important and that it was about boundaries and about what the limits of my role are. After the session, I thought that my role with the birth parents is quite different to my therapist‚Äôs role with me. So maybe the way my feelings respond to their messages are different to how T feels in response to my messages.",felt,"I texted T that quote I posted yesterday and said omg it‚Äôs me. She replied ‚Äúyes, it is you‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre learning that your feelings are valid now‚Äù I first came across the quote as I was looking something else up in the book, and it really reminded me of how things were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet looking calm on the outside. That is definitely a thing I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It‚Äôs strange to think it‚Äôs not normal actually. Doesn‚Äôt everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone‚Äôs brain works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else‚Äôs. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that‚Äôs probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I‚Äôve never really spoken about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was ‚Äúquite avoidant‚Äù when it came up in conversation over something, but that‚Äôs about it. Of course it‚Äôs been referred to in the context of my responses to other things, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever therapists do when they figure out the theory of what‚Äôs going on with their clients. I think it‚Äôs perhaps something to talk about a bit more next session,",ok,"Therapy 17/09/19  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. ‚ÄúTry me‚Äù she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get the words in the right order.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMmm just try saying some of the words and we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn‚Äôt anticipating her to (in my head I said ‚Äúwhen you say a load of whacky things‚Äù but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn‚Äôt say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm ‚Äúno‚Äù. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter‚Äôs situation is completely separate to me.",talking,"We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said ‚ÄúI think I need to talk about something else now‚Äù which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I‚Äôm not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. ‚ÄúShall I ask you some questions then?‚Äù she said, and I nodded. She carried on ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ ok‚Ä¶ children‚Ä¶ holidays‚Ä¶ the baby‚Ä¶ what shall we go with?‚Ä¶ oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I‚Äôve hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there‚Ä¶. So, what‚Äôs happening with her future?‚Äù I started telling T about the plans for the baby‚Äôs future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by 7 minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I‚Äôve had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we‚Äôve talked about, but this week I don‚Äôt seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits.",last,"Question: Hiya, I was interested in your advice- I have a therapist that I really like, but we just don‚Äôt see eye to eye on one particular issue. I‚Äôve been feeling this way for ages but I‚Äôm too scared to bring it up in session. Now I‚Äôm not seeing her this week and naturally this problem is all I can think about. The worst part of me just wants to give up and run away and just ghost her but I feel like I should face the problem head on?? Would it be bad to text her about it now? Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don‚Äôt know what your therapists rules on texting are so I can‚Äôt know how she‚Äôd respond if you texted her. Also if it‚Äôs an issue that you know you don‚Äôt see eye to eye on, then it‚Äôs really best discussed in a therapy session rather than by text, so you don‚Äôt end up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you‚Äôve been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next session? That way it puts it on the agenda but keeps the conversation for the therapy room. The fact that you‚Äôre thinking about it a lot this week probably means it‚Äôs an important topic for you to discuss. You could even talk around it in session for a while, saying you have something to talk about but you‚Äôre worried, you know don‚Äôt see eye to eye about it, you‚Äôre really scared to bring it up, it makes you just want to run away and not come to therapy anymore. That helps your therapist understand what an important thing it is for you.When I‚Äôve approached stuff that way with my T, she reminds me that we‚Äôve talked about hard stuff before, that she hasn‚Äôt got upset about certain topics, that she has been really happy that I‚Äôve felt safe enough to bring these things up, proud that I‚Äôve been brave enough to say them etc etc. That helps me build up the courage to bring up the difficult thing.Hope that helps anon x",maybe,"Therapy 23.02.21 // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. ‚ÄúThis week‚Äôs been a bit difficult‚Ä¶. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about‚Ä¶ uh, things I‚Äôd been holding all week‚Ä¶ and then I didn‚Äôt get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.‚Äù I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they‚Äôre falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn‚Äôt say that so I didn‚Äôt have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum‚Äôs facebook post and then I hadn‚Äôt had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she‚Äôs saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It‚Äôs good to not get things wrong but it‚Äôs also good to get things wrong ü§îü§Ø hence‚Ä¶. the therapist is always right??"

- 1/2 cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
- 1 cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- 1/2 cup coconut yogurt (plain)
- 2 tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

- 1 cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
- 2 tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to 350F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for 35-40 min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i‚Äôd say make the frosting and then remove 1/3 of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

If those reminders up there aren‚Äôt enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don‚Äôt is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn‚Äôt brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can‚Äôt possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they‚Äôre someone‚Äôs very best photo, they‚Äôre the highlight of someone else‚Äôs life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it‚Äôs close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled 24/7 either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I‚Äôm so grateful for it üëèüèª

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! ü•≥

They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too.¬†

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

It‚Äôs going to be a lil appreciation post every Monday for all the in-between, realistic photos that didn‚Äôt make the cut üòÇ just to remind you at the start of each week that you see 1 out of 100+ photos from someone‚Äôs day on social media... And it‚Äôs always the best one. Most of the time, Instagram is a highlight reel of someone‚Äôs life and it makes our bad days (and even our ordinary days) seem WAAAY worse in comparison. So here‚Äôs some examples of my ‚Äòbest‚Äô and most natural side by side ‚Äî the last one is my fav & realest side-by-side for IG VS reality üò≥üëèüèª

If you could create your own beauty standards... What would that look like? Hopefully it would look like the person you see when you look in the mirror and be everchanging as you grow older.

Cellulite, stretch marks, acne scars, arm flab, small curves, bloated bellies, hairy bodies, (the list goes on) aren‚Äôt imperfections... You aren‚Äôt flawed because of these things, you‚Äôre HUMAN & a worthy one at that! 

I see photos of supermodels on my Instagram explore page ALL. THE. TIME... Do I think they‚Äôre beautiful? Yes, they‚Äôre stunning! But do I think I‚Äôm less beautiful because of them? Not at all. We‚Äôre all built differently and made up of so many unique features, qualities & values that make us US. Embrace that! ‚ú®

I‚Äôm sure we all have that friend who can‚Äôt see how beautiful they are, they make negative comments about their appearance around you and you just can‚Äôt understand how they don‚Äôt see how gorgeous they are, right? Well, girlfriend, THAT‚ÄôS YOU! YOU‚ÄôRE THE FRIEND & YOU‚ÄôRE AMAZING. (And so many other people see it in you too!) Okay? Coool, glad we got that sorted ü•∞

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn‚Äôt mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
‚Äî‚Äî
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there‚Äôs been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can‚Äôt expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
‚Äî‚Äî

maybe you‚Äôve struggled with saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to things that you should have said ‚Äúno‚Äù to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react‚Ä¶

but here‚Äôs what can happen when we do this:

‚úñÔ∏éwe don‚Äôt have time for our own personal affairs

‚úñÔ∏éwe don‚Äôt show up 100% for that project/event

‚úñÔ∏éwe take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

‚úñÔ∏éwe become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

‚ú®what about when you say ‚Äúnot right now, but i appreciate the thought?‚Äù ‚ú®

some things that might happen: 

‚ùÄyou show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

‚ùÄyou strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

‚ùÄyou prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

‚ùÄyou give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

‚ùÄothers either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can‚Äôt do at that time

‚ùÄyou release the responsibility of someone else‚Äôs emotions (whew! that‚Äôs a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your ‚Äúno‚Äù can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

‚Äî‚Äî
while i‚Äôve come a long way with letting go, i have days where i get caught up in the should‚Äôves, could‚Äôves, and would‚Äôves too. some days, my mind naturally goes to beating myself up about something that‚Äôs already happened, and it can be really hard to stop it, let go, and move on especially when it seems that there are reminders constantly.
‚Äî‚Äî
what i try to remind myself of is that enforcing feelings guilt and regret has NEVER ever been good for me, but being my own friend and giving myself grace can help create space for me to grow and heal.

i am ending 2020 feeling the most me ME i think i‚Äôve ever felt, and i don‚Äôt think i would‚Äôve felt this way if it wasn‚Äôt for all the unexpected and challenging events and circumstances we were all forced to face this year.

the past couple years, i‚Äôve made my main intention ~letting go~, and this year was the year i was truly able to feel the internal shifts happening within me.

one of the hardest parts about letting go for me was that it can take longer (sometimes a lot longer) to let go of thoughts than it is of actions. just because i had stopped harmful behaviors didn‚Äôt mean i wasn‚Äôt fighting an internal battle that in many ways felt even harder and more painful than the initial fight to change my actions.

not enough people tell you that the healing often hurts a lot more than the breaking,

but the journey to feeling whole again,

to feeling like YOU again is worth it.

In fact, I don‚Äôt share most things about my life. There are a ton of really low points that I never talk about as well as some really happy moments that I don‚Äôt share.  Even knowing that I only share a fraction of my own life on social media, I‚Äôm still human and sometimes get caught up in comparing myself to other people‚Äôs accounts.

we are human. we form attachments. we seek safety. we crave familiarity. we have a hard time letting go, even if holding on is hurting us.

if you need to hear it: it‚Äôs okay if you are having a hard time letting go. it is not your fault if you are struggling. believe it or not, that harmful thing you are still holding to had a purpose- it helped you feel safe when life felt scary. i know it is SO hard to let go of that security blanket, but i also know that you can do it.

23 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they‚Äôre easier to deal with, and when good times come, they‚Äôre more fully enjoyed.

it‚Äôs moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i‚Äôve come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

you know how someone can tell you that you‚Äôre smart, amazing, and beautiful 50 times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn‚Äôt really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you‚Äôre incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn‚Äôt feel right if i didn‚Äôt share about my hard days too. i‚Äôve mentioned that i‚Äôve been struggling a bit lately, and if i‚Äôm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.
