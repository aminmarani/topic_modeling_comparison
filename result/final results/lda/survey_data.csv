relearning who they are after years of trying to be someone they're not,

letting go of relationships that don't serve them,

fighting to keep going despite thoughts that make life feel impossibly hard,

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

this picture was taken a year ago and behind my smile, i remember the struggles. when i am having a hard time, it's so important for me to put things in perspective because even just one  year ago me never would've thought i could get to where i am at now",better,"i doubt myself pretty frequently.  in my career, on social media, in conversations, and in a lot of other aspects too.  i've come a long way from the times when i questioned my mere existence, but i still question my abilities, qualities, and knowledge quite a bit.

imposter syndrome is something i think almost everyone has experienced at some point, but that doesn't mean that doubting yourself and your life needs to be accepted as the norm. sure, discomfort is a big part of growth, and the ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù mindset has its place, but believing in yourself is also one of the most powerful things you can do.

something i like to remind myself of when i feel consumed by thoughts of self doubt is that you can't live your life fully, abundantly, and as your most authentic self if you are focusing on the things you lack.

you don't have to know how everything's going to work out to believe that it will, but constantly worrying for something bad to happen and focusing on what you don't have is not the mindset that will lead to happiness, peace, and abundance.

reminders:
you are worthy.
you are capable.
you are enough.
you bring something unique to the table.
the world needs your light and contributions.
everything will be okay.",years,"someone else's reality is never going to be the exact same as your own.

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
‚Äî‚Äî
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

maybe you've struggled with saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to things that you should have said ‚Äúno‚Äù to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react‚Ä¶

but here's what can happen when we do this:

‚úñÔ∏éwe don't have time for our own personal affairs

‚úñÔ∏éwe don't show up % for that project/event

‚úñÔ∏éwe take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

‚úñÔ∏éwe become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

‚ú®what about when you say ‚Äúnot right now, but i appreciate the thought?‚Äù ‚ú®

some things that might happen: 

‚ùÄyou show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

‚ùÄyou strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

‚ùÄyou prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

‚ùÄyou give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

‚ùÄothers either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can't do at that time

‚ùÄyou release the responsibility of someone else's emotions (whew! that's a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your ‚Äúno‚Äù can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

13,13,therapy,"Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. ‚ÄúAvoidant attachment‚Ä¶. yes, yes I see that in you‚Ä¶‚Äù. She carries on reading. ‚ÄúHmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents‚Ä¶. How did it feel to read that?‚Äù I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof‚Ä¶ not that I think you were making it up‚Ä¶. but that you weren't just being nice‚Ä¶ like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said ‚Äúok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!‚Äù. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.",session,"Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said ‚ÄúOk Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.‚Äù We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said ‚ÄúSo tell me about [something].‚Äù I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.",bit,"Therapy .. // how did we get here?  ‚ÄúWhere to today then?‚Äù I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. ‚ÄúSooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list‚Ä¶. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?‚Äù I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. ‚ÄúOk so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. so‚Ä¶ uh I just wanted to check in that‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ so I had this list we were talking about‚Ä¶ and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago‚Ä¶ and I guess I wanted to check that‚Ä¶. you know how we got here?‚Äù T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said ‚Äúhmm‚Ä¶ I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?‚Äù She thought a moment and said ‚ÄúMy recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you‚Ä¶. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions‚Ä¶. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?‚Äù I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said ‚ÄúEr, no.‚Äù T smiled. ‚ÄúOk, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.‚Äù T waited. ‚ÄúGo on! take the plunge‚Äù, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, ‚ÄúYes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -‚Äú  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  ‚Äú- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to ‚Äúmiss‚Äù each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.‚Äù  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said ‚ÄúUh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult‚Ä¶. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.‚Äù",therapist,"Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I'm just not ready to be without her.",talk,"Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says ‚ÄúWhere to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about‚Ä¶. what we were talking about last week?‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like I'm in a gap between those two things‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, well‚Ä¶. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?‚Äù I nod. T flips a page in front of her. ‚ÄúYou said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?‚Äù That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says ‚ÄúSo you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?‚Äù ‚ÄúNoooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm and did you feel that I felt like that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.‚Äù We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? ‚ÄúNo, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think‚Ä¶ I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit‚Ä¶ *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.‚Äù I hadn't ‚Äústopped eating‚Äù, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached.",felt,"Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. ‚ÄúTry me‚Äù she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. ‚ÄúI can't get the words in the right order.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out‚Äù Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said ‚Äúwhen you say a load of whacky things‚Äù but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm ‚Äúno‚Äù. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.",ok,"We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said ‚ÄúI think I need to talk about something else now‚Äù which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I'm not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. ‚ÄúShall I ask you some questions then?‚Äù she said, and I nodded. She carried on ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ ok‚Ä¶ children‚Ä¶ holidays‚Ä¶ the baby‚Ä¶ what shall we go with?‚Ä¶ oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I've hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there‚Ä¶. So, what's happening with her future?‚Äù I started telling T about the plans for the baby's future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by  minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I've had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we've talked about, but this week I don't seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it's a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits.",maybe,"I had therapy this morning and it felt like a very bland session. It didn't feel worth the session fee (although of course I will still pay it). The session ended and I wondered what we actually achieved. Last week we talked about my childhood, and as we ended, T said ‚Äúwe probably need to spend a bit more time thinking about this‚Äù. So I was all willing to talk about it some more this week but it's hard to open it all up again and it feels like we never got back as deep as we were the first time.  I think I wanted her to respond in certain ways to things I said, and when she didn't, I felt dissatisfied and frustrated. I kept working hard but it just wasn't really happening in my brain this week. I couldn't find the words to explain thoughts or feelings, I couldn't gather my thoughts enough to get them into words I wanted to say. I tried to go with what was coming up in my brain, which meant we jumped around a bit. I think it did work to an extent because I did eventually stop thinking about how we weren't connecting and how we weren't really getting into anything properly‚Ä¶. and I suppose when you stop thinking about it that's often because it's started happening. Ahh anyway. I will try and think of some positives of the session in a minute.",last,"Question: As a therapist, it's not about ‚Äúhow the therapist works‚Äù but how the parents work. I always follow the parents lead - so for some of my kiddos, that means we check in by phone monthly, some come into session when they are able/it feels helpful, and others I barely see. For the teenagers that have support from their parents and are dealing with stuff outside of that, it's really up to the parent when/how they want to touch base. Some stay in the waiting room and others don't! I don't read into it Answer: Ok but how do you know what the parents lead is? Do they just rock up in session one and say ok therapist, I'm going to ring you up every month so you can give me an update?",talking,"Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. ‚ÄúThis week's been a bit difficult‚Ä¶. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about‚Ä¶ uh, things I'd been holding all week‚Ä¶ and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.‚Äù I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong ü§îü§Ø hence‚Ä¶. the therapist is always right??"

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! üòç | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us ü•∞ the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

I used to post only my very best photos, and there's nothing wrong with posting photos you feel good in. But there was something wrong with the way I didn't feel good unless I looked 'perfect'. There was something wrong with the way that I wanted to impress other people to the detriment of my mental & physical health. There was something wrong with the way that I couldn't accept my body, the bloating, the rolls, the bulges, my cellulite, the way my body slouched & relaxed when I was completely comfortable. 

Honestly, beauty standards have changed SO much over the years. They're always changing, and we're always trying to shrink ourselves to fit them. So let's create our own beauty standards & make them as diverse as possible ü•∞

Beauty, to me, is a smile ‚Äî because it has the power to make another person smile, and their smile can make someone else smile, and so on until YOUR smile has created a hundred more without you even knowing your impact. Beauty is kindness. It is not a shape, height, style, race, weight, hair type, body type, or external physical trait. It's a mentality, it's subjective, it's something that comes from within, and... it also ISN'T EVERYTHING!

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human ‚Äî there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! üôà

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

Read this before you set someone else's body as your ‚Äúbody goals‚Äù üò¨

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure‚Ä¶ 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their ‚Äúbest‚Äù
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying ‚ÄúYou are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were‚Äù so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today ü¶ã

Happy Real Me Monday! üíê
