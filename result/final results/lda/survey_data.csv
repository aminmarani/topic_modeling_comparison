1,1,home,Day 36 of inpatient was okay. I didn’t sleep well last night (as usual). I went to a couple groups but didn’t really like them. My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I’ve basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I’m just so tired all the time and I don’t want to be awake.,morning,Day 31 of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I’m sad but also happy for her.,last,Day 27 of inpatient was boring. I woke up early and couldn’t fall back asleep. I watched some tv and then went back to sleep. Then I spent some time with friends and went on a walk. Then I went back to sleep. I slept through most of today so I guess my mood was okay. I’m still really sad about my favorite nurse leaving.,night,Day 37 of inpatient was pretty good. My roommate and I made posters and decorated our room. Then I went on a walk. It was cold but nice to get fresh air. My aunt came to visit and brought me food so that was nice. Then I hung out with my roommate and just chilled. Overall I feel pretty okay.,days,Breakfast is always the culprit. Either i wake up super hungry and have a hefty meal or i stay in bed till noon and skip breakfast completely. I have a bigger lunch though to make up for it. So i guess its fine.,went,"New jeans  I bought two new pairs of jeans on Friday, the same brand, size and style as my old ones which fitted just fine but had worn through. But ugh, brand new jeans are not comfy yet, and make me feel F A T",bed,"Throwing it back to summer and my favorite classic lunch 😛 That COLOR though! Spending this beautiful rest day grocery shopping with my dad, working on my papers, and chowing down on Sunday dinner (which I haven't had in FOUR WEEKS! FOUR!!!) I'm so pumped 😍😍😍😍",hours,Today was pretty good! I slept well for the first time in a long time so that was nice. I tried to go to groups but I ended up napping through most of them. I played Pictionary with my friends and it was really fun. I’m starting ect tomorrow and I’m nervous. I hope it goes well.,run,Day 34 of inpatient was just okay. I got a one hour pass so I got to walk my dogs on the grounds. I slept most of the day so it wasn’t very productive. I was supposed to see Dear Evan Hansen tonight but instead I’m in the hospital. I was really looking forward to going and I’m bummed I’m not there.,friends,"Phew I just went out with d1 for her first driving practice in our car. Omg it’s quite terrifying being at the mercy of a 17 year old behind the wheel of your car! She’s had 10 hours of lessons. She’s doing pretty well really although she doesn’t like to go past second gear (and I’m not complaining because the few times we got into third gear felt like we were going far too fast). We drove a few miles down a long quiet road twice and did a couple of loops of an estate. Driving instructors are heroes. I couldn’t do that all day every day, my nerves would be shot. If I wasn’t toying with being sober for October, I’d have a glass of wine right now."

3,3,therapy,"Therapy 21.07.20 // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn’t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she’d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don’t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we’ve been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don’t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don’t say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that’s exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that’s likely what I’m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I’m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It’s what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I’m not ready to go there. “No! I’m just telling you that if you’re waiting for me to do it, I probably won’t.” “What I’m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we’ll have year from then to process our ending. I’m thinking we’ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you’ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that’s all very well, but I hope she knows I’m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can’t believe I’ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven’t really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I’m just not ready to be without her.",session,"Therapy 28.01.19 // screenshot 1 // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn’t really resonate. So I tried again. It’s kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren’t just being nice… like it’s there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That’s when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had 30 seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in 30 seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.",bit,"Therapy 10.11.19 // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I’m just letting you know I’m going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can’t even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It’s like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it’s just agreeing the usual time and day, it’s a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I’m sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.",talk,"Therapy 14.07.20 // good enough cake  After the discussion about supervision, we talked about (surprise surprise) cake. I told T about my cake eating exploits from the week before and we processed that a bit. I said that one of the hardest things was choosing which cake to have, because I get caught up in a spiral of choosing the perfect one. And then I feel sure that if I just had more information or more time or or or…, then I would be able to know which one was perfect. “Maybe there’s not a Perfect cake” said T, “Maybe there’s just a Good Enough cake.” That felt quite a profound statement so I made sure I remembered it. I can imagine reminding myself of it every time I’m in a ‘which cake’ dilemma. Just choose a good enough one, Faith. After that there was just time to quickly ask her if she was going away in August, because we are and I wanted to know how therapy would fit around it. She is away for one week in August, and we are away for two different weeks. I don’t want to miss two weeks in a row so I think I might try and do a Skype call with her while I’m away (benefits of online therapy y’all).",therapist,"Therapy 28.04.20 // boundaries   I can’t really write too much about what’s been going on with the baby and video contact with her birth parents, but it hasn’t been going smoothly. There have been some issues with the contact sessions and some issues with inappropriate text message contact since birth parents have had to have my phone number. In amongst all my other wailing in therapy, T asked me how the baby was, and that got me started on the issues I’ve been having with her parents. I hadn’t really intended to bring these issues up in therapy because in themselves they’re not a big deal. They need resolving practically which I can take to my supervisors to do. And I know it’s ok to have my boundaries around them, I just need to be sure that I’m not overstepping my authority in the boundaries that I set. But anyway, I was on a roll and the words all just tumbled out of my mouth. “They send me messages and pictures late at night, and in itself that’s not really a problem. I just don’t open the message….. even if I go on WhatsApp, I just don’t go into that conversation…. but it makes me think… uh… it makes me think, is that what it’s like for you?” Thankfully T understood what I was asking. “Hmm are you saying, that you feel exasperated with them for sending messages, and you wonder if I feel exasperated with you?” “Uh not so much exasperated, it doesn’t bother me too much. I just think I’ll leave their message till the morning. But it makes me internally roll my eyes a bit and think what are they sending me that for??….. I don’t know, I feel like I’m stuck in the middle…. like, they’re doing it to me, and I’m doing it to you…” This is the sort of stuff that if I think of it before the session and plan to talk about it, it takes me ages and great effort to get the words out. Yet here I am unplanned, spilling these feelings out. T replied “Mmm I hear what you’re saying, but baby’s parents are not sticking to any boundaries. Whereas I feel that you have always been respectful of my time and of the boundaries. There’s only been a handful of times in what… 7? 8?… years of us working together where you’ve messaged me and I’ve felt like that.” T smiled at me reassuringly. “You do respect the boundaries, Faith.”  I feel a bit reassured but I’m still uncertain. I had a real fear when I noticed my feelings about birth parents randomly messaging me, that what if this is what T feels when I message her? I don’t know what would be worse, her feeling angry or frustrated with me for messaging out of session, or her just feeling this blank indifference with me similar to what I notice I feel about the birth parents’ messages. “Faith I just need to tell you that it’s 9.45am [5 minutes to go] …. but I think this is important, I think we need to come back to it. We need to think about your boundaries and that it’s ok to have them” I don’t think we need to come back to it. I don’t want to use my therapy session to trouble shoot this issue. It’s not a boundary issue that’s bothering me, I’m happy to set my boundaries with the birth parents and to check that out with my supervisor. It’s more about projecting how I felt onto how T feels. T asked me if I came to therapy today planning to say all this - “Was this what you wanted to talk about, or did it just come up?” I said it kind of just came up. T repeated that it was important and that it was about boundaries and about what the limits of my role are. After the session, I thought that my role with the birth parents is quite different to my therapist’s role with me. So maybe the way my feelings respond to their messages are different to how T feels in response to my messages.",felt,"I texted T that quote I posted yesterday and said omg it’s me. She replied “yes, it is you… but you’re learning that your feelings are valid now” I first came across the quote as I was looking something else up in the book, and it really reminded me of how things were with my parents over Christmas. My heart racing and my nervous system on overdrive yet looking calm on the outside. That is definitely a thing I learnt from necessity to do as a small child and have been doing ever since. It’s strange to think it’s not normal actually. Doesn’t everyone do that? I still find it quite a revelation to really realise that not everyone’s brain works the same way. Thoughts that naturally progress one to the next in my head might not be connected at all in someone else’s. We are all wired up quite differently.  Anyway, that’s probably an aside. I have known I have an avoidant attachment style ever since I started learning about attachment. But I’ve never really spoken about it so directly or in depth with T. She once commented that I was “quite avoidant” when it came up in conversation over something, but that’s about it. Of course it’s been referred to in the context of my responses to other things, but never really focused on. I guess T has it all written down in some formulation or whatever therapists do when they figure out the theory of what’s going on with their clients. I think it’s perhaps something to talk about a bit more next session,",ok,"Therapy 17/09/19  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can’t get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we’ll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn’t anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn’t say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter’s situation is completely separate to me.",talking,"We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said “I think I need to talk about something else now” which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I’m not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. “Shall I ask you some questions then?” she said, and I nodded. She carried on “Hmm… ok… children… holidays… the baby… what shall we go with?… oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I’ve hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there…. So, what’s happening with her future?” I started telling T about the plans for the baby’s future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by 7 minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I’ve had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we’ve talked about, but this week I don’t seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it’s a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits.",last,"Question: Hiya, I was interested in your advice- I have a therapist that I really like, but we just don’t see eye to eye on one particular issue. I’ve been feeling this way for ages but I’m too scared to bring it up in session. Now I’m not seeing her this week and naturally this problem is all I can think about. The worst part of me just wants to give up and run away and just ghost her but I feel like I should face the problem head on?? Would it be bad to text her about it now? Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don’t know what your therapists rules on texting are so I can’t know how she’d respond if you texted her. Also if it’s an issue that you know you don’t see eye to eye on, then it’s really best discussed in a therapy session rather than by text, so you don’t end up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you’ve been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next session? That way it puts it on the agenda but keeps the conversation for the therapy room. The fact that you’re thinking about it a lot this week probably means it’s an important topic for you to discuss. You could even talk around it in session for a while, saying you have something to talk about but you’re worried, you know don’t see eye to eye about it, you’re really scared to bring it up, it makes you just want to run away and not come to therapy anymore. That helps your therapist understand what an important thing it is for you.When I’ve approached stuff that way with my T, she reminds me that we’ve talked about hard stuff before, that she hasn’t got upset about certain topics, that she has been really happy that I’ve felt safe enough to bring these things up, proud that I’ve been brave enough to say them etc etc. That helps me build up the courage to bring up the difficult thing.Hope that helps anon x",maybe,"Therapy 23.02.21 // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week’s been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I’d been holding all week… and then I didn’t get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they’re falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn’t say that so I didn’t have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum’s facebook post and then I hadn’t had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn’t be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she’s saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It’s good to not get things wrong but it’s also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right??"

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
chickpea and eggplant ratatouille 
sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about 40 minutes with stirring every 5/10 minutes). that’s it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those 40 minutes just to thicken a  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

7,7,cup,"vanilla matcha cake 🍵🍰

ingredients

dry:

- 1.5 cups gluten free flour blend
- 1/2 cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
- 1 cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- 1/2 cup coconut yogurt (plain)
- 2 tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

- 1 cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 2 tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
- 2 tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to 350F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for 35-40 min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i’d say make the frosting and then remove 1/3 of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

* 1/3 cup vegan butter 
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cacao powder
* 2 tbsp oat flour

preheat oven to 350F and grease a brownie pan. in a microwave safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips with a tbsp of coconut oil in 30 second increments (i did two) until melted. in a mixing bowl, add the melted butter, eggs, and melted chocolate until smooth. add the remaining ingredients and mix until uniform. pour batter into the pan and bake for 22-25 minutes. remove from oven and let cool completely before adding the next layer.

salted caramel layer:

- 6-8 soft pitted dates
- 1/3 cup salted almond butter
- 2 tbsp water (can add more if needed to get the blender going)

add everything to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. i poured mine into a tupperware and placed it in the fridge to firm up for a few minutes while the brownies were cooling. once cooled, spread the caramel on top of the brownies and top with roasted salted peanuts. place in the fridge to set for a few minutes before slicing and enjoying!

Most of us have mastered certain poses that allow us to literally transform our bodies within seconds... Myself included. But this just goes to show that no matter how flawless we may look online, that’s just not the reality most of the time. Our lumps, bumps and rolls are normal and nothing to be ashamed of ⭐️

Happy Real Me Monday, except it’s also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren’t enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don’t is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn’t brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can’t possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they’re someone’s very best photo, they’re the highlight of someone else’s life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it’s close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That’s why it’s so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

As you guys already know, each week I post the posed, tensed, IG-worthy photos of myself beside the real, unposed, in-between snapshots! And this week we’ll still be doing that, but this time it’s going to be purely focused on showing you just HOW MUCH a lil bit of posing, tensing, good posture & bend of the body can change how our bodies look! 🤯

Swipe across to see a bunch of my IG VS REALITY photos showcasing my bloating, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks & loose skin — my body 90% of the time! 🙊

Which one of these 8 is your fav? Lmk in the comments, I’ll be replying to them all! 💛 Anyway, happy Monday my friends, I give you full permission to walk into this week with confidence & loving self-thoughts! 😏 I hope your week is just as AMAZING as you are! 🧚🏻‍♀️

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It’s from their new Eclipse collection & I’ve been living in it 😍 [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled 24/7 either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I’m so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know 💛

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <3

You can also be someone else’s “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled 24/7 either.

If you could create your own beauty standards... What would that look like? Hopefully it would look like the person you see when you look in the mirror and be everchanging as you grow older.

Cellulite, stretch marks, acne scars, arm flab, small curves, bloated bellies, hairy bodies, (the list goes on) aren’t imperfections... You aren’t flawed because of these things, you’re HUMAN & a worthy one at that! 

I see photos of supermodels on my Instagram explore page ALL. THE. TIME... Do I think they’re beautiful? Yes, they’re stunning! But do I think I’m less beautiful because of them? Not at all. We’re all built differently and made up of so many unique features, qualities & values that make us US. Embrace that! ✨

I’m sure we all have that friend who can’t see how beautiful they are, they make negative comments about their appearance around you and you just can’t understand how they don’t see how gorgeous they are, right?

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn’t mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there’s been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can’t expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

maybe you’ve struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here’s what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don’t have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don’t show up 100% for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can’t do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else’s emotions (whew! that’s a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

i am ending 2020 feeling the most me ME i think i’ve ever felt, and i don’t think i would’ve felt this way if it wasn’t for all the unexpected and challenging events and circumstances we were all forced to face this year.

the past couple years, i’ve made my main intention ~letting go~, and this year was the year i was truly able to feel the internal shifts happening within me.

one of the hardest parts about letting go for me was that it can take longer (sometimes a lot longer) to let go of thoughts than it is of actions. just because i had stopped harmful behaviors didn’t mean i wasn’t fighting an internal battle that in many ways felt even harder and more painful than the initial fight to change my actions.

not enough people tell you that the healing often hurts a lot more than the breaking,

but the journey to feeling whole again,

to feeling like YOU again is worth it.

happy new year’s eve ✨ cheers to releasing expectations for what next year has in store, cheers to healing, and cheers to becoming all that we are meant to be! 🥂",hard,"to the ones who are struggling,
the ones whose days have gone from
bad to worse,
the ones who feel like they lost everything
and don’t know what to do next,
~keep going~
because things change, time heals,
and forgiveness towards others and yourself can grow in the toughest times.
~keep going~
because you are learning and expanding.
you will be okay, promise,
and there will be a time when you look back at these moments and feel proud for making it through ✨

this picture was taken a year ago and behind my smile, i remember the struggles. when i am having a hard time, it’s so important for me to put things in perspective because even just one 1 year ago me never would’ve thought i could get to where i am at now",better,"social media: it’s the best and it can definitely be the worst 🙄 // I try to be as vulnerable and open as I can be on this account, but I can tell you that I definitely don’t share everything. In fact, I don’t share most things about my life. There are a ton of really low points that I never talk about as well as some really happy moments that I don’t share.  Even knowing that I only share a fraction of my own life on social media, I’m still human and sometimes get caught up in comparing myself to other people’s accounts.  Here’s a friendly reminder to stop comparing your behind the scenes to someone else’s highlight reel ⭐️",best,"we often get told to let go of the things that are no longer serving us, but we don’t talk enough about how hard it is to do that.

we are human. we form attachments. we seek safety. we crave familiarity. we have a hard time letting go, even if holding on is hurting us.

if you need to hear it: it’s okay if you are having a hard time letting go. it is not your fault if you are struggling. believe it or not, that harmful thing you are still holding to had a purpose- it helped you feel safe when life felt scary. i know it is SO hard to let go of that security blanket, but i also know that you can do it.

you are strong, you are capable, you are safe, and you deserve to be free 🕊🤍",world,"dear 16 year old me,

it’s okay that you don’t know who you are yet, this isn’t your forever, and one day, you’ll be able to genuinely say that you feel confident, at peace, hopeful, and free.

i’m proud of you. keep fighting.

love,
23 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they’re easier to deal with, and when good times come, they’re more fully enjoyed.

it’s moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i’ve come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

shoutout to everyone healing from things others don’t know about, making progress that no one recognizes, and fighting battles others may not understand.

i see you. I’m proud of you. keep going.",days,"it’s hard to feel good about yourself when somebody is mean to you all the time. don’t forget that you are somebody too. 

you know how someone can tell you that you’re smart, amazing, and beautiful 50 times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn’t really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you’re incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn’t feel right if i didn’t share about my hard days too. i’ve mentioned that i’ve been struggling a bit lately, and if i’m honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.

if you need to hear it: you don’t need to be your “best self” to be worthy and lovable. you are, have always been, and will always be enough.",okay,"sometimes, it feels like you can’t handle a single ounce more of pain and like you just can’t get through it. in times like those, i remind myself that i have persevered through every other struggle i’ve ever faced before, and behind the clouds that my head is trapped in, there IS sunlight, so i just need to keep going and let them pass ☁️

today, my best was fighting to get up, but still showing up for work, and that is enough. whatever darkness you might sometimes get lost in, remember that there IS light even if you can’t quite see it just yet ✨
so please,
keep going
show up for yourself
& know that your best is more than enough"
