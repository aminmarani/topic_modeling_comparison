0,0,#glutenfree,"hitting all my OG followers in their feels with this one 🥺 top five one of my favorite healthful recipes ever is this CHICKPEA EGGPLANT RATATOUILLE. it’s incredibly rich and flavorful, pairs perfectly with quiona/rice/potatoes, and i’ve found can be enjoyed both hot and cold! aka she can truly do it all ⚡️ if you’re looking for dinner under 40 minutes tonight, consider this your answer. i hope you love this as much as i do! ♥️
▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
chickpea and eggplant ratatouille 
sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about 40 minutes with stirring every 5/10 minutes). that’s it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those 40 minutes just to thicken a  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

weeknight vegan chili

1 chopped onion
3 stalks celery, diced
3 large carrots, diced
1 can pinto beans rinsed and drained
1 can black beans rinsed and drained
1 can cherry tomatoes 
2 cups water
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
sea salt
garlic powder

sauté the onion in a generous amount of olive oil and sea salt until soft and browned. then add celery and carrots and  cook for another few minutes until browned. add cherry tomatoes, pinto and black beans, balsamic vinegar, spices, and water. bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer, cooking for about 40 minutes with frequent stirring! if it reduces too much add more water and cook for a few minutes longer. this made three portions for me!

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott’s book ‘vegan one pot wonders’)

-1 cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for 2 hours
-1 onion, diced
-1 clove of garlic, minced
-1 cup each of diced carrots and celery
-1 bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
-2 cups water
-2 cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about 35 minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don’t stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it’s about 5 or 6 cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i’d say about 1 cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at 400F for 25 min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at 400F for 10 min)
- 1/2 cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- 1/4 cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
- 3 tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i’ve been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

",school,"Question: just curious how other countries work.. Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the “highlights” (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news. We probably hear more about US news than we hear about many other countries, but I’m sure there’s loads of US news that never makes its way onto the world headlines.On the BBC and ITV, which are our two main TV channels, there’s always a news programme at 10pm. This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a 24/7 news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don’t understand the American people a lot of the time. I know the election coverage has probably shown the worst of some groups but even outside that, in general we/they seem to have a different approach to life. Having said that, I’m sure the UK is horrifying to watch at times to others too.",family,"The steps to becoming a registered dietitian:

1- complete a bachelor’s (or master’s degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January 1, 2024, a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
2- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an “Internship.” some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete 1200 hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
3- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration’s registration exam
4- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. 46/50 of the United States require licensure to practice. 
5- maintain continuing education - 75 hours every 5 years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the “nutritionist” title isn’t regulated so there’s no guarantee of the experience and education that they’ve had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients —and to the world. good (i say this because i can’t blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

 me reading someone’s about and not seeing their race / ethnicity, then seeing a “longer about” link and click on that and STILL not seeing anything about their race or ethnicity 

 As someone who grew up with the internet, in the huge era of online safety campaigns, and the constant drilling in of not sharing your personal information online because it’s not safe. I will say this:

No one, not one single person, on the internet owes you their personal information.

What I share on my blog, is shared out of a choice, because that’s a decision I chose to make. Because I talk frequently on neurodivergence and sexuality, and I know I have followers who connect with that.

But I don’t owe people that information.

Strangers on the internet are never entitled to know:

Your name.
Your gender.
Your age.
Your date of birth.
Your location: City, State, Country, wherever. 
Your religion.
Your ethnicity (your culture, your nationality)
Your race (skin colour)
Your mental health.
Your physical health.
Your sexuality.

Your anything at all.

That information is personal. If you choose to share it, that’s your choice, but it is nobody elses right to have it, or demand it, or to manipulate it out of you.

If someone chooses not to share that. That is not some neferious plot. 

This is something important to understand, especially for young people on the internet. Kids in highschool. Your information is your own personal right. Keeping that safe, keeps you safe online. 

We’re in this very questionable internet scape where your information can be taken, and searched, and found. Where there are people who can dox you because they had access to basic information that lead them to deeper info. Where one bit of information can be used to make a smear campaign against you. Or used to target harrassment.

(This is also a really shady time where our information is being quietly sold through advertisers, and taken by data breeches, and DDOS attacks. Where there’s literal fuckin nazi’s on this site that tumblr doesn’t seem to care about because apparently breasts are worse?????)

This is why protecting your privacy and safety was such a huge campaign.

Everyone on the internet is a stranger. And yeah, imma cry ‘stranger danger’ here cause that’s what I grew up with, that’s what I was taught as computers became the big thing, and I was growing up on forums and chat messengers at a super young age where I was incredibly vulnerable. And i’m very lucky to have not encountered what some people I know did.

A/S/L was the most frequent question people would ask, and no it’s not american sign language. Age/Sex/Location. People wanted your info.

You do not need to share that information with anyone. 

There’s another good post on this topic here more focused on sharing age.

There’s a huge difference between sharing your interests and hobbies and fandoms and the general knowledge ‘trivia’ of yourself in an ‘about’ page, VS sharing the entirety of your personal information.

So if someone just has their name, age, and pronouns, but doesn’t list anything else beyond their music interests and fave bands. That’s not malicious, that’s not nefarious. That’s exercising a right to choose what you share.

They don’t owe anyone an indepth analysis of their gender. They don’t owe anyone the knowledge of where they live. They don’t need to reveal if they have a disability or not. They’re just 21 yr old Vera, who likes music and wants you to use they when refering to them.

Protect your information on the internet. 

Be safe on the internet.

And don’t let anyone pressure you, or guilt you, into sharing information you don’t want to share. 

 my personal fave from this sort of “Im checking your race to see if your allowed your opinion” shite is that what’ll happen is they’ll look, see I am Scottish and assume I am White and then proceed to lecture me about the demographic evils of my country and how we lack proper representation because media thing X…even though they felt confident enough to assume my race/ethnicity because they know Scotland is basically white as driven snow. 


 Basically get fucked op. 

 OP: “I’m in the right, dumb stupid white people.” 
 Also OP: has deleted the original post. Has replies turned off for the screen shot post. Has anon asks turned off.  

 Basically, OP needs to get off their high horse and just admit they think race is the most important thing about a person 

 @birthcharts seems kinda racist to me… 

 What if you talk a lot about your town and your sexuality, but are one of a few people of your race in said town and are in the closet publicly? If you keep your race a secret you can keep your anonymity AND speak freely on important local issues. If you drop that you are the sole colored gay in 300 miles suddenly your whole business is public.  - or we could just walk around with armbands so yall can have the fascist state that you really want.

 nonblack lesbians arent studs 

 Look at this. Read it. Then read it again.  

 Ok actually I’mma add something, as there are people confused in the tags about what this means. “Stud” (in the context of lesbianism) is a black identity identity akin to what butch would be considered. It’s a unique role and identity that originated from black lesbian communities (same as AG/aggressive(s) girls/stem/boi). There has been a problem with white lesbians in particular putting themselves in the stud tag and plastering their faces all other spaces/media made for STUDS (a specific group of GNC black lesbians). It’s really annoying and tiring because most of these white self pro claimed “studs” end up emulating masculine coded behaviour that is found in black (Specifically African American) culture, which literally makes y’all look like fools. Black identities and cultural mannerisms are not for your consumption or appropriation. 


 While I am aware that Black lesbians use this term, it really bugs me that various groups decide that a well-established word belongs to them exclusively.  The word “stud” has other definitions. It has been in use for a long time.  If you want to own a word, make up a new one.  Language can’t be pinned down and owned, not by anybody.  It changes.  It migrates.  It is like a living thing.  No group gets to say “That word belongs only to us.”  If tomorrow most people decided to use the word “kumquat” to mean lesbian?  Eventually we would be kumquats unless a counter-movement changed the usage.   I don’t use the term “stud” and personally am fine with my Black sisters using it.  But trying to own words is a losing proposition.  Sometimes they stick, but sometimes they squirm away and turn into something else.   Language is fluid.  Use it but don’t try to own it.",years,"Question: Do people ever not have to pay back their tuition? What are private schools like in the UK? Answer: Yes I think after 25 years if you’re still not earning a salary above the repayment threshold the tuition fees get written off. The logic is that it’s to be thought of as a sort of graduate tax and if your degree doesn’t result in you earning a higher salary, you don’t have to pay the tax.Private schools have smaller class sizes and generally have access to all sorts of extra facilities and opportunities because the parents are paying big sums of money for the privilege of sending their kids there. They often have expensive, distinctive, traditional and rather unique school uniform, quite often involving a blazer and a hat of some sort. Most people disagree with the concept that you can get a better education, higher grades and more opportunities just because you have more money, however many of us would love to send our kids to a private school for exactly those same reasons. We just can’t afford it.State schools (free and where the majority of kids are) are suffering greatly from lack of government funding and are having to shut down all sorts of extra-curricular activities and even some lesson options (bye bye art, music and drama) because they can’t fund them. They mostly have generic school uniform (or no uniform) that you can buy quite cheaply from supermarkets. However most kids in the UK go to these schools, have a good time and go on to do well in life.",social,"do you have to be a dietitian to learn nutrition or share nutrition information?

SHORT ANSWER: no, you can share anything you want on the internet

LONG(ER) ANSWER: no, but if educating others on proper nutrition basics is your main goal, you may want to consider getting a degree in nutrition and train/shadow dietitians in the field at the very least. i never knew how important dietitians were in the field until i became one lol. during the most stressful times in college i thought: “why not save time and money and get a certification in nutrition rather than a whole *ss degree?”

writing this, as a baby dietitian who still has a lot more to experience, i realize i’ve already learned so much valuable information. not only have i learned/trained for acute medical conditions, but also the aftercare. also the fact that not everyone has the access nor nutrition education the same way most of us (using our smartphones) have. the hours of science & nutrition therapy classes helped me understand electrolyte imbalances, feeding for those in serious conditions, etc. it’s always fun to make meal plans and prescribe “green smoothies” but that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what dietitians do. there’s also the fact that dietitians can bill for insurance and legally work with a medical care team, which is important to some

nutrition information on the internet is rampant with inaccurate claims, harmful methods, and more. it’s also filled with so much helpful, healing nutritional advice. just be thorough in your own research and what you actually apply to your own life🥰

2,2,therapy,"Therapy 21.07.20 // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn’t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she’d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don’t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we’ve been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don’t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don’t say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that’s exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that’s likely what I’m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I’m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It’s what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I’m not ready to go there. “No! I’m just telling you that if you’re waiting for me to do it, I probably won’t.” “What I’m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we’ll have year from then to process our ending. I’m thinking we’ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you’ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that’s all very well, but I hope she knows I’m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can’t believe I’ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven’t really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I’m just not ready to be without her.",session,"Therapy 3.11.20 // struggling to speak   I’m struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I’d written down. But although they’d felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don’t think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn’t get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren’t really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn’t find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were ‘generational’, did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn’t believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn’t feel like it did. I said that I don’t feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I’m not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don’t need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we’d got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I’d believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after 3 years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it’s not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it’s like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.",therapist,"Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don’t like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don’t know why when she brings it up, it’s always at the end of a session. It’s risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn’t want to push aside the stuff I’m bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I’d been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn’t said it out loud to anyone. I’ve started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of 2019, the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I’m trying to say something but it’s hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I’d been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I’ve said it out loud, I don’t want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that’s something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don’t want to stop therapy. I don’t want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don’t want it.",bit,"Therapy 14.04.20 // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I’m about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there’s an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I’m just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn’t remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn’t the same supervisor as the one that didn’t like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for 6 years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That’s because I’d perfected my blank face because I’d learnt it as a child that it wasn’t safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.",talk,"Therapy 19.11.19 // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I’d had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is 2.5 years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and ‘wrong’ some bits of it were, and the next minute I’m thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I’m just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don’t seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn’t really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn’t connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I’m just giving you a warning that we’ve got about 5 minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about 4 minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what’s the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they’re not staying with you?” “They know I’m talking about them in therapy and they don’t like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that’s magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don’t know, it’s just what I think! Why else wouldn’t they come? They’ve always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they’ve suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn’t feel like we’d achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we’d been talking about the week before.",felt,"Therapy 23.02.21 // is this part 3? I’ve lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she’d noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. “When you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you’ve had enough of me talking about my childhood.” T said that she wasn’t saying any of that at all. She doesn’t think we’re going round in circles and if we’re spiralling around something, it’s that we’re going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn’t coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of ‘Faith is quite happy with this’, and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it’s time. I nodded ruefully. It’s ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now 9 years later I’m still here and don’t want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. “You look like you’re about to say something” T commented. “I’m deliberating whether to say it or not” I said, pulling a face. “Go on then, let’s just say it”  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I’d done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I’d done another thing since then and I said no. T said “ok, sooo… it was a blip”. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn’t do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I’m going to go easy on myself over it.",talking,"Texting my therapist debate  A dilemma that rears its head when I’m in a bit of minor crisis is whether to text my therapist. I have two opposing arguments in my head: 1. Sooner or later, I will end therapy and then I won’t have T available to help emotionally regulate me when I need it, so I should learn to get through it on my own without needing to message T  2. Sooner or later, I will end therapy and then I won’t have T available to help emotionally regulate me when I need it, so I should make use of her availability as long as I have her in order to take in as much as I can from her. Then when I no longer have her, I will have a good stash of internalised “words from T” to help me through. On Wednesday after I’d got back from my traumatic hospital visit with d3 and her poorly ears, I was a right mess. On the adrenaline comedown from standing my ground against the doctors. I don’t do confrontation so it costs me a lot emotionally. I was sitting on the kitchen floor crying with the overwhelm of it all, and just wanting some soothing reassuring words from T, but having the above debate back and forth in my head. Eventually I messaged T “Can I text you about something or should I try and be ok on my own” T replied “I know you only text when you feel you can’t work it out on your own, so maybe text me but add what you think my answer might be. Would that work?” It sounded a good plan in theory but in reality I then sent her a long text which made sense to me but probably wasn’t hugely clear to her, and I was in a bit much of a state to think what she would say in reply. She replied anyway and said well done and that I had built some more positive neural pathways in being able to stand my ground. Just having that bit of communication with her helped. I might talk next session about the debate I have within myself about texting her though. Find out what is the right thing to do.",maybe,"Therapy 16.02.21 // part one // and freeeeze…..  I can’t remember now how T introduced the subject. Usually she asks me “So, where to today?” or something similar. Today I think she said something like “I wanted to ask you a question” or “Can I ask you something?”. Anytime she says something like that, I immediately feel anxious. Something slightly out of the ordinary puts me on high alert. I nodded though that she could ask me, so she said “How do you feel therapy is going?”  She must have seen the look of fear that crossed my face, because she immediately followed up with “That’s not a trick question. I’m not expecting any particular answer” and several other reassuring phrases. Then she said that she did have a few thoughts on it herself, but she would tell me them in a minute. I thought she might be referring to what I’d said last week, when I said I felt like therapy was running away with me and I keep not getting round to finishing talking about a subject before something else took over. I repeated those thoughts, and then T started to tell me what she’d obviously been waiting to say but couldn’t until she’d done this sort of fake lead-in. It feels fake because I think she was only asking my thoughts so she could then tell me her thoughts. I’m not sure she really listened to my answer. Then she said that she had been thinking about therapy, and about how it was progressing, and where it was going. Very quickly, she added “I’m not talking about us ending, I’m not saying I think we should end. But I know you have brought the subject of ending up once or twice, so I know it’s there in the back of your mind too.” I’m looking at her very suspiciously by this point, sitting very still with one hand curled up in front of my mouth.  She continued “When you started therapy, it was like I had to take you by the hand and lead you, like a small child. Then gradually you grew, so it was like we were walking along side by side, like you were a teenager or young adult. And now it feels like you have grown more and you are going ahead of me, and I need to step back and let you lead the way.” She finished speaking and I just sat, frozen, with my hand up over my mouth. I sat like that for what felt like a long time, and T sat in silence with me. Maybe she had asked me my thoughts on it when she’d finished speaking, I can’t remember. I’d gone off into freeze mode. My brain heard her talk about endings and growing up and leading the way, and I hate it. I hate it all. I don’t want it. I want to just carry on as we are doing. What’s wrong with how it is? It’s just fine. Just stop saying all this stuff.",last,"Therapy 10.11.19 // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I’m just letting you know I’m going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can’t even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It’s like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it’s just agreeing the usual time and day, it’s a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I’m sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.",end,"Therapy 02.06.20 // emotional intelligence  After we’d talked about retraining my brain for 30 minutes (instead of the 5 minutes I’d planned!), there was only time to bring up one of my two remaining topics. I pushed “faulty thought patterns” on to next week - it’s been pushed on so many times now anyway. And part of me doesn’t want to jump into it at all anyway. I explained how I’d been thinking about therapy from the week before and it suddenly occurred to me how differently my mum and I see my children’s relationship with my dad. My mum pushes them towards him, whereas I try and keep them away from him. My mum seems to think that she can create a relationship by pushing them into proximity with each other, whereas I am trying to prevent their relationship being destroyed, by keeping them away from each other. Not only that, but I feel physically very anxious when any of my girls are one on one with my dad. It’s more a trigger from my own childhood but some of it is also based in current reality. Sometimes I even have to leave the room because it stirs up so much anxiety in me that I can’t bear to sit there and watch it play out.  My mum is oblivious to how much anxiety my dad generates in me. T said “Your parents aren’t emotionally intelligent. They couldn’t or wouldn’t understand how you felt as a child. They couldn’t imagine what was going on inside you. But you are emotionally intelligent. You are doing things differently. You think about how your girls are feeling and you respond to that.” I usually agree with my mum on everything so it’s strange to think about this stark difference in how we behave. I said “It’s hard to think of my mum as having got something wrong” “But Faith, you do know she got things wrong, because you have chosen to be intentional about parenting differently. We’ve spoken about that.” I sighed and nodded. T is right. It’s just uncomfortable to have to face it again."

  Eating healthy foods with good nutrients is especially important when you’re restricting and fasting. Processed foods and fast food are missing key nutrients your body needs to function properly.  Take your vitamins and drink your water.  
 
",eat,ana-in-my-headd:  The thing about me is that if I’m not hungry and my body doesn’t need any food my brain goes “eat eat eat eat eat” and if I’m starving and my body is asking for nutrients my brain goes “don’t eat don’t eat don’t eat don’t eat don’t eat”,weight,"You don’t just choose recovery one time and then are automically better. You don’t just decide to get better and all of your recovery is completely linear with no setbacks. You have to choose recovery every single day, often several times a day. Whenever you feel the urge to over exercise, the need to skip or put off a meal, whenever want to look up “low calorie x”, count calories, obsessively check your weight, swap a food you genuinely want for a “healthier” alternative, you are faced with a decision. You can either follow the rules set by your ED, or you can choose recovery. You can choose freedom. Recovery isn’t easy, and it takes time. Setbacks are going to happen, but you much more likely to get back on track if you know that they’re inevitable. By being ready and equipped to deal with triggers and/or setbacks, you are making it easier for yourself to choose recovery.",recovery,"mentalhealthmartini: 

 pros of having a basic understanding of the digestive process: not scared of fat in my food cons of having a basic understanding of the digestive process: scared of everything equally",body,"Okay so, it’s a new day, time to start fresh after my binging ramping tf up. Here’s my plan: I’ve hit a plateau and my binging has become more frequent in the past 2~ months. Of course quarantine has made it harder for me to lose weight as Im not going to school but I’ve had differences in my eating generally, if I focus on these I should get back on track 1- Healthy eating: I haven’t been focusing on eating well as of late. Im pretty certain this has linked to my binges/higher eating as there are more foods I’m willing to eat (yet still eat low amounts of my fear foods which are healthy rip) and also not eating healthy makes me overall feel trashier 2- Sugar (links to healthy eating): I’ve stopped my complete ban on sugar and although I was able to keep it low I’ve slipped recently. It’s not as filling and does not give me the satisfaction/contentness of non sugary foods (then there is the fact I always crave savory after a sweet food so more urges) 3- Snacking: Why did I ever think buying snack foods was a good idea? These aren’t candy and some are even healthy but still, I now have access to food that I can instantly eat with no prep. It just adds so easily to my intake, sticking to mainly meals is better for me as it’s harder to binge on entire meals the same way it is to binge on many snacks Im going to focus on them three and do some other stuff to get myself in line (which I won’t mention as those are purely ed behaviors, I listed these as they are genuinely good for healthier eating and prevent binges can be detrimental to emotional and physical healthy, I’m serious about not being pro-ana or pro-ed)",disorder,"heavyweightheart: 

 not all eating disorders involve intention to restrict food or lose weight; not all eating disorders involve body image disturbances or body size preoccupation. not all eating disorders start with intentional restriction or weight loss, and many of them never involve these things.  anorexia nervosa can start with a flu bug. arfid is simply a phobic or aversive response to food. so-called “binge eating” disorder can start with being underfed as a kid.  eating disorders are at base about food avoidance and energy deficiency, and not for any one reason, or sometimes for any conscious reason at all. diet culture and fatphobia certainly inform the majority of eating disorders, so these threads of our socialization get inextricably bound up in the biological dynamics of the disorder. but if we continue to push only narratives about the desire to be thin, or for “control,” or diets taken to the extreme, we miss a significant segment of our population.",healthy,"Today was a good day I ate a proper lunch and a proper dinner without worrying about calories or health or such too much and I feel good! I wasn’t grumpy. Mealtimes weren’t hard, I didn’t overthink my food. I didn’t even exercise to make up for any of it, and I’m still gonna have an evening snack later :)",calories,"When others eat one meal a day it’s a “diet” with “health benefits,” but when I eat one meal a day it’s an “eating disorder” and “dangerous.”",foods,"Two things to remember  1. Feeling full may mean I weigh more in that moment but that doesn’t mean I’ve gained fat. It just means there’s food in my stomach. 2. If it takes approximately 3500 extra calories to gain a pound in weight, then eating a piece of cake containing about 300 calories is not going to make me gain two pounds, despite what my brain tells me."

LMAO NOBODY TRUSTS U,literally,sometimes i think i want a little me because the thought of having a tiny friend who will always be there to love u is nice but then i remember that theres no guarantee your kids will love you or even like you and youre still alone regardless bc one day the kid will leave u and i guess thats ok because im not mentally stable enough to be a mom ever anyways and the cons of children outweigh the pros.. i jist really wish i had someone on this planet that i could give love to and talk to that admires me and loves me despite all my faults. i wish i had someone i could go just be around without annoying them or being judged. even if they are just a dumb little kid. someone the accepts me and loves me for who i am to them. but ill never have that. all ill ever have is myself and i hate myselfs so idk how this is supposed to work,ass,💸💰💵💳💰 reblog to manifest money dollars only works if you put intention into it put ALL UR INTENTION INTO IT collectively this post will summon enough intention to manifest all them money dollars 💰💳💵💰💸,someone,"Whatever youve been procrastinating or putting off during this quarantine Maybe take the time to do it today? Ive been avoiding the task of sanding a big wood frame to use for an art piece.

Its an absolute chore to sand it down by hand.But i should really just do it..Heres the big mirror (my mug for scale). I found it outside someones home before neighborhood pick up.

7,7,days,Day 8 of inpatient was weird. I woke up early and felt really energized and I was super productive. I felt good for most of the day but there was always the thought at the back of my head that the good feeling wasn’t going to last and that I would eventually crash and burn. I managed to make it through most of the day feeling okay but it hit me hard at night. I felt the worst that I’ve felt since I’ve been here and it was really hard. I was barely moving or communicating with the staff and it was overall not a good situation. I agreed to take a PRN after a lot of encouragement and I feel a little better now. I’m mostly just tired. They wouldn’t let me go to my room because they didn’t think I was safe enough so they kept me in open areas. The meds they gave me are kicking in and I am super tired. Hopefully I’ll feel more stable and regulated tomorrow.,home,Day 33 of inpatient was okay. I didn’t sleep well last night so I took several naps throughout the day. I started tms today and that was interesting. It feels kinda weird and I got a headache after but it wasn’t as bad as the headaches I got after ect. I ran into two friends who had been discharged but had appointments on campus and that was really nice. My two closest friends are leaving tomorrow and I’m sad about that. We’ve spent basically all day together for more than a month and we’ve gotten super close. I’m gonna miss them. It’s hard to see everyone leave while I’m still stuck here.,last,Day 91 was pretty eventful. I woke up early because I didn’t sleep well the night before. I went back to bed shortly after. I was kinda out of it for most of the day but I was able to get some drawing done. The afternoon was really hard for me and I ended up self harming pretty badly. I got sent to the ER to get checked out and I’ll hopefully be back to the unit soon.,work,Day 11 of inpatient was weird. It started out really bad because I didn’t sleep well last night. I was supposed to wake up early and stay out of my room today but that didn’t happen. The day sort of got better but it also felt like I was dreaming the entire time. My friends visited and it was nice but I few like I wasn’t really present for it at all. My mood wasn’t great today but it wasn’t too bad. I mostly felt numb and empty and I don’t know if that’s better or worse than the usual depressed mood. Oh well.,feeling,Day 36 of inpatient was okay. I didn’t sleep well last night (as usual). I went to a couple groups but didn’t really like them. My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I’ve basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I’m just so tired all the time and I don’t want to be awake.,night,Day 31 of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I’m sad but also happy for her.,morning,Day 46 of inpatient was mostly good. I spent time with friends in the morning and then went to tms. I took a nap after tms and then went to some groups. I found out that my friend is leaving tomorrow and I’m sad. My anxiety is really bad right now and I’m not doing well. The rest of the day was good though. My doctor told me that I will be here for a long time and that’s a bummer. It hasn’t really hit me yet.,better,Day 27 of inpatient was boring. I woke up early and couldn’t fall back asleep. I watched some tv and then went back to sleep. Then I spent some time with friends and went on a walk. Then I went back to sleep. I slept through most of today so I guess my mood was okay. I’m still really sad about my favorite nurse leaving.,getting,Days 93 and 94 of inpatient were okay. Day 93 wasn’t very good. I had an okay day but still slept for most of the day shift. The evening was hard and I self harmed again. I’ve been feeling pretty shitty physically in addition to mentally because of the whole concussion situation. Day 94 was better. I spent time with friends for most of the day. The weather was nice so the walks were fun. I got to see my dogs.,okay,"Day 61 of inpatient was kind of weird but not necessarily in a bad way. I didn’t sleep well so I was up early. We didn’t have anything scheduled in the morning so I did my laundry, cleaned my room, changed my sheets, and hung up pictures and posters. It was a very productive morning but I was also really anxious. I had a doctor’s appointment outside of the hospital so I got to go on pass for that. It was weird being off the unit and around so many people. I’ve been really anxious lately and I don’t know why."

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you’re excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you’re doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you’re doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that’s not actually true for me right now”
❌”i’m not in abundance right now”
❌”I can’t do that”

9,9,body,"Happy Real Me Monday ✨ DRESSING ROOM ✨ edition

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it’s all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn’t reflect the reality of the situation.

1. We are all our own harshest critics & 2. Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide 2 is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you’ve experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we’ll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the 1% of someone’s life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

#dontcompare #instagramvsreality #expectationvsreality #selfesteem #fittingroom #selfesteemboost #femaleempowerment #allbodiesaregoodbodies #selfconfidence #aphrodite #bodyimagemovement #iamenough #bodyimage #feelgood #positivemind #thisisnormal #bekindtoyourself #bekindtoyourmind",look,"Lately I’ve noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I’ve seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can’t believe a young woman’s body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else’s body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can’t possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they’re human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I’m leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn’t always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We’re all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society’s standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I’d rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here’s to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you’re absolutely bangin’!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

Happy Real Me Monday ✨ FITTING ROOM ✨ edition ⤵️

A “bad body image day” can be triggered by many things… Sometimes it’s seeing yourself in the mirror, sometimes it’s sizing up or down in clothes, sometimes it’s comparing yourself to others... Just to name a few. 

But a lot of the time, what you see doesn’t reflect the reality of the situation. Whether that’s in the mirror, trying on clothes or seeing photos online.

1. We are all our own harshest critics 
2. You’ve only ever seen yourself in the mirror or in photos, so you will never actually see your true beauty. 
3. Lighting, angles, posing, different lenses & mirrors can change the way we look — especially in fitting rooms. Some stores use mirror manipulation or softer lighting to hide lumps & bumps. Some stores use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... But in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!
4. Sizing differs so much 😅 I size up & down depending on the store or fit! 🤯 (P.s. sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you’ve experienced any of this before!

You are not your size. You are not your appearance. There is so much more to you than that 💗

Remember, a bad body image MOMENT doesn’t have to turn into a bad body image DAY. Acknowledge the way you’re speaking to yourself, take a deep breath & consciously try to switch to more gentle thoughts!!

Please be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

P.s. for those asking, my hair was done recently by @_edwardsandco — we went a lil bit darker & I’m loving it!! 🫶

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we’ve been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don’t have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven’t done our hair, makeup, we’re feeling super bloated, etc. That isn’t a bad thing. That doesn’t make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn’t live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don’t owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they’re all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don’t let your mind (or anyone else’s) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn’t compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark — it’s coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio 😍

Trust me, it’s like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you’re hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there’s actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you’ve followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn’t your lack & that maybe, you’re only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they’re scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the 1st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I’m flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I’ve STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it’s hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would’ve worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

It’s VERY likely they:

🦵 have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, smaller waist etc)
🦴 have a different bone structure 
🧬 have a different genetic makeup
🏋🏻‍♀️ lead different lifestyles which can lead to a completely different body composition 
🤳🏻 post posed & perfected photos for social media (like these examples above)
📱 possibly even edit their photos before posting, etc
🙅‍♀️ their body might’ve been achieved by doing things that you simply can’t sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self 
🤷🏻‍♀️ OR maybe they did achieve it in a healthy way, but those same habits may not = the same body for you or be sustainable for you.

Either way, you will NEVER be content in your skin UNTIL you stop giving your inner critic all the power & start actively trying to be gentler with yourself. You are not in competition with anyone else, you’re in your own lane, one of a kind, and it’s not fair to compare your behind-the-scenes self to someone else’s highlight reel. I hope reminders like these slowly chip away & help you with all of that! 🙏🏼 

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren’t yours? 👀 Leave a “❤️‍🩹” if you do & a “❤️‍🔥” if you don’t. Let’s be honest besties.

Your best body is the one you have when you’re looking after yourself both mentally & physically, when you’re living a balanced life tailored to your physical AND mental well-being. However that “looks” on you is the least important part 💛

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <3

You can also be someone else’s “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled 24/7 either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

More than 200 MILLION when you search “how to get rid of loose skin”
More than 19 million for “how to get rid of stretch marks”
More than 5 million for “how to get rid of cellulite”
More than 3 million for “how to get rid of hip dips”
The list goes on. [ad]

It’s ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. Do you have to LOVE them? No of course not, but these features are human.

Let’s approach them one by one…

Belly fat: a layer of fat is vital for a healthy, functioning, fertile body. It’s essential that the human body has some, you would not function without it. It serves to absorb vitamins, store energy, protect & insulate your body. 

Loose skin: is due to your skin stretching at some point… It will likely tighten up again slowly over time depending on how much you have. It’s not something to be ashamed of, it’s something to be in awe of!

Stretch marks: AKA a beautiful purple/pink scar that shows you how much you’ve grown. Almost everyone will have stretch marks at least once in their lives as we all go through a growth spurt from child to adult.

Cellulite: more women have cellulite because the structure of our connective tissue is different to men, which causes our skin to dimple where theirs doesn’t (as much).

Hip dips: the appearance of hip dips is due to your BONE structure & the shape of your pelvis. If all of us could see our skeletons, we would see an indentation where the hip bone meets the top of the thigh.

(Even those who appear to not have any of them, most likely do!!)

Here’s a proud video of mine, along with showing you how easy it can be to “hide” these things online which is why we don’t see them very often, but I promise you are definitely not the only one with them 🌟

The more we see it, the more we normalise it 🥰

Happy Real Me Monday, except it’s also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren’t enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don’t is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn’t brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can’t possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they’re someone’s very best photo, they’re the highlight of someone else’s life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it’s close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That’s why it’s so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Read this before you set someone else’s body as your “body goals” 😬

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren’t yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else’s sets you up for failure… 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it’s VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don’t share what they look like 24/7 so you likely only see them at their “best”
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don’t show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might’ve been achieved by doing things that you simply can’t sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don’t look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you’re living in when you’re living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It’s really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn’t always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying “You are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were” so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it’s what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would’ve helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today 🦋

Happy Real Me Monday! 💐

To me, romanticising your life isn’t looking for the perfect moments in your life, it’s about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little moments. It’s about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Be intentional.
Be thoughtful.
Be there for yourself.

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It’s necessary. It’s empowering. FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

And by alone time, I don’t mean scrolling through social media or watching a TV show, I mean making the time to be present, soak up your life & do what brings you joy.

Welcome to my 6th ✨SOLO DATE DIARY✨ entry 📖 

To me, romanticising your life isn’t looking for the perfect moments in your life, it’s about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little mundane moments. Being present in the ups & downs. It’s about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I, myself, am extremely guilty of this… But I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Before dating myself, I had no idea I could be confident enough to go to an arcade on my own, dine in alone, sit by myself & get lost in a book with the hustle & bustle of life all around me.

I had no idea I could be alone without feeling lonely.

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It’s necessary. It’s empowering. I’m sure we’ve all heard the saying “you can’t pour from an empty cup” & it’s true. I urge you to prioritise yourself… FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

The greatest & longest relationship you’ll have is with yourself. Invest in it. Put in the effort to let it grow. Make it a happy one. You yourself, as much as anyone else in the universe, deserves your love & affection 💫

This was the absolute cutest solo date I’ve been on to date 🥲 the kangaroos, the owls, the emu cuddling, the koalas plonking on each other’s heads 😂 & the baby bats at the end (!!!!!) 🦇 ahhh it was all too much. I hope this video brings you as much happiness as this day brought me!

🌟 SOLO DATE DIARY #5 🌟 

The reason I started taking myself on these solo date adventures is because I’d always lacked confidence. I was the 18-year-old without a license or job, relying on my mum to make doctor’s appointments for me because I was too afraid to make a phone call. But I knew that version of me was being held back by my fears… So now, at 25, I’ve decided to start dating myself. It was my way of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into situations I’d usually avoid, to prove that 1. I can enjoy my own company and 2. I WILL grow into my happiest, most confident self 🤝

Remember, the person you want to be is already within you, otherwise you wouldn’t want to be that person. The person I AM is confident, kind, spontaneous, motivated, compassionate, isn’t afraid to order what she actually wants to eat off the menu, makes friends with strangers, doesn’t care what people “might be thinking of her”, she can handle awkwardness & she’s proud of who she is! 💪🏼 

In the past I’ve taken myself to a theme park, the cinema, the arcade, random cafes, the beach, sunrises on the lake, the library & so on… Ahhh, there’s so much fun to be had in your own company 🤩 would anyone want SOLO DATE DIARIES to become a thing where I take you along each time? Leave a “👏🏻👏🏻” if so!

Let’s get to know each other… Introduce yourself! 🥰 Who are you? Where are you from? What do you love? & Where would you take yourself on a solo date? Lmk below! 💛

So many people ask me why I take myself on dates. 
""Don't you feel lonely?"" 
""Don't you wish you were experiencing this with friends?""
""Why don’t you go with Dylan instead of solo?"" 

The truth is, I absolutely adore my dates with Dylan and hanging out with my friends and connecting with others... BUT...

I used to rely on other people to have fun & live life. Now… I don’t 🤭

Like this song says, I take myself on dates to get to know ME better. Taking some intentional time for myself is better for my health / confidence / independence / the list goes on! 

The perfect date to me includes sunshine, a cute outfit like this dress from @showpo (code: BREE15), adventure, good books, cute furry friends, moments of gratitude, the sunset & a picnic 🍉🍓🌻 so that's what I did! What’s the “perfect date” include for you? 🫶

I usually never post camera roll dumps like this because I tell myself they don’t add value to y’all, BUT… you can’t watch these lil snippets & tell me it didn’t heal something deep within your soul 🥹 there’s something so therapeutic about being outside of your own head & simply being present with nature, animals, movement, organising your space, etc. these are just a few things that have made my mind a nicer place to be lately & I hope it reminds you to make time for the things that make your mind a nicer place to be too 💗

Gone are the days we feel bad for not having a Valentine… Be your own valentine!!! I mean, seriously WHAT A CATCH 😍 I’ve said it before & I’ll say it 10000 times more, solo dates are the perfect way to reconnect with yourself, do more of the things that fill YOUR cup & give some love & energy back to yourself, you deserve it 💗

My love language is (all of them but mainly) quality time & words of affirmation, so I’ve created a full day servicing those things 🫶

1st: find the empowered boss lady style I’m aiming for & then go recreate it with my own wardrobe
2nd: pick/buy myself flowers
3rd: create a romantic lil choc strawberry platter
4th: get changed into a spicy outfit once I’m back at home
5th: write myself a love letter 💌 
6th: watch a classic romance movie with my roses set up, my chocolate-dipped strawbz & a spicy lil outfit from @loungeunderwear that made me feel soooo confident!

Because as long as you have someone like Dylan in your life, you’ll have an abundance of joy 💙",best,"7 years ago I bumped into a stranger in a McDonald’s carpark & that stranger ended up becoming my whole world 🥺🌎

Isn’t it amazing how one chance meeting can change your life forever?

Dylan was the first person to ever ask me out on a date. After our first date, we became inseparable, going on dates every 2nd night. Every time, Dylan would make me feel like the QUEEN HERSELF & be a complete gentleman. One time we got in the car & followed the road to a random destination. We beach-hopped & camped in the back of his car, staying up all night long getting lost in one of the realest & deepest conversations I’d ever had…

It’s been 7 years since then & Dylan still goes out of his way every day. There’s never a moment in time where I question his love. As I post this, Dylan & I are cuddled up together in a one-man tent overlooking the stars, which is exactly the type of spontaneous mid-week adventure we would’ve signed up for 7 years ago 😂👏🏻

Dylan, one of the MANY reasons I admire you is because you strongly believe life is about GIVING, not getting. It’s always “How can we give to others, to nature, to wildlife, to the world & to ourselves?” And because we’re both so aligned with our calling to give & empower others, it’s something we naturally do for each other. “How can we give to each other today? How can I make you smile, cheer you on, be there for you, show you that I appreciate you?” I believe this is one of the reasons we’ve been able to nurture what we have for the past 7 years.

I’m constantly in awe of your zest for life, your heart, wit, brilliant mind, positivity, patience & ability to communicate so openly. I will never be able to accurately describe the true marvel of your mind, how gentle your heart is or how absolutely magnetic your energy is.

I am so grateful it’s me who has your heart, because I will never take that for granted.

I love you so much. Thank you for making life exciting & for flirting with me like we’ve only just met. In you I’ve found my equal, my closest friend, life’s greatest joy & the purest love. I’m so blessed to share this life with you 🤍

P.s. Dylan’s anniversary post on his brand new IG @withdylangrae made me cry 🥲",reminder,"Disclaimer: this voiceover just gets more chaotic because I recorded it while walking up a hill so pls excuse how out of breath I am HAHA 😅👇

“There’s a whole new world waiting for you outside of your comfort zone” ~ quoted from a sign I read while on this solo date!! 🌎🤝🦋 

For me, before my first ever solo date, I really wanted to go to the cinemas on my own. It seemed so weird to me before I did it, because whenever I saw someone at the movies on their own I felt sad for them, and the idea of going up to the register on my own & asking for 1 ticket seemed terrifying, but it’s empowering as heck & has become my new norm!! I promise, as daunting as it may seem at first, a small step outside your comfort zone = huge growth with your confidence!! 🙌

If I never took the leap to take myself on my first ever solo date, I doubt I’d have the confidence I have today to book a spontaneous night away on my own at the Sunshine Coast (2 hours away from home)… and then wake up the next day for a bike ride along the river… and then make my way to the markets… I’ve introduced myself to a whole new world & so many happy memories that are yet to be made 🥲

There were so many times I’d wanted to go to a themepark or a cafe or to the movies, but everyone else was too busy, so I just didn’t go. Those are the things I feel comfortable to do now, with others or just by myself. 

I learn so much about myself every time I take myself on a date… I check in with myself, go at my own pace, I learn about new things I enjoy or things I don’t like, I soak up the moments more, I feel more present… and don’t get me wrong, spending time with others is so special (it’s my fav), there’s no denying that, but when was the last time you made the effort to be intentional in your own company? It’s something I never did before, but it’s something I really love doing now. 

Tell me, what’s something you wish you could do on your own? A place you really want to go? Or simply something you’d love to experience, but everyone else is too busy or it seems too confronting right now?

- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend
- 1/2 cup almond flour

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to 350F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you’d like (i used 1 cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for 35-40 min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted 1 cup of chocolate chunks with 1 heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave (2 increments of 30 seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it’s so dreamy!

* 1 and 1/2 cup gluten free flour
* pinch of baking powder
* pinch of sea salt
* 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk
* 3/4 cup coconut sugar
* splash of vanilla extract
* chocolate chunks/chips of choice

directions:

heat the oven to 350F and grease a cookie sheet. in a small bowl, mix the melted butter and cacao powder until smooth and uniform. in a separate bowl, mix the egg and egg yolk with the coconut sugar and vanilla. stir in the melted butter/cacao mixture and set aside. in another bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder and salt. add the wet mixture to the dry by folding until well combined. stir through chocolate (i like using chopped chocolate for cookies because it melts and spreads). drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and top each cookie with more chocolate if desired. bake for 10-12 minutes and let cool completely before enjoying!

turns out all i had to do was increase the chocolate to caramel ratio? who knew? 🤯

double chocolate vegan twix bars

crust:

- 2/3 cup oats
- 1 cup soaked raw cashews
- 3 tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil 
- 4 tbsp maple syrup 
- 3 tbsp cacao powder

date caramel layer: 
- 4 tbsp creamy salted peanut butter (can also use creamy salted almond butter)
- 8-10 medium soft dates, pitted
- splash of vanilla
- sea salt
- cinnamon
- 1 or 2 tbsp of warm water if you want this runnier!

chocolate layer: 
- 1 chocolate bar of choice, chopped
- 1 tbsp peanut butter 

directions:

add all of the crust ingredients in a blender and blender until uniform. transfer to a brownie pan (i used a small tupperware) and form into a solid layer. place in the fridge to set for five minutes. while that’s setting, make the date caramel layer by adding all of those ingredients to the blender (rinsed after making the crust) and blend until smooth/uniform. transfer the caramel onto the crust layer and place back in the fridge to set for a few minutes. melt the chocolate and peanut butter (i use the microwave in two 30 second increments, stirring in between). once smooth, pour over the caramel, spread evenly, and place in the fridge for set for at least 2 hours. remove, let thaw for a few minutes, slice, and store in the fridge!

12,12,guys,"Vlogmas week one round-up 🎄⛅️❄️🏃🏻‍♀️✨
-
Film, edit, upload, repeat . . . until Christmas 🤓😏🙃 It’s a biiiiiig big commitment, but I honestly love the challenge of creating new videos every day that are fun, meaningful and just bit of a laugh at the end of the day 🙌🏻
-
From the biology of smear tests to being thrown under the bus by @veganmutti (😭😅), I hope you’re enjoying the videos so far if you’re following along! Episode 7 today (because I did start late), is all about adult friendships and what this looks like to me 🫶🏻
-
Last year I feel like I learnt where I went wrong, and lost a bit of momentum at times, but this year I hope to hit my goal of not missing an upload . . . so I guess we’ll just have to see how that goes 🙈👀
-
It’s getting super cold in the UK right now, my butt cheeks literally freeze on my runs lol, but I hope you guys are all enjoying December so far!!! 💚
-
#vlogmas #hollydays",video,"I ran the LONDON MARATHON 2021 like whattttttt ✅😭🇬🇧🏃🏻‍♀️
-
Just a casual 26.2 miles later and you guys, I’m officially a marathoner 🥺 I honestly cannot believe I crossed the finish line in 3 hours 37 minutes 😱🙈 I said at the very start of my training that I’d love to run a sub-4 hour marathon, and then it became sub-3 hours 45 minutes when I found my rhythm . . but those times had to go out the window with my achilles injury at the start of last week. I even thought I may pull out last minute 😖😢
-
I’m not going to lie, the race was tough! So so tough, physically and mentally. It felt like my achilles was snapping at the half-way point and everything went downhill in the last 6 miles 😅 The surprise finish will also all be explained in the vlog, because it’s definitely a story to tell 😂 
-
However, the atmosphere was insane and the crowds were honestly amazing!! London, I freaking love you 💚 
-
Huge congrats to all the other runners yesterday and I, of course, need to say a huge shoutout to the fam for capturing some epic moments on camera, @murderedabroad for offering me this opportunity in the first place, you guys for supporting me throughout this whole journey, @sportsshoes and @newbalance for kitting me out, and my legs, yes my legs, for not giving up despite the pain 😉
-
As I said, stay tuned for the full video tomorrow and there will be more action shots to come 😏 In the meantime, I’m in full-time rest mode with my foot stuck in ice and my medal around my neck 🏅🙌🏻
-
AHHH I’M STILL IN SHOCK 😭

#londonmarathon #weruntogether #londonmarathon2021 #vlm2021",run,"RUN WITH ME in Edinburgh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏃🏻‍♀️
-
I filmed this on my first day in the city and if you’ve watched episode 2 of the Edinburgh vlogs then you’ll know I did get drenched on this run 🙈🌧 However . . . as you guys know, running is simply my favourite way to explore a new place because you get to see so much on foot 👏🏻
-
I ran around the Meadows (which gets very busy with runners in the evening I realised), then basically got lost (not a surprise 😉), but I eventually ended up in Princes Street Gardens right by the castle 🏰
-
You’ll probably all know by now but I am running the @londonmarathon again this year 🤩🙌🏻 I got my place through the GFA (Good For Age) ballot because I qualified last year and this week we’re officially getting serious with the training again 💪🏻 
-
Now I’m hoping I can stick to my plan whilst also travelling this year. I mean, I’m always up for a challenge and you never know if something is possible until you try 😏
-
I’ll see you on @strava next week in a new country!!! 😆 ps: I’m loving my @newbalance Fuel Cells (gifted last year) 👌🏻

#runner #running #londonmarathon #marathontraining",home,"Highlights from 🇹🇭 Railay 🇹🇭 featuring Matthew’s two favourite things: monkeys and napping 😴😂🐒
-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (😉), let’s talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg 🤩 It’s not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip 🏝
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn’t say no to our £8 a night hotel room . . . £8 you guys!!! 😱 It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you’ll know)👌🏻
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay 👏🏻
-
🇹🇭 Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you 🙈 They’re cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
🇹🇭 Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn’t book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point 😆 . . .
-
🇹🇭 The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up 😂 It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 Once you’ve made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can’t tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn’t make me feel so great 😅
-
🇹🇭 I don’t actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing 🤨 There were places with vegan options, but I just didn’t pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country 😍 Please please visit 💚✨",running,"Apparently I’m away more than I’m at home at the moment, but at least London was sunny I guess 🤷🏻‍♀️😎🌞
-
In terms of the upload schedule (which goes a bit off when we’re travelling, as you guys know 😬🙈), there’s a weekly vlog from my 7 days at home and then we start the Spain travel vlogs . . . because yes, we’re in Barcelona baby (to start) 😏
-
To adventures, new experiences and spontaneity 🙃😉",new,"Berlin dump babyyyyy 🇩🇪👏🏻🏃🏻‍♀️
-
I still cannot believe how fast I ran my 10K race here 😭😅 A PB of 43:05 I was like whatttt!?!? My only other official running race previously has been the London Marathon last year, so I am super happy I entered and of course, the biggest shoutout to my supporters, camera crew, alternative vloggers and bag carriers 😏 . . . you know who you are 👀
-
The Berlin vlog was episode 8 in the Germany series (link in my bio), but if I had to pick my top 3 recommendations then I’d say the following:
-
🇩🇪 Go and chill at Tempelhof, the decommissioned airport 001 ✈️
-
🇩🇪 Vegan or not, you mustttt try the doughnuts from @brammibalsdonuts 002 😍
-
🇩🇪 And if you’re there next year around the same time, go and either run in the Berlin City Nights event, just go and watch or visit the Irish pub nearby (I heard it was good 🙃👌🏻) 003
-
The Hamburg vlog will be next so stay tuneddddd for that and happy hump day from me my friends ✌🏻💚",first,"@mkmarathon half marathon smashedddddd ✅🤩🥺🎉
-
I finished in 1:43:27 which I did not expect you guys 🙈 Plus, I was very happy with my last sprint to the finish line!! I’ve never been able to empty the tank like that before in a race, but I didn’t want the last hill (which was absolutely brutal btw) to fully get the better of me 😂😅
-
Angelo was my star of the show though, finishing in 1:34:04 😏🫶🏻 For his first race (on an injury too!!) I am super proud. And seeing him at the finish line waiting for me was the best ❤️
-
One day (when I’ve actually properly trained 🙈) I cannot wait to be running hopefully side-by-side, but we’ve got a lot of work to do because my guy is a speedy rocket and not slowing down 🚀😉
-
Shoutout to those of you I met at the event today, and for you all here online supporting me every mile of the way 🦋 Stay tuned for the full vlog that will be out later this week 🏃🏻‍♀️
-
Ok so now I’ll make it official: Holly is back in the game my friends 😏
-
#running #runner #halfmarathon",bit,"Blue sky days, duo day trips and a denim jacket that seems to feature in every single photo at the moment lol 😅🙈 June photo dump!!!
-
So summer for me starts in London 🇬🇧 I love the city (fun fact: I was actually born here in Greenwich 😉) and there’s always so much going on when the weather gets warmer! I’m also trying to make the most of it because summer certainly won’t finish here 😏🌞🙈
-
*cough cough* #hollygoessolo officially returns at the end of this week and I am SO excited you guys 🤩 Me and my (new) backpack might get caught in some rain but . . . I’m all here for the adventure!!! I mean, I am starting to question why I’ve signed myself up to do certain things, but I’m starting to realise that I’m verrrrrry very good at turning pretty much anything into a fun, spicy adventure 🌶🌍
-
After that (so the start of July, for context 🙃) I’ll be home pretty briefly before I leave for a longer trip (the itinerary is already planned out, bright and colourful as always because we expect nothing less 🤌🏻) but I’ll leave knowing that I’m officially a UCL gradate woo (6th ofJuly, the hat will be flying 😂)🎓🧬
-
All the details and updates are coming in the vlogs very soon, and I literally cannot explain how excited I am to bring you guys along some new backpacking adventures!!! 🙌🏻💚",definitely,"MUNICH 🇩🇪🤩 . . . just the start anyway 😏
-
Ngl I think I’ve looked lost, scared or confused my whole time in Munich (😅), but the memories have been made and we LivED iN tHe MomEnT ok 🤩🇩🇪 Definitely sad to leave this place 😢 
-
I also know this is very last minute and it won’t be anything official, BUT if anyone local wants to come and say hi then I’ll be around Marienplatz at 14:30 ish this afternoon before I need to get my train to my next destination in Germany!!
-
There is a bit of a delay in me posting the next video, but the adventures here in Munich will be all in episode 5, after the next one 😉 Very excited to edit this one!!! 👌🏻

honestly, i never ate apples with peanut butter as a kid because in my chinese immigrant household, peanut butter was pretty much only used for peanut sauce to mix into noodles, fruit was usually only eaten at the end of meals (def not a food combiner 🤷🏻‍♀️👋🏽), and snacks were just not really a thing (lol times have definitely changed for me). but, i can deeefinitely understand why the combo is a classic, and what more fun way to eat it than in the form of apple nachos!
