0,0,#glutenfree,"if you know me at all, you know bowls like these are basically my entire personality 🫡long time followers will remember my loaded veg bowls from college! 

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it’s about 5 or 6 cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i’d say about 1 cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at 400F for 25 min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at 400F for 10 min)
- 1/2 cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- 1/4 cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
- 3 tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i’ve been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

weeknight vegan chili

1 chopped onion
3 stalks celery, diced
3 large carrots, diced
1 can pinto beans rinsed and drained
1 can black beans rinsed and drained
1 can cherry tomatoes 
2 cups water
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
sea salt
garlic powder

sauté the onion in a generous amount of olive oil and sea salt until soft and browned. then add celery and carrots and  cook for another few minutes until browned. add cherry tomatoes, pinto and black beans, balsamic vinegar, spices, and water. bring to a boil and then reduce to simmer, cooking for about 40 minutes with frequent stirring! if it reduces too much add more water and cook for a few minutes longer. this made three portions for me!

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott’s book ‘vegan one pot wonders’)

-1 cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for 2 hours
-1 onion, diced
-1 clove of garlic, minced
-1 cup each of diced carrots and celery
-1 bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
-2 cups water
-2 cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about 35 minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don’t stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

sauté an onion in olive oil and sea salt until brown. add in diced carrots, chopped zucchini, a bit more oil, and cook until browned and soft. after a few minutes toss in rinse and drained chickpeas and pre-roasted eggplant cubes (i used mine from meal prep!). pour in one can of tomato puree and an equal amount of filtered water. i added more sea salt and lots of cumin (because cumin and chickpeas is such an amazing combo IMO!). cover with a lid and cook on medium heat until the liquid gets absorbed and it gets thick (this took about 40 minutes with stirring every 5/10 minutes). that’s it! i let mine sit off the heat uncovered for a bit after those 40 minutes just to thicken a  touch more. served over fluffy quinoa (just following package instructions)!

1,1,home,Day 91 was pretty eventful. I woke up early because I didn’t sleep well the night before. I went back to bed shortly after. I was kinda out of it for most of the day but I was able to get some drawing done. The afternoon was really hard for me and I ended up self harming pretty badly. I got sent to the ER to get checked out and I’ll hopefully be back to the unit soon.,baby,Day 31 of inpatient was mostly good. I went to a lot of groups and got to go on a walk outside so that was nice. I tried to stay out of my room for most of the day and that was hard bc I was really tired. I ended up taking a nap in the evening but then hung out with friends after. One of my closest friends is leaving soon and I’m sad but also happy for her.,school,Day 36 of inpatient was okay. I didn’t sleep well last night (as usual). I went to a couple groups but didn’t really like them. My parents visited and I was anxious about that but it actually went okay. Then I took a nap and I’ve basically been in bed for most of the evening and also just the entire day bc I took a nap this morning too. I’m just so tired all the time and I don’t want to be awake.,run,"One mile time trial  My 5k running training schedule had me run a one mile time trial for the last two Sundays. The first time wasn’t so bad because I’d never done a time trial before ever so I didn’t know what was coming. The second time, yesterday, oh my goodness it was hard. I went out too fast and then just wanted to give up and walk 🥵  There’s a really convenient road loop not too far from me that’s exactly a mile long but the corner I started from means that the first half of the mile is slightly (only slightly) downhill and the second half is slightly uphill, so even harder to run. If I have to do it again, I’m going to start from a different corner!! I was so relieved when I’d finished and my schedule revealed next Sunday’s run and it was a long run rather than another time trial.",went,Day 46 of inpatient was mostly good. I spent time with friends in the morning and then went to tms. I took a nap after tms and then went to some groups. I found out that my friend is leaving tomorrow and I’m sad. My anxiety is really bad right now and I’m not doing well. The rest of the day was good though. My doctor told me that I will be here for a long time and that’s a bummer. It hasn’t really hit me yet.,morning,"Question: You’ve mentioned the shortened groups on the unit, what other precautions are they taking on the unit? Do you still meet with your team every day? Answer: We aren’t allowed to have visitors or things dropped off/delivered. We still meet with our team every day. Some staff members have had to take time off not necessarily bc they have the virus but bc they are being extra careful.",last,Day 35 of inpatient was boring. I slept for most of the day bc I had a headache. Then I had tms and my headache got worse. I talked to a doctor and he suggested that I get dark glasses to wear over my glasses and that’s supposedly going to make my migraines go away. My friend and I did a puzzle for eight hours straight and basically never left our room. It was an okay day.,days,"Phew I just went out with d1 for her first driving practice in our car. Omg it’s quite terrifying being at the mercy of a 17 year old behind the wheel of your car! She’s had 10 hours of lessons. She’s doing pretty well really although she doesn’t like to go past second gear (and I’m not complaining because the few times we got into third gear felt like we were going far too fast). We drove a few miles down a long quiet road twice and did a couple of loops of an estate. Driving instructors are heroes. I couldn’t do that all day every day, my nerves would be shot. If I wasn’t toying with being sober for October, I’d have a glass of wine right now.",friends,Question: Are you still allowed to leave for TMS? Answer: I actually stopped doing tms a few days ago bc it wasn’t working for me. Other people on the unit are allowed to leave for tms/ect/ketamine but only bc we’re inpatient. I think outpatient appointments have stopped.,tomorrow,"Two-run-Saturday   I’ve been for two runs today. I didn’t plan it that way, but I went to parkrun (got a PB, yay!!) and then came home and looked at the weather forecast because I heard rumours of a big STORM approaching. Seriously looks like it’s going to be hard to even stay upright never mind run, so in the afternoon after I’d done an hour of maths tutoring, I popped back out to do my 50 minute “easy run”. It is easy, it’s at a very steady pace, I just put my headphones on and trot along enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. So now, run done and tomorrow can be a rest day with all the wind and rain from Storm Ciara. I think it might still be bad on Monday when I am scheduled to run, but I will deal with that when we get there."

People are commenting about how they can’t believe a young woman’s body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else’s body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can’t possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they’re human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I’m leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn’t always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We’re all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society’s standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I’d rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here’s to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you’re absolutely bangin’!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

Happy Real Me Monday, except it’s also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren’t enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don’t is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn’t brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can’t possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they’re someone’s very best photo, they’re the highlight of someone else’s life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it’s close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That’s why it’s so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it’s all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn’t reflect the reality of the situation.

1. We are all our own harshest critics & 2. Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide 2 is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the 1% of someone’s life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

The truth is, I used to compare myself to the posed, edited & perfected photos of other women on the internet. Then I’d pose, edit & perfect my own photos in order to feel half as beautiful as they appeared to be, and without me realising, that would’ve caused another woman to jump online & compare her body to the posed, edited & perfected photos of mine.

Leave a ‘🥲👑’ in the comments if this is something you can relate to, because I know I’m not the only one 👀

This is exactly why I started posting this series 23 weeks ago... I don’t want you to see my photos & wish you were beautiful like me, I want you to see that being beautiful LIKE YOU is good enough. I want you to feel better after seeing my posts, not worse. I hope you’ll feel encouraged to wear the shorts, instead of covering up & hiding yourself away. I hope you’ll remember that what you see on social media is a highlight reel & that you have no reason to be ashamed of the body you’re in.

I’m not joking when I say that getting the photos on the left took me AGES. They took the right lighting, twisting my body in the right position to elongate the right places, sucking in, tensing hard & holding my breath. The photos on the right took a split second because that’s just ME.

So please, don’t compare yourself.
If you continuously compete with others, you become bitter. But if you continuously aim to improve yourself and your own self-thoughts, you become better. It’s you VS you 💛

You’re wonderful. 
And this week is going to be great!
That is all — can’t wait to chat with you in the comments 🌈

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we’ve been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don’t have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven’t done our hair, makeup, we’re feeling super bloated, etc. That isn’t a bad thing. That doesn’t make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn’t live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don’t owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they’re all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don’t let your mind (or anyone else’s) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn’t compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you’ll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It’s hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you’re always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you’re just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you’re laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn’t be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It’s officially been 2 years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else’s I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You’ve got this xo

Happy Real Me Monday ✨ FITTING ROOM ✨ edition ⤵️

A “bad body image day” can be triggered by many things… Sometimes it’s seeing yourself in the mirror, sometimes it’s sizing up or down in clothes, sometimes it’s comparing yourself to others... Just to name a few. 

But a lot of the time, what you see doesn’t reflect the reality of the situation. Whether that’s in the mirror, trying on clothes or seeing photos online.

1. We are all our own harshest critics 
2. You’ve only ever seen yourself in the mirror or in photos, so you will never actually see your true beauty. 
3. Lighting, angles, posing, different lenses & mirrors can change the way we look — especially in fitting rooms. Some stores use mirror manipulation or softer lighting to hide lumps & bumps. Some stores use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... But in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!
4. Sizing differs so much 😅 I size up & down depending on the store or fit! 🤯 (P.s. sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you’ve experienced any of this before!

You are not your size. You are not your appearance. There is so much more to you than that 💗

Remember, a bad body image MOMENT doesn’t have to turn into a bad body image DAY. Acknowledge the way you’re speaking to yourself, take a deep breath & consciously try to switch to more gentle thoughts!!

Please be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

P.s. for those asking, my hair was done recently by @_edwardsandco — we went a lil bit darker & I’m loving it!! 🫶

Seeing yourself so exposed, under harsh lighting, with mirrors showing so many angles that you usually don’t see yourself in… In one store, you might feel great, but the next makes you feel worse. One store you’re a size M & the next you’re an L. One mirror makes you look taller, another wider. The list goes on.

Happy ✨ Real Me Monday ✨ with a difference.

This was one of the triggers I had years ago that made me suddenly want to “start a new d!et”… Fitting rooms would tear any confidence I had left to shreds. I’d always end up in tears or completely deflated for the rest of the day.

So I wanted to leave these photos here to show you that it IS possible to eventually smile back at that reflection & not have it ruin your day. It is possible to not feel ashamed of being seen. It’s possible to be at peace with your body & everything you’ve grown up being taught to hate. And it has nothing to do with actually changing your body… Just your mindset! 🧠 

I realise I’m saying this in a “thin” body which has its own privileges such as being able to find clothes in sizes that fit me & stereotypically fitting the beauty standard. But I can only showcase my reality & I’d rather do that then portray perfection. I know that most of the time, our own harshest critic is OURSELVES, so when it comes to our body image, it’s about how WE view & speak to ourselves. 

You deserve your own kindness. When you get down about your appearance & dream of the “perfect” body, please remember there is no such thing… No matter what you see online!! Under different lighting, lenses, angles & poses, you’ll always look different. But one day, you’ll look in the mirror to see the same body that has kept you alive for 80 years… It won’t look the same, but you’ll realise the way it looked never really mattered, you’ll just be grateful it’s your home 🏡

And when you start believing your body *is* good, it makes it a whole lot easier to feel more confident, comfortable & appreciative of that body. 

“But how do I start truly believing my body is good?” you might be wondering…

Well, your mind is a powerful tool. So when you declare something, your brain looks for evidence to confirm it. So if you declare: “I’m not good enough”, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It’ll disregard everything that doesn’t.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative reinforcement & critical self-talk. But if you just shifted your mindset & put your energy into more positive thoughts instead, that could change your life.

That’s why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

The next time you speak down to yourself, know that ONLY YOU have the power to give yourself kindness & positivity. Your body image is a reflection of your mindset, it’s influenced by what  you believe & all of the messages you tell yourself. Some of those messages will be influenced by external sources like the media, your family, friends etc but it’s up to you whether you take those opinions on as your own.

For me, I’m no longer telling myself I’m only beautiful when I’m sucking in, hiding away & portraying perfection. I’m choosing to accept myself as I am & because of that, I’m constantly seeking everything in my life that reinforces that thought, I’m constantly seeking the magic in myself, and I believe it now, my body is good, it keeps me healthy & safe. It’s my home 🥺

You have the power, never forget that 💛

So if the story in your mind is “I’m not good enough”, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It’ll disregard everything that doesn’t. This is why we see our cellulite, rolls, bloating, stretch marks, pimples, wobbly skin, etc as a bad thing… Because we’ve been hardwired to believe that from a young age, so our brains constantly put a magnifying glass over these parts of ourselves & make us believe we need to fix ourselves.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative thoughts & overly critical self-talk. But imagine what shifting your mindset & putting your energy into positive thoughts has the power to do?!

When you start acknowledging how wonderful, strong and GOOD ENOUGH you are, your brain will start looking for ways to confirm that instead. So, surround yourself with people, messages and things that you love because your mind can be a place that either makes you or breaks you. That power is yours.

That’s why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

All it takes is starting the day looking through a positive lens to change your entire perspective. Have you tried it before? 🤷🏻‍♀️ I encourage you to write in the comments the kind of affirmations you’re going to start telling yourself this week… Here are some that I personally love:

- I am good enough.
- I make others happy!
- My body is healthy and capable and strong! 💪🏼
- How good my day is is up to me!
- I’m loved
- I don’t HAVE to workout, nourish my body or get my work done today… I GET to do those things, and that’s a blessing!

How about you? 🥰 I’d love to hear them & I’m sure they’ll give someone else inspiration too!

4,4,therapy,"Therapy 3.11.20 // struggling to speak   I’m struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I’d written down. But although they’d felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don’t think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn’t get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren’t really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn’t find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were ‘generational’, did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn’t believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn’t feel like it did. I said that I don’t feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I’m not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don’t need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we’d got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I’d believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after 3 years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it’s not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it’s like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.",session,"Therapy 21.07.20 // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn’t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she’d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don’t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we’ve been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don’t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don’t say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that’s exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that’s likely what I’m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I’m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It’s what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I’m not ready to go there. “No! I’m just telling you that if you’re waiting for me to do it, I probably won’t.” “What I’m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we’ll have year from then to process our ending. I’m thinking we’ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you’ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that’s all very well, but I hope she knows I’m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can’t believe I’ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven’t really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I’m just not ready to be without her.",therapist,"Therapy 16.03.21 // reading between the lines  When we had finally got the internet issues resolved and we had a stable zoom connection, I sat there looking at T and feeling completely derailed after all the upheaval. “I feel all over the place now” I wailed, waving my hands in the air. T said yes she did too and she asked me if I’d like her to pray. This isn’t something she usually does but it felt right in this situation. She prayed and I felt calmed and soothed and like we were centred and back together in the ‘room’. So then I tried to get started. I said to T “Do you remember last session that I ran out of time to say something at the end?” and when she nodded I carried on “That was about something you said the session before… when you said you would always be honest and real with me.” T said she remembered that. I said that I had felt quite emotional when she said it. We dug down a little to find out what kind of emotion it was, and eventually I said that it was relief. That if I knew she was going to be straight up with me, then I no longer had to worry about reading between the lines of what she might be saying but not saying. I spent all my childhood reading between the lines of what my parents were saying, and it’s hard work to always be hypervigilant for what’s actually happening - or what you imagine is actually happening. The two things play into each other, when you’re hypervigilant and highly sensitive, you can create whole scenarios that may or may not be based in reality. I don’t know how much of that is me reading things between the lines that weren’t there and getting upset about imagined scenarios that weren’t actually reality, and how much is me genuinely picking up on things that were going on below the surface. I suppose that’s something I have to be ok with not knowing because there’s no way of going back in time with adult eyes to find out. I said to T that I needed her to know that if she says that she will be honest and real and I don’t need to read between the lines, then I won’t. And so if she wants me to know something, she needs to tell it to me straight up and not expect me to figure it out from what she’s said. I said “so if we have a rupture and I get all stressed about something I’ve thought you’ve implied, then I’m going to try and soothe myself by reminding myself that you didn’t actually say the words that my brain is creating from what you did say. So I need you to not get frustrated with me for not picking up on what you might have meant but not said.” It took ages for me to make clear to T what I was trying to say. I nearly gave up a few times and trailed off talking. She said “Am I not really getting you right now?” and I said “no, not really”. T encouraged me to stick with it and keep trying to explain it, and she did eventually get it and summarise it beautifully in a couple of sentences. When she did that, I immediately relaxed and smiled and nodded that she’d got it bang on. T said that was fine and she would continue to try her best to be be honest and real with me and she wouldn’t expect me to pick up things she hadn’t actually said. She reminded me that I can always check things out in session, if she’s said something and I wonder if she’s implying something else. I will try and do that, although often I don’t process what she’s said till after the session. I too quickly get caught up in session with “oh she must be meaning this” and then I tend to close it down with shame because my brain always translates it that she’s trying to tell me I’m not good enough in some way. So that’s something to watch out for in future sessions and also to try and spot when it happens to me in conversations with other people outside of therapy.",talk,"Therapy 10.03.20 // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There’s always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week’s list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don’t have a list this week, it’s been too mad and I’m too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn’t get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe 6 weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I’m not quite sure what you’re asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don’t want you to feel trapped in it, like with d1 about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she’s grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you’ve given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She’s almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn’t get enough emotional regulation and so you’re still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you’ve pretty much got that now. Now you’re learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That’s my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she’ll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that’s ok, it’s ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It’s annoying because I’ve got it all written out, so I don’t know why I’m struggling for words. They’re all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I’m closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that’s when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she’d forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn’t remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you’ve picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I’ve had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don’t tell me what it is don’t tell me what it is don’t tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It’s ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that’s what happens in relationships. It’s life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it’s ok for you to tell me if you think I’m losing track, that’s ok, that’s your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it’s my responsibility, that’s why I’m doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I’m not mad. I just want to know that you know where we’re up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don’t really want to have to say all that again.”",bit,"Therapy 14.04.20 // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I’m about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there’s an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I’m just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn’t remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn’t the same supervisor as the one that didn’t like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for 6 years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That’s because I’d perfected my blank face because I’d learnt it as a child that it wasn’t safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.",talking,"Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don’t like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don’t know why when she brings it up, it’s always at the end of a session. It’s risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn’t want to push aside the stuff I’m bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I’d been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn’t said it out loud to anyone. I’ve started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of 2019, the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I’m trying to say something but it’s hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I’d been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I’ve said it out loud, I don’t want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that’s something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don’t want to stop therapy. I don’t want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don’t want it.",felt,"Therapy 11.02.20 // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d3 was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn’t time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let’s not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn’t have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I’d text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of 10 I’d give me and H’s relationship, and I didn’t think too much about it but just said “8”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an 8, so she knew we weren’t looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we’re not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that’s a big statement. And we don’t have time to unpack it now.” I hadn’t really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that’s how it ended up. I hadn’t even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that’s therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don’t know what T made of it but I’m happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that’s when I suddenly remembered that I’m not here next week because it’s school holidays and we’re away. I’d been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn’t affect my sessions) and wondering whether she’d be back today, that I hadn’t looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it’s a therapy break because I’m away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it’s blindsided me a bit.",maybe,"Therapy 08.09.20 // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I’d just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it’s really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn’t have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it’s been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you’re ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that’s hard for you to answer because you don’t know what I’m going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it’s so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it’s just what you’ve always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn’t sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.",end,"Therapy 23.02.21 // is this part 3? I’ve lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she’d noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. “When you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you’ve had enough of me talking about my childhood.” T said that she wasn’t saying any of that at all. She doesn’t think we’re going round in circles and if we’re spiralling around something, it’s that we’re going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn’t coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of ‘Faith is quite happy with this’, and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it’s time. I nodded ruefully. It’s ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now 9 years later I’m still here and don’t want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. “You look like you’re about to say something” T commented. “I’m deliberating whether to say it or not” I said, pulling a face. “Go on then, let’s just say it”  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I’d done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I’d done another thing since then and I said no. T said “ok, sooo… it was a blip”. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn’t do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I’m going to go easy on myself over it.",last,"Therapy 02.02.21 // an emotional pressure valve  T asked me how I was doing this week, after I was so upset all through last week’s therapy session. I gave her a brief rundown of how the situation had been resolved and that I felt much better about it now. After saying she was glad it had improved, she said “Do you want to talk some more about that?” I said that I was frustrated about the timing of it, because if therapy had been on a Friday than it would all have been over by the time I saw her and I could have used my session for something more useful. In a way, I suppose I’m glad it happened when it did because it meant she did see me right in the middle of a triggered state, rather than me just telling her about it after it has passed.  “Did you know before we talked last week that you were triggered because it reminded you of your dad?” T asked. I nodded. T carried on, “Would it help if another time you spoke to H or a friend and said I’m finding this really difficult because it reminds me of my dad, and I need a bit of extra support?” I said that it wouldn’t “because I just need to push it down and it feels so unbearable that I can’t even face speaking about it. If I keep it absolutely still, I can try and pretend that it doesn’t exist and then I can carry on looking like I’m functioning” T pointed out that I spoke to her about it in therapy, and I said I didn’t have much choice because I couldn’t talk about anything else and so the only alternative would have been to cancel the session and I didn’t want to do that. Two things come to mind when I write this out. The first is that when T suggested I reach out to H or my friend if a similar situation happened again, I felt so adamantly that there was no way I could do that. But gradually as that seed has been planted in my mind, it has felt more of a possibility. To be honest, I think I feel like I could not dump it all on H. I am the one that has the answers and the solutions, and I would only dump it on him if ultimately I had a solution as well. It would seem somehow unfair to put all my anxiety onto him and then not leave it in a nice tidied up place at the end.  The second thing is that I felt safe talking about it with T because I know that she can contain whatever I bring to therapy. She can’t help with a practical solution and so that takes that pressure off needing to end the conversation with taking all my anxiety back to myself. In this way, talking to T is like a one-way pressure valve that relieves a bunch of emotional pressure and then shuts again at the end of the session. Whereas I imagine talking to H would be like the two of us shut in a closed system and when I release a load of emotional pressure, it just expands and bounces around in the box, squashing us both. I think I’ll talk about those two things in therapy next week."

(discount code & dress names in caption) 🫶 

We love a hype girl who accidentally offends me every now & then with his clothing descriptions & then reverts to the safety of “that’s my favourite!!!” 🫠 his heart is in the right place HAHAHA. [ad]

But for real though, it's amazing how a nice wardrobe can make me feel SO READY for any occasion. You wanna go bowling? Perfect, I've got an outfit for that. You wanna book a business meeting? Got an outfit for that! Picnic? Sorted. Date night? Sorted! Fancy event? SORTED!!! The way we dress and carry ourselves can make up such a big part of our identity. I used to only ever wear long black jeans, a jumper & a scarf to hide myself & not stand out... Now I wear what I truly want to wear & I feel so much more like ME!

I actually filmed this for my IG stories but then spontaneously decided to share it to my feed, so I hope y'all enjoy something a lil different! 😂 

Which outfit is your favourite?!?! 😍 My Petal & Pup code is LOVEBREE for 20% off (this works on already marked down items as well) in case you like any of these cutie outfits!! For reference, the dress names are below:
1. Cabila Tiered Maxi Dress Green
2. Jordan Cut-out Mini Dress White
3. Annette Puff Sleeve Shirred Midi Dress Cornflower Blue
4. Solitaire Suit Jacket Playsuit White
5. Muroni Long Sleeve Cut Out Maxi Dress Orange Floral

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there’s something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that’s so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you’d dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i’d honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

- 3 large ripe bananas, mashd
- 1/2 cup melted coconut oil
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract 
- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to 350F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you’d like (i used 1 cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for 35-40 min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted 1 cup of chocolate chunks with 1 heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave (2 increments of 30 seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it’s so dreamy!

VEGAN copycat cookie cake bars

set oven to 350. grease a loaf pan. in a small bowl, make a flax egg by mixing together 1 tbsp ground flax and 2.5 tbsp water. let sit until thick.

in a large bowl mix together:

- 1/3 cup coconut sugar
- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil
- splash of vanilla

ad the flax egg and stir until everything is thoroughly combined. then add:

- 1 cup almond flour
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

mix until a thick, sticky dough forms. fold through chocolate chips of choice, then cover bowl and place in fridge for 30 minutes.

meanwhile, in a food processor add:

- 1/2 cup almond butter
- 1/2 cup soft pitted dates
- pinch of sea salt

run the blender. after a few seconds, slowly pour in a tablespoon of warm water and let it run through the mixture. add one more if the blade isn’t moving much! the mix here should be sticky and rollable, not watery.

add the almond butter/date mixture to the dough, the mix thoroughly with hands until sticky and well combined. if the batter is a dit dry, feel free to add up to 2 tbsp dairy free milk. stir through chocolate chips at this point as well! transfer dough to the loaf pan and press down until even. bake for about 15 minutes, then let cool completely before slicing

10,10,fucking,"how annoying.  ive been getting 3 hrs of sleep a night for the last 2 weeks because of my animals. ive woken up in the night screaming hysterically for seemingly no reason, ive woken up to my animals having difficulties and in grave danger/in need of assistance. I cant get solid sleep because they’ve needed me. my cat dies yesterday. im up til… god… 7-8 am crying by myself? who knows it was light outside. I turned my phone off because my boyfriend kept trying to argue with me and make me feel worse than I already do. I finally get to sleep this morning, for the first time is weeks. im underfed and im underslept and overwhelmed.  im at my breaking point. I need sleep so badly that im imaging my dead cat giving me permission to do so. I finally get to sleep, finally get some rest, some peace, a brief fleeting moment away from the pain that is physically weighing me down and I wake up to someone banging on my door at noon.  nobody is home and my phone is off.  I assume its ups or some shit dropping off a package. they love to knock even though it makes my 3 dogs go absolutely mad. but the knocking doesn’t stop. it keeps going and getting more urgent. what the fuck. now im up, and im mad. I didn’t even bother to look out my window, I just started throwing clothes on and screaming. “I HEAR YOU” Im hurting myself at this point because i’m yelling so loud. I can go from 0 to loud ass bitch...LOUDEST bitch in 0.4 seconds. im losing my balance struggling to dress and they just keep knocking so now im screaming hysterically and my window is cracked near the front of the house so all I hear is my grandma going “WHAT!?”. and then I realize it’ my grandma. and then 0.4 seconds later I finally get this hoodie zipped over my bare tits and I clear a flight of stairs and finally get to the door and shes just driving away. like REALLY? what the FUCK was that? I don’t even feel bad im not even going to turn my phone on and apologize for cussing at her unknowingly like im not even gonna explain myself because I just don’t care. she lives 5 min away she can go home. I cant ever get one nice day of sleep. I don’t know what everyone wants from me. im doing so much right now and im doing my best and I cant even turn my phone off and sleep for 8 hours for one fucking day when I really need it,. im losing my mind I just need to be left alone. she knows my cat died yesterday and if im not answering my phone why would you just show up and start frantically knocking. can you not knock and wait. I get that its cold but like realistically I don’t know what the fuck she was thinking or expecting or wanting. people  never wanna help me they always just wanna bother me.  and im not even talking about yal. everyone on the internet his mostly either been supportive or apathetic which I appreciate/don’t mind. but life doesn’t exist inside of the internet unfortunately. I can only play escapism to feel better for so long until I have to come back to reality or get behind on it. I feel like im always being the bigger person and comforting everyone else in my life but nobody can ever afford that same courtesy to me and its really getting old.  the least u cld do is leave me the fuck alone so I can focus figuring out how to give myself the energy that im constantly giving everyone else. I just wanted some relief from the intrusive thoughts today but now we’re up and at it since the dogs had to lose their fucking shit. I honestly hate these dogs im so sick of them.  I don’t know why we had to have 3. everything was fine when I had MY dog, and my dad had his, 2. but then my fucking waste of space brother decides hE wAnTs a DoG tOo because its not fair that We BoTh HaVe OnE.  so my spineless father gets him a fucking dog that he cant even take care of for a WEEK and now we just have this dumbass untrained puppy taking up space and eating shit and making messes and fucking up the pack dynamic with the other 2.  my dog has always been challenging with behavioral problems and they’ve just gotten tenfold worse since this fucking 3rd dog came into our lives. now its to the point where she isn’t even manageable for me.  I hate this third dog. hes not disciplined.  my dad doesn’t discipline any of the dogs and he always enables them and undoes the work that ive put in with their unruly asses. I hate it.  I hate having 3 big dogs constantly in my way and trying to boss me around and lurk and steal me and my other animal’s food. I never asked for that responsibility. I never asked for any of these responsibilities.  I have 3 animals that belong to me and THEY ARE MANAGEABLE by themselves but once you throw in the family cat with a tumor that NOBODY else was paying attention to or worrying about, and 2 other huge ass dogs that don’t get adequate attention bc my dad and brother are pieces of shit who don’t get up from their desks more than 3x a day tops. if theyre even here. so I get stuck tending to their asses.  im just over it.  I love animals but theyare taking over my life and not in a good way. literally my only friends are animals and theyre gonna die soon too and then im left with nothing. nothing done, no friends, no money. nothing. because I spent it all on 3 extra animals that I never even signed up to fucking have.  I signed up for 3. not fucking 6. the animals wont leave me alone humans wont leave me alone im literally ready to flip a bitch and explode because all I want is to be left alone.  if nobody wants to even try making me feel better, if nobody can bring themselves to be considerate for once…. then just LEAVE ME ALONE. WHATS IT GONNA FUCKING TAKE. most days I don’t actually want to kill myself, sometimes I actually do. but these days I feel like I don’t even have a choice and one day its going to be my only option because I cannot escape my frustration",shit,"Question: last night i got reallyyyyy high and threw up twice, the 2nd time at this dudes house and i had just met him haha im so embarrassed honestly but at least it was in the toilet?? idk lol needed to rant about how embarrassed i am rn  Answer: dont feel embarassed. pls dont agonize u did good, u made it to the toilet. one time a guy was driving me home after a night of drinking, probably beinf roofied, and losing my virginity - and i was too embarassed to ask him to pull over so i silently puked into an empty gatorade bottle. still to this day idk if he knew. im assuming theres no way you cannot know LOL.

While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.
⁠
Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ⇣⁠
✨ the 8 year old version of you ⁠
✨ the 80 year old version of you
✨ people who are curious about the things you are but don’t have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
✨ people who your message will inspire and change
⁠
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It’s true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

Being a highly sensitive person (HSP) doesn’t have to weigh you down. I consider it a gift to be able to feel into so many situations/people/places✨

i used to put much emphasis on how difficult it is to be sensitive, but after some time i noticed there are so many ways that this can be my STRENGTH!

Some (of many) benefits of being able to feel deeply and fully are:

🔮Enhanced intuition: HSPs are often able to pick up on subtleties in their environment and relationships that others might miss. This can lead to a heightened sense of intuition and the ability to make insightful decisions.

🥹Deep empathy: HSPs often have a deep capacity for empathy and are able to understand and connect with others on a deep emotional level. This can make them excellent friends, partners, and nurturers.

👩🏻‍🎨Creative skills: HSPs often have a rich inner world and a vivid imagination, which can make them excellent artists, writers, and creative thinkers.

👀🔎Ability to see the bigger picture: Because they are so observant, HSPs have a broad perspective and can see the interconnectedness of things. This can make them effective problem solvers and strategic thinkers! 

😻Appreciation for beauty: HSPs often have a keen appreciation for beauty and are able to deeply appreciate art, nature, and other forms of beauty.

⚖️Strong sense of morality: HSPs often have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact in the world.

😌💭Deep self-awareness: HSPs are highly introspective and self-aware, which can lead to a deep understanding of their own needs and desires.

being a highly sensitive person can bring many benefits, and i help my clients see how they can make their “sensitivity” their STRENGTH 💪🏽 in living their most aligned life.

the ones who contemplate:

📚“Man, I wish i chose a different major.” 

🥾“I wish I chose a different life path.”

🖇“I wish I didn’t take this job.”

ESPECIALLY if you see your friends or people that you know, or maybe people on Facebook loving the life that they chose. 

Here’s a reframe to try out:  ✨There is something in that contrast that you would like for your own life. ✨

It’s actually a blessing to have that feeling because it confirms there’s something you actually want.

Your work is in learning how to shift your current life, into the life that you want to live. 

If you can see these comparisons as enlightening tools for you to identify what you want in your life vs. seeing them as “something I’ll never have and I’m stuck with the lesser option,”

🦋I promise you, things in your life will start changing.🦋

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you’re excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you’re doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you’re doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that’s not actually true for me right now”
❌”i’m not in abundance right now”
❌”I can’t do that”

you’re not asking for what’s real, you’re thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

PS- spots are booking up into February! so even if you aren’t ready yet or sure of when you want to start, get your application in so we can set it all up for you",care,"lessons to take into august:

pay attention to who you are and how you feel when you’re around people. the wrong people may make you feel shrunken down and anxious. the right people soothe your soul and allow you to be your authentic self.

it’s okay to take a step back or disappear for awhile even if that means disappointing others or taking a break from things you love. prioritize yourself. the world can wait.

even when you feel broken, everything you need to feel whole is within yourself, not others. other people can add happiness to your life, but don’t let them be the primary source of it.

not everything goes as planned, and that is okay. allow yourself to find grace and peace in the midst of chaos and uncertainty. be patient with the timing of your journey.

just because it feels like you might be going backwards doesn’t mean that you are. allow yourself to think of your journey as a spiral, not a circle. even if it feels like you’re starting over, this time you are starting with more experience.

july was a bit of a blur for me filled with some high highs and also a lot of low lows, but i’m grateful for the learned lessons and the opportunity to keep moving upwards and onwards. here’s to a new month! and remember, no matter what august brings, you are still growing into the person you are meant to be 💌",lot,"Maybe you’re tired of living the same day all over again

Maybe you’re tired of scrolling seeing other people doing the thing you want to do

Maybe you’re tired of feeling like you’ll never get to do the things you want because of your situation

The difference between you right now & the people you strive to be like, or your dream vision “you” is that…

You’re still in your comfort zone.

You’ve let the small things keep you here, rather than throw them right back and move forward with your beautiful gentle power.

Getting to a new, more exciting place requires stepping out and trusting yourself. 

I’ve coached women through leaving their job, starting a new venture, finally taking the trainings they have been too scared to take, traveling the world for their heart’s sake, and actually pausing everything to do the RESTING that their bodies have craved.

So here’s to trusting yourself, trusting yourself to get up, brush yourself off, and to keep moving.

i don’t talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone’s health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn’t dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.",health,"i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they’re meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i’ve been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i’ve been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can’t dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we’d all still have different bodies.
- someone else’s body doesn’t tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone’s body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.",healthy,"velfevev: 

 thinhip: 

 psa  stop telling people with eds that weight lifting will make them bulky. it literally, scientifically cannot make you bigger if youre in a caloric deficit. in fact, just doing cardio while losing weight has some really undesirable side effects, including: loose, saggy skinmuscle atrophysignificant decrease in strengthdecrease in metabolism speed due to muscle losslower energy levelsdecrease in endurance strength why won’t it make me bigger, you ask? where’s the proof? well, it’s in the science. muscle cannot grow while in a caloric deficit, especially in one as extreme as we put ourselves in. while it can be strengthened and toned, it physically cannot grow without a surplus of calories. surplus meaning an extra 200-500 calories OVER your TDEE. if you ate this much and did weight training, you would see growth and a higher number on the scale. however, in a caloric deficit, you will only see a decrease in weight/body fat percentage and a higher lean muscle mass percentage, while looking smaller yet more tight and toned. muscle also burns around 60% more calories per hour than fat does. that being, having more lean muscle mass than body fat will increase your BMR and your metabolism even while idle. some benefits to weight training are: increase in strengthincrease in enduranceheightened metabolismlower body fat percentagehigher energy levelstight, “fitting” skinboost in moods/emotional stability TL;DR, cardio alone may burn lots of calories in the moment, but in the end will not give you the results you desire. pair daily cardio with frequent muscle training and you will achieve the tight, toned, and yet thin and small frame look youre going for, along with better moods, a higher metabolism, and various other benefits. 

 THIS is like my biggest pet peeve ever. People have no idea how much work and food it takes to actually gain muscle mass, especially for women. Like, you don’t accidentally just become ‘bulky’ and look like a professional body builder, so just stop worrying already.",diet,"the way the body positivity movement got completely hijacked by fitness culture will just,,, never sit right with me. how in less than ten years, we went from ‘extreme thinness is the gold standard for attractiveness’ to 'over-developed muscle mass on top of extreme thinness is the gold standard for attractiveness AND health’. surely that makes it better, no doubt",look,"LET’S TALK ABOUT SEEING PROGRESS & RESULTS ON YOUR WEIGHT LOSS / WEIGHT GAIN / HEALTH JOURNEY... 💪🏼

Whether your goal is to lose weight, maintain your weight, gain fat, gain muscle, create a healthier relationship with food, increase your strength, run 5km, workout more, etc... It’s pretty fair to say that most of us seek ‘progress’ within the first couple of weeks of changing our lifestyles. BUT, change takes time. Swipe across to watch me explain the paper towel analogy... It explains the process of progress perfectly! Especially if you’re a visual learner! 👏🏻

The top left photo was from the start of my weight loss journey — there’s an entire year between the first and last photo.... and 6 months between me reaching my lowest weight (Aug 2019) & working towards reaching a healthier weight again & gaining some weight back. If I gave up on my journey because I wasn’t seeing results a few weeks in, I never would’ve made it to the point I’m at now. Seeing results & a significant change doesn’t happen overnight, but it ✨ WILL ✨ happen. So no matter what your goals are, KEEP GOING! 

Here’s a few things that WON’T ruin your progress:
- 1 day of overeating
- 1 ‘bad’ meal (no food is BAD, there’s only LESS nutritious or MORE nutritious foods, both are fine to eat!)
- Missing a workout
- Having a rest day
- Exceeding your macro goals for the day
- Not hitting your step goal
- Cutting your workout short

+ WAAAY more!

Ask yourself, “what makes living a healthier lifestyle so hard?” and then once you’ve written them down, come up with some solutions to make it a lil easier & enjoyable for yourself!!! And remember, be PATIENT and CONSISTENT. You’ve got this! The only way you’ll fail is if you give up 💪🏼

Now ask yourself, “What if I wake up in 10 years time still terrified of food?” 
Which is worse? 🤔

Secondly, high calorie / untracked meals DON’T equal weight gain. Eating at a caloric surplus consistently = weight gain. So let’s just get that outta the way! 💪🏼

Significant weight changes don’t happen overnight. It takes eating an excess of 3,850 calories on top of the amount of calories your body burns to gain a mere 0.5kg of body weight which is usually distributed across your entire body... So no you won’t wake up 10kgs heavier after overeating for a day or two. In fact, you really won’t notice a physical difference at all!

When you do overeat, you may notice some initial temporary changes such as bloating & puffiness, but this is the body’s natural response to receiving extra energy & it will go away after a few days! So don’t go into a frenzy where you start punishing your body, eating less & working out more... Just ride the wave & give your body some time! ✨

When you eat intuitively, it’s normal for your physique & weight to fluctuate because you’ll unintentionally overeat or under-eat sometimes, but so long as you’re making healthy, balanced choices overall, it’ll likely balance out in the end. If it doesn’t & you end up seeing changes you’re not 100% comfortable with, that’s okay too!

Weight gain doesn’t make you a failure, there’s nothing wrong with fuelling & nourishing your body well! It doesn’t happen overnight, just like weight loss doesn’t happen overnight. So yes, you can tweak your eating habits slightly along the way to suit your goals, but there’s so much more to life than counting calories & fearing weight gain. Trust your body & enjoy your life 💛

This information is what has helped me have a more flexible & realistic approach to health & nutrition, so I hope it helps you too 🥰

#nutrition #highcalorie #intuitiveeating #weightgain #foodfreedom",gain,"✨ weight-focused VS health-focused ✨

Photos like these can only really reflect the changes that have happened externally, but the mental changes are where most of the magic happens 👇🏻

When I was obsessed with my weight, I experienced:
❌ period loss
❌ food guilt
❌ thinking about food all the time 
❌ weighing myself at least once a week 
❌ weighing all of my meals
❌ fear of dining out / eating anything I couldn’t track
❌ ignoring my hunger cues
❌ fear of increasing my food intake
❌ seeing exercise as punishment & something I HAD to do
❌ fear of weight gain
❌ obsessive thoughts about my body & being slim
❌ fear of ‘losing control’

When I started focusing on my overall health & living a more balanced lifestyle, I:
✨ recovered my cycle
✨ dine out at least once a week & order whatever I want from the menu 🤤
✨ maintain my physique while still enjoying the foods I love & crave!
✨ learned that weight gain only happens if you eat in a calorie surplus & significant weight changes don’t happen in a week
✨ accept that my body WILL change & my weight will fluctuate
✨ listen to my hunger cues
✨ live my life without the all-consuming thoughts about food
✨ exercise in the ways I enjoy! If I don’t feel like doing squats on leg day, I swap it out ☺️
✨ stopped weighing my food & myself 
✨ increased my food intake from 1,600 cals to 2,500 very gradually over time — at my own pace!
✨ feel so much more confident & FREE now

These changes didn’t happen overnight, it takes time to ‘rewire’ your mindset. So please be patient with yourself. Don’t rush your process, do it at your own pace! Whatever your goals are, remember that your physical AND mental health is a priority & can be maintained while you’re working towards those goals! 💛

P.s. I’m not saying that weight loss is a bad thing, but weight loss at the detriment of your health is. You don’t need to ‘punish’ your body into a shape you’ll love, it’s possible to enjoy the process while working towards those goals!

The “all or nothing” mindset is not it. 

Having a sustainable, balanced, long-term approach to your lifestyle is what will last. The key to being truly healthy, happy & feeling fit is to create healthy habits, not restrictions. You don’t have to be extreme, just consistent! A healthy lifestyle should add to your life, not take things away from it 💐 

First of all, I’ve learned that health & fitness isn’t what I first thought it was… It’s NOT:
👉 all or nothing
👉 eating small amounts of food
👉 a quick, overnight, easy fix
👉 working out for hours every single day
👉 very low body fat
👉 ignoring hunger cues 
👉 sweating as much as possible
👉 weighing myself every morning 
👉 forcing myself to say “no”
👉 filling my mind with unkind, harsh, restrictive thoughts about my body, diet & routine

What I’ve learned is that a healthy lifestyle & werkin’ on my fitness isn’t actually about a certain body shape, for me it’s about the state of my mind & quality of life… 

⭐️ when I’m taking care of my body
⭐️ creating sustainable habits
⭐️ nourishing my body well
⭐️ allowing it to rest
⭐️ feeling strong
⭐️ accepting that my body has fat & my weight will fluctuate
⭐️ focusing on how I FEEL rather than how I look
⭐️ actually enjoying exercise
⭐️ eating nutrient-dense foods, but also sometimes just eating plain yummy foods that offer no real nutritional value 
⭐️ letting go of guilt & unnecessary stress
⭐️ appreciating what my body does for me
⭐️ saying “YES” more… YES let’s go out for dinner, YES a hike sounds great, YES I’ll have some dessert, YES I GET to workout today (instead of “I have to”), YES my body has changed a little & YES that’s okay! 

That’s when I feel my healthiest, fittest & BEST 💪🏼 

Remember, it’s not a short-term thing, there’s no finish line or end date… So make healthy choices / additions to your lifestyle that you love & can maintain FOREVER 🥰

Leave a “💪🏼” in the comments if ur a healthy queen, do it for the accountability — remember it all starts in the mind!! 😉👑

#healthjourney #nutrition #healthylifestyle #fitness #fitnessmotivation #healthmotivation #balanceiskey",less,"If your endeavour to reach your “goal body” causes your mental or physical health to decline, it’s time to reevaluate 👀💡 

So many of us assume that if you’re on a diet, you MUST be healthier because we’ve all been told that diets = healthy. This isn’t true.

At the beginning, I wasn’t eating enough, I was exercising too much & losing weight too fast = losing my period, feeling dizzy & irritable all the time, constantly thinking about food, losing feeling in my right leg from the knee down, obsessing over my body. Doesn’t sound very healthy or sustainable, does it? 😅

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not *against* working on yourself/your body, but it’s so so important to approach it in a sustainable, flexible, balanced way. For me, learning to accept your body & be kind to yourself should be the first step before you decide to do that. Watch how different your approach to health & fitness becomes once you start looking after your body because you love it, not because you hate it.

This is why I share so much about how to reach your goals in a HEALTHY way. I never want you guys to get stuck down the rabbithole I was in.

If you’re someone who has lost your period, I thought I’d also share how I recovered mine:

✨ ensure you’re eating enough
✨ allow your body to rest, rest & recovery days are important!
✨ carbs, fats & proteins are all important, so if you’re cutting any of those out, your body is going to feel that & respond accordingly.
✨ if you’re underweight, it’s likely your body doesn’t have enough energy to go through your hormonal cycle each month —having enough fat on your body is necessary for optimal health — I personally had to gain some weight back in order to get my body back to a healthy condition.
✨ you’re not alone, PLEASE reach out to your support system. You’ve got this 💪🏼

Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same.

I mentioned last week that I was going to do yoga live on YouTube, however I got a bit caught up with everything and didn’t manage to get it done. Instead (and in the mean time, because I don’t like not keeping promises!) I’ve re-worked this video that I originally made for the StudyTube project.

Guys I am officially a Cambridge BLUE 😱 Ok so to many of you that means completely nothing, but it means quite a lot to me and the rest of the dance squad 💙 Essentially, students at Cambridge and Oxford can be awarded blues status for competing at the highest level in a particular sport. Now I’ve never really seen dance as a sport shall we say, however just because we ‘prance’ around in leotards and pink tights does NOT mean we don’t work our little booties off training, perfecting routines, stretching .... you know the drill. We might not be as macho as rugby players or have biceps like rowers, but that does not mean dancers should not qualify for blues.
•
So as I’ve alluded to above, many sports teams automatically get blues for their whole team. Every single member in many cases will get a blue. That includes rowing for example (standard 😑) but also the cheerleaders (who qualified last year) and what is called ‘dance sport’ in Cambridge (which I think is ballroom). HOWEVER our competition team STILL does not qualify for blues status. Ok we haven’t competed in five varsity matches yet, which is another requirement apparently (🙄) but what is most frustrating for us is that, how can cheerleading and ballroom get blues and we can’t? They are so similar!?!
•
I’m sorry for the rant, but I am still not done 😂 ..... Now you’re probably wondering, how did I get a blue, along with two other of my dance gals? Essentially, we had to apply for ‘extraordinary’ blues. We all had to fill in an application and then present them to the blues committee. Pretty intimidating. I wasn’t there, but I thank @myzteriouspeach and @bethhermi 🙌🏻
•
Next year the competition team should be able to apply for full blues status because we will have then competed in five varsity matches. However I don’t think it’s going to be easy getting blues for at least 40 people who are on the competition team 😅😢 We’ve got to try though, and keep making progress in getting dance officially recognised as a competitive ART FORM ✨ It is more than just a sport you know 😏👯‍♀️",definitely,"Hello friends 👋🏻 First post coming at ya from down unda (say with an Australian accent please 😉)

This was a travel day for us heading North to Pai from Chiang Mai, so whilst we didn’t do much exploring, I still had amazing Thai food (not all shown), watched an incredible sunset and this journey along Route 1095 is pretty intense . . . it’s an 80km road with 762 bends 😅🙈 I didn’t feel amazing by the end of it, but I kept my mind occupied by listening to Climate of Change - an Audible original podcast with 6 episodes all about global climate issues 🌎🌿

You guys know I’m always absorbing new information by listening to different podcasts, and Audible is so so good because it has the world's largest selection of titles so there is always something for everyone!! Climate of Change, in particular, is available for you to listen now on Audible and I’ve found it to be a really inspiring and grounding series will lots of current information and opinions centred on tackling the climate crisis. I especially love podcasts that interview guests, and this one brings loads of stories to life, including those from Prince William himself 👌🏻

These travel days getting from A to B are definitely the less glamorous sides to backpacking, but it’s all part of the big adventure and one of the best things about travelling is that every day is *completely* different 🤩 Shoutout again to @audible_UK for working with me on this post, and definitely follow along for more of Holly in Thailand . . . with Matthew, of course, almost always sleeping 😂

Not boarding a flight and losing money would have been a definite no no, and backpacking with friends I’ve met whilst travelling would have never. even. crossed. my. mind!!! But right now I couldn’t be more excited, and I mean, it’s the beauty of an adventure, right? 🙈🤩
