I know if I reached out to her she would reply, but I\u2019m not in crisis so I think I can get my adult self to take care of little me - while still accepting that it\u2019s ok to wish T were here to do it.  Times like this bring up the paradox and limits of the therapy relationship. I had to get attached to my therapist in order to let my defences down and do the deep healing work. But then that attachment only gets seen for 50 mins a week, and the rest of the week I have to cope with it on my own *sigh*. Not fair."},{"Description":"doc3","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc3","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Therapy 05.05.20 \/\/ after the bombshell  I managed to not completely shut down. T explained that she\u2019d put a statement on her website about not taking new clients - she wondered if I\u2019d seen it - and she just felt very aware that it was out there but it had gone unspoken between us, and so she wanted to bring it up so we could talk about it.  I had seen her statement, but I\u2019d presumed she just wasn\u2019t taking any new clients during lockdown because it was difficult to start a new therapeutic relationship online. So I hadn\u2019t thought about it any further than that.  T then said lots of lovely things to me. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call it damage limitation, but it was like she\u2019d dropped this bombshell about retiring on me, and now she was quickly trying to catch me before I fell.  \u201cI will never forget you Faith. You will always have a place in my heart. I really enjoy working with you. I do! I never think, oh no I have to see Faith today. You work so hard in therapy and you are always thinking\u2026 working on things. I know it\u2019s a therapeutic relationship that we have, but you can\u2019t have a real therapeutic relationship without having some elements of a normal relationship too. That\u2019s the privilege of a therapeutic relationship. In fact, it can be deeper than a normal relationship because you have the boundaries in place to make it safe to go deeper than you usually would be able to.\u201d I listened to her and tried to let myself absorb all her words. The battle between shutting down or staying present was still going to and fro inside me. Gradually as she kept talking, repeating the same things, her voice soothed me and I started to feel calmer internally. After T had stopped talking, there was a pause. \u201cSo, what\u2019s going on in your head now?\u201d I think I said something about how at least if T made the decision to end therapy, then I wouldn\u2019t feel regret for ending therapy myself. What if I decided to end, and then something happened and I needed T again. I\u2019d be kicking myself. Whereas this way I would know I\u2019d had no choice. T squinted at me and said she wasn\u2019t sure that was very therapeutic. To be honest, I think I felt a little bit gleeful. Maybe it\u2019s not therapeutic but it\u2019s what you\u2019ve done T. I said I felt a little bit stubborn, \u201cWell, now I don\u2019t have to make the decision myself about when to end\u201d. T looked at me thoughtfully and said \u201chmm I think that\u2019s important\u2026 I\u2019m not sure right now quite how, I\u2019ll have to have a think about it\u2026\u201d  We were coming to the end of the session and T said \u201cI get the feeling that you were about an 8 or a 9 in terms of having a wobble when I told you, but how would you feel now?\u201d I considered, \u201cMaybe a 4 or 5\u201d \u201cOk that\u2019s good, it\u2019s come down a bit then. Was I accurate in saying an 8 or a 9?\u201d \u201cUh\u2026 yes\u2026 and I was having a wobble too in that I was nearly shutting down\u2026. A few years ago I would have completely shut down for the rest of the session if you told me something like that.

Do you ever feel like there's two versions of you in therapy (adult vs child) and that they're responding two different ways?  I emailed my therapist that I had made the dean's list (3.5+ GPA (Or A-B average)) this semester and she told me that I did really good and that that was amazing.  The week before (we're every other week right now and I see her Tuesday) we talked about how I have such a hard time with praise (can't be praised\/praise myself for what is 'expected' of me because parents always discounting my achievements, etc (long trauma history for me of emotional abuse from them, some still ongoing).  My adult self didn't respond to her email but tonight I'm feeling very emotional and vulnerable and I want to send her an email apologizing and saying she shouldn't have responded because I'm supposed to make dean's list and that I'm sorry for bothering her and that I'm sorry if I'm too much.  Adult me stopped me from sending it.  What do I do?  Do I send the email?  Why do I feel like this?  It feels so stupid. Answer: Hi anon, sorry I know I am very slow replying to this message. What did you do? Did you send the email?Yes I very often feel like there\u2019s two versions of me in therapy, the adult and the child. Sometimes when T is saying something to me that makes my adult self squirm or want to discount, such as praise, I try and quiet that part of my mind and think \u201clet the child in me hear this\u201d. And I sit and listen and absorb what T is saying and believe that some part of me deep down is taking it in even if that other noisy bit of my brain is thinking bah! this isn\u2019t for you! It\u2019s kind of like stepping out of my own way and letting T in to do stuff in my brain. A person has to build up enough trust in their therapist to allow them to do that though.We feel like this because as children we got wrong or mixed messages that we made sense of the best way we could but that weren\u2019t right. Now those beliefs aren\u2019t serving us well and can get in our own way, so if we want to be free to live more authentic lives we need to undo those false beliefs and replace them with true ones."},{"Description":"model","Type":"Custom","Field":"model","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"bertopic"},{"Description":"topic_id","Type":"Custom","Field":"topic_id","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"3"},{"Description":"NPMI","Type":"Custom","Field":"NPMI","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"0.09584414458054"}]},{"Type":"EmbeddedData","FlowID":"FL_224","EmbeddedData":[{"Description":"top_terms","Type":"Custom","Field":"top_terms","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"going, hope, life, myself, happy, solo, be, day, definitely, you"},{"Description":"doc1","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc1","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Happy (F)easter if you celebrate it.  \n I was raised in the church but I\u2019m not religious now.

And that means I\u2019m working to beat my previous time, run faster, or run a longer distance. Challenging myself with running has made it so much more exciting and rewarding.\n-\n003 \/\/ I think everyone\u2019s probably heard of endorphins. With any form of exercise you get that positive feeling afterwards, but for me, endorphins are on an all time high after I run.\n-\n004 \/\/ Stress relief. At my desk, there\u2019s a million-and-one things going on inside my head all at the same time. Whilst on a run, it\u2019s a chance for me to escape that chaotic bubble and just be in my own company.\n-\n005 \/\/ Running is for anyone and everyone. For sure you have to train pretty intensely to be a pro runner like Mo Farah, but it\u2019s so easy to just put on some trainers and run. And simply run for fun. I also love running to explore and find new places, which is something I loved doing in Australia (except in Darwin . . . yeah, about that \ud83d\ude2d\ud83c\udfe5).\n-\nHappy Monday my friends.

I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. \u201cNo matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.\u201d After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn\u2019t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that \u201cok Faith, time is up\u201d, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she\u2019d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. \u201cNo Faith, you don\u2019t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -\u201c I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we\u2019ve been connected. \u201cOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don\u2019t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.\u201d I said \u201cUh ok\u2026 I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don\u2019t say anything, I know I just keep going.\u201d T smiled, like she knows that\u2019s exactly what I do. \u201cBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.\u201d I thought for a moment and said \u201cSo\u2026uh\u2026 that\u2019s likely what I\u2019m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I\u2019m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop.

Omg no\u2026 slow down T! I\u2019m not ready to go there. \u201cNo! I\u2019m just telling you that if you\u2019re waiting for me to do it, I probably won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we\u2019ll have year from then to process our ending. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you\u2019ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s all very well, but I hope she knows I\u2019m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life.

There have been some issues with the contact sessions and some issues with inappropriate text message contact since birth parents have had to have my phone number. In amongst all my other wailing in therapy, T asked me how the baby was, and that got me started on the issues I\u2019ve been having with her parents. I hadn\u2019t really intended to bring these issues up in therapy because in themselves they\u2019re not a big deal. They need resolving practically which I can take to my supervisors to do. And I know it\u2019s ok to have my boundaries around them, I just need to be sure that I\u2019m not overstepping my authority in the boundaries that I set. But anyway, I was on a roll and the words all just tumbled out of my mouth. \u201cThey send me messages and pictures late at night, and in itself that\u2019s not really a problem. I just don\u2019t open the message\u2026.. even if I go on WhatsApp, I just don\u2019t go into that conversation\u2026. but it makes me think\u2026 uh\u2026 it makes me think, is that what it\u2019s like for you?\u201d Thankfully T understood what I was asking. \u201cHmm are you saying, that you feel exasperated with them for sending messages, and you wonder if I feel exasperated with you?\u201d \u201cUh not so much exasperated, it doesn\u2019t bother me too much. I just think I\u2019ll leave their message till the morning. But it makes me internally roll my eyes a bit and think what are they sending me that for??\u2026..

Yet here I am unplanned, spilling these feelings out. T replied \u201cMmm I hear what you\u2019re saying, but baby\u2019s parents are not sticking to any boundaries. Whereas I feel that you have always been respectful of my time and of the boundaries. There\u2019s only been a handful of times in what\u2026 7? 8?\u2026 years of us working together where you\u2019ve messaged me and I\u2019ve felt like that.\u201d T smiled at me reassuringly. \u201cYou do respect the boundaries, Faith.\u201d  I feel a bit reassured but I\u2019m still uncertain. I had a real fear when I noticed my feelings about birth parents randomly messaging me, that what if this is what T feels when I message her? I don\u2019t know what would be worse, her feeling angry or frustrated with me for messaging out of session, or her just feeling this blank indifference with me similar to what I notice I feel about the birth parents\u2019 messages. \u201cFaith I just need to tell you that it\u2019s 9.45am [5 minutes to go] \u2026. but I think this is important, I think we need to come back to it.

It\u2019s not a boundary issue that\u2019s bothering me, I\u2019m happy to set my boundaries with the birth parents and to check that out with my supervisor. It\u2019s more about projecting how I felt onto how T feels. T asked me if I came to therapy today planning to say all this - \u201cWas this what you wanted to talk about, or did it just come up?\u201d I said it kind of just came up.

Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the \u201chighlights\u201d (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news.

This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a 24\/7 news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating\/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don\u2019t understand the American people a lot of the time.

I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. \u201cNo matter how many 5 or 10 minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.\u201d After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn\u2019t keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a 5 minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that \u201cok Faith, time is up\u201d, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she\u2019d said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. \u201cNo Faith, you don\u2019t do that. I know we do often go over by 5 or 10 minutes -\u201c I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go 10 minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we\u2019ve been connected. \u201cOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by 10 minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don\u2019t mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.\u201d I said \u201cUh ok\u2026 I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don\u2019t say anything, I know I just keep going.\u201d T smiled, like she knows that\u2019s exactly what I do. \u201cBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.\u201d I thought for a moment and said \u201cSo\u2026uh\u2026 that\u2019s likely what I\u2019m going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I\u2019m just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop.

Omg no\u2026 slow down T! I\u2019m not ready to go there. \u201cNo! I\u2019m just telling you that if you\u2019re waiting for me to do it, I probably won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we\u2019ll have year from then to process our ending. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you\u2019ll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s all very well, but I hope she knows I\u2019m not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life.

I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I\u2019d written down. But although they\u2019d felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don\u2019t think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn\u2019t get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren\u2019t really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn\u2019t find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were \u2018generational\u2019, did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn\u2019t believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn\u2019t feel like it did. I said that I don\u2019t feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I\u2019m not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don\u2019t need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we\u2019d got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I\u2019d believed when we started therapy\u2026 I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after 3 years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it\u2019s not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a \u201cmaybe\u201d face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born\u2026 and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]\u2026 and it\u2019s like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily.

I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don\u2019t know why when she brings it up, it\u2019s always at the end of a session. It\u2019s risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn\u2019t want to push aside the stuff I\u2019m bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I\u2019d been thinking that maybe this year would be the year.

Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.\u201d T says she doesn\u2019t remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn\u2019t the same supervisor as the one that didn\u2019t like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for 6 years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That\u2019s because I\u2019d perfected my blank face because I\u2019d learnt it as a child that it wasn\u2019t safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily."},{"Description":"doc5","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc5","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Therapy 19.11.19 \/\/ a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I\u2019d had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is 2.5 years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less \u201ctraumatised\u201d viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and \u2018wrong\u2019 some bits of it were, and the next minute I\u2019m thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I\u2019m just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don\u2019t seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn\u2019t really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn\u2019t connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said \u201cI\u2019m just giving you a warning that we\u2019ve got about 5 minutes left to finish talking about this for today\u201d which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said \u201cCan I just talk about something else?\u201d. We had about 4 minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked \u201cwhat\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they\u2019re not staying with you?\u201d \u201cThey know I\u2019m talking about them in therapy and they don\u2019t like it\u201d I replied.  T looked at me.\u201dYeah\u2026. that\u2019s magical thinking. How would they know?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just what I think! Why else wouldn\u2019t they come? They\u2019ve always stayed with us before.\u201d T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they\u2019ve suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. \n Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn\u2019t feel like we\u2019d achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we\u2019d been talking about the week before."},{"Description":"model","Type":"Custom","Field":"model","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"stm"},{"Description":"topic_id","Type":"Custom","Field":"topic_id","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"2"},{"Description":"NPMI","Type":"Custom","Field":"NPMI","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"0.0770423459604391"}]},{"Type":"EmbeddedData","FlowID":"FL_254","EmbeddedData":[{"Description":"top_terms","Type":"Custom","Field":"top_terms","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"support, eating, disorders, alliance, please, help, recovery, #edrecovery, disorder, #notonemore"},{"Description":"doc1","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc1","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"In honor of #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth, it is imperative that we bring eating disorders to the forefront of the conversation.

I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else\u2019s body is an invitation for them to judge it. \n\nBut have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can\u2019t possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? \n\nTo be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of \u201coh, they\u2019re human!\u201d or \u201cyay, she looks like me!\u201d And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.\n\nSo I\u2019m leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn\u2019t always as it seems.

When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently\u2026\n \nYou might realise there\u2019s actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you\u2019ve followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn\u2019t your lack & that maybe, you\u2019re only seeing what society deems \u201cInsta-worthy\u201d or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they\u2019re scrolling through socials too.\n\nFor e.g: in the 1st photo, I used to believe the left made a \u201cgood\u201d photo & the right made a \u201cbad\u201d one. The only difference is that I\u2019m flexing \/ posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I\u2019ve STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it\u2019s hardly fair to accept one & not the other.\n\nI know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would\u2019ve worked by now.

There\u2019s always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. \u201cSooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week\u2019s list\u2026. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected\u2026.\u201d \u201cAh ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?\u201d I laughed and shook my head and told her I don\u2019t have a list this week, it\u2019s been too mad and I\u2019m too tired to even think about a list. \u201cOk so do you want to talk about the thing you didn\u2019t get on to last week?\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026. so\u2026 uh I just wanted to check in that\u2026 uh\u2026 so I had this list we were talking about\u2026 and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe 6 weeks ago\u2026 and I guess I wanted to check that\u2026. you know how we got here?\u201d T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said \u201chmm\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re asking me?\u201d She thought a moment and said \u201cMy recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don\u2019t want you to feel trapped in it, like with d1 about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she\u2019s grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you\u2019ve given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She\u2019s almost ahead of you\u2026. when you were a child you didn\u2019t get enough emotional regulation and so you\u2019re still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you\u2019ve pretty much got that now. Now you\u2019re learning to do a similar thing with your emotions\u2026. That\u2019s my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?\u201d I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she\u2019ll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said \u201cEr, no.\u201d T smiled. \u201cOk, well that\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok for us both to see things from different angles.\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026 I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.\u201d T waited. \u201cGo on! take the plunge\u201d, she encouraged. It\u2019s annoying because I\u2019ve got it all written out, so I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m struggling for words. They\u2019re all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I\u2019m closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that\u2019s when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she\u2019d forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn\u2019t remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you\u2019ve picked it up again. T replied, \u201cYes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I\u2019ve had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -\u201c  (don\u2019t tell me what it is don\u2019t tell me what it is don\u2019t tell me what it is)  \u201c- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It\u2019s ok for us to \u201cmiss\u201d each other sometimes, because that\u2019s what happens in relationships. It\u2019s life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it\u2019s ok for you to tell me if you think I\u2019m losing track, that\u2019s ok, that\u2019s your responsibility to do that.\u201d  Ummm I know it\u2019s my responsibility, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it now?? Anyway, I said \u201cUh uh. But I\u2019m not mad. I just want to know that you know where we\u2019re up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult\u2026. and I don\u2019t really want to have to say all that again.\u201d"},{"Description":"doc3","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc3","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Therapy 3.11.20 \/\/ struggling to speak   I\u2019m struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I\u2019d written down. But although they\u2019d felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don\u2019t think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn\u2019t get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren\u2019t really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn\u2019t find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were \u2018generational\u2019, did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn\u2019t believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn\u2019t feel like it did. I said that I don\u2019t feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I\u2019m not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don\u2019t need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we\u2019d got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I\u2019d believed when we started therapy\u2026 I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after 3 years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it\u2019s not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a \u201cmaybe\u201d face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born\u2026 and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]\u2026 and it\u2019s like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break."},{"Description":"doc4","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc4","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Therapy 23.01.20 \/\/ third session in a row talking about termination  We had spent a lot of the session talking about food and weighing, although in a constructive way, not arguing. I remember T saying once that when I push her into a position of having to take authority on food, it makes her feel less connected to me. This wasn\u2019t that position, it was more like gentle nudges and encouragement to do what I know I need to do. T really wants me to learn to trust my body and respond to its needs, rather than have a rigid framework imposed from the outside. I\u2019d like this too but as I told her several times, it\u2019s just Really Scary \ud83d\ude31 \u201cAnyway, I know you don\u2019t like to spend the whole session talking about food, so what shall we use the rest of the time to talk about?\u201d This was when I realised that we were a lot further through the session than I thought we were. T said we could take a bit of extra time at the end so I bravely brought up ending again. This is three weeks in a row we\u2019ve talked about termination, which is quite a massive step, because until now it\u2019s been enough for T to even just mention it and me to freak out. I can now approach the subject myself. I told T that I felt a bit bashed about. She had talked about retiring as if it were going to happen soon, and then the next week said she had no plans to retire. T clarified that she has cut down her working days and stopped taking referrals from a certain place, and with those in place, she is not planning to retire any time soon. I told her that the thought of ending therapy felt like a big black hole opening up inside of me, and I thought I could do it but now we\u2019ve talked about it and made it feel a little more real, I don\u2019t think I can. T said it was ok, and for now we were just thinking about it. It feels like exposure therapy. Ok Faith, first you learnt to tolerate the mention of termination, and next step, you can tolerate a conversation about hypothetical termination, and let\u2019s hold it at that level for now till it feels comfortable enough to move on. T said \u201cOne thing is for certain, I will never forget you!\u201d I burst out laughing at that and said \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad!\u201d but secretly I was very pleased that T brought it up and said it so confidently.  She said it was definitely good. I know I am her longest term therapy client, and we have been on a real huge meaningful therapy journey together, and I feel for both of us that has given us an experience we haven\u2019t had and won\u2019t have with anyone else. I\u2019ve pushed her skills to the limit sometimes and I\u2019ve probably caused her as many issues in supervision as I\u2019ve had issues with ruptures and behaviours and all that. T talked again about our relationship and said \u201cWe have had our ups and downs and been through a lot but you have made so much progress\u2026\u2026 You are impossibly different to the person I met with almost eight years ago!\u201d Then she gave me lots of proud smiles. I think I\u2019m done talking about ending for now. It can go back on the back burner for a while. Who knows if 2020 really will be the year I end therapy. It might yet be, or I might be still here five years down the line.

She asked me how I was finding it. I was looking down because I was feeling fed up that she wasn\u2019t really getting me, and I muttered  \u201cIt\u2019s annoying!\u201d I don\u2019t think T expected that because she sounded a bit taken aback and gave a little laugh and said \u201coh\u2026 right, ok\u201d. I smiled too. It actually was a moment of connection in amongst all the disconnect. She said \u201cHow can I be helpful to you? What do you need from me? I want to support the adult part of you to make decisions.\u201d I got frustrated and said \u201cYes but it doesn\u2019t have to be one extreme or the other!\u201d while gesturing extremes with my hands. I understand that T taking the adult role and telling me what to do, while it has a place at times, is only really a stepping stone to enabling me to look after myself more fully. But at the same time when she completely steps back and refuses to get drawn into that adult role, it feels like she has abandoned me. I sat in silence for quite a long time. Lots was happening in my head. I was feeling frustrated about how things were going. I was wondering why she hadn\u2019t asked about my weight, when we have spent so many sessions talking about it and even last session she spent some time hammering me on eating.  I managed to use the silence quite constructively. I was weighing up in my head whether to just abandon the weight conversation and talk about something else, or whether that would leave things feeling really difficult over my upcoming holiday. I thought to myself, What will be the hardest thing to manage myself next week when I don\u2019t have a session? and the answer came back in my mind that it would be T not knowing my weight and the places my brain\/eating disorder might run off to with that. Eventually I spoke, although I avoided eye contact. \u201cUh\u2026. it bothers me that you still don\u2019t know what I weigh. That I said I was worried about telling you it but now you don\u2019t seem to care whether I tell you it or not! It\u2019s hard for me to tell you it each week and I need to feel like it\u2019s non-negotiable, because that\u2019s sometimes the only way I can make myself write it. So it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to tell you it this week, I was just scared of what you would think.\u201d T said that she could pretty much figure out what my weight is from the other things I said about it. She made a guess and I kind of nodded slowly, till she said \u201clower?\u201d I nodded and she guessed again, correctly this time. I said I didn\u2019t mean it to be that low, I knew I\u2019d missed some meals but I\u2019d also not missed a lot.  \u201cI was honest when I answered your texts about eating. And it did help, you texting me, but then I felt like a terrible person because I implied everything was ok in the texts and then I went and lost a load of weight\u2026.. Here I am, supposed to be in recovery and instead I am making all these choices that aren\u2019t in line with that. I\u2019m a terrible person.\u201d T reminded me that recovery is never a straight line and that it\u2019s normal to have some relapses.  She was very determined not to get all parental on me, and I guess I felt uncomfortable with the changed dynamic and just kept trying to prod her back into it. She offered to text me again through the next fortnight to ask how eating was going, but I didn\u2019t feel like I deserved anymore support so I said no.  Despite all that, we ended the session on a good note. It wasn\u2019t a rupture.

LOL. right. it sucks bc ur trying to decide whether you should hold shit against them or not. bc on one hand theyre neglecting the friendship, but on the other hand people get busy and its not fair to hold being too busy against them. u CAN hold being an absent friend against them tho. busy or not, ppl who care make time for one another. ppl who care make an effort to listen to how you\u2019re doing.. i miss my friends sometimes too, lol. havent talked to my childhood best friend in over a year now. but its for the best. i was patient with them n they all disappointed me. people grow apart naturally, if thats whats happening, try not to let it eat u alive. it means you\u2019re evolving, even if you\u2019re the one stuck at home. im sorry u feel so isolated right now. its not a fun way to feel. the best advice i can give is to focus on refining urself for the time being. keep urself busy becoming a better person. friends come and go and we all evolve\/outgrow people but the next time a friend comes along, you could be the difference in their life. you could be the friend for that person that you\u2019ve been needing all this time. you can be the empathetic ear that makes the time for them, and listens when they need you to. if you can do this for other ppl, it might make u feel a lil better.. and they might return the friendship. dont expect much, tho. ppl r fickle pickles. i try n befriend coworkers n stuff bc it makes me feel better. ppl like to be listened to so if i can just like listen to my coworkers and i mean RLY listen and offer support, they LOVE that and it makes ppl love u, yano. people dont always return the favors, you might not always have someone to go to, but at least you know you\u2019re giving everyone everything you can. you can be your own friend. theres knowledge and wisdom and power in silence. you just gotta get a bit more comfortable with it. being alone isnt the worst thing in the world, especially when you have a vivid interior to keep yourself amused. im glad my blog makes u feel a little better and i hope ur able to feel peaceful n calm this week, hang in there buddy"},{"Description":"doc2","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc2","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"clarinetplayingpenguin: \n\n brightlightshadow: \n\n weightlessboi: \n\n skinniminiaa: \n\nDo it for the..  \n\u201cYou got skinny!\u201d\n\u201cWow I can fit my hand all the way around your wrist\u201d\nJealous stares \nSize XXS and 00 \n\u201cYou can sit on my lap since you\u2019re obviously the lightest\u201d \nBeautiful in anything \n\u201cYou\u2019re so light!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a piggyback ride\u201d \nConfidence in dressing rooms \nBikini body \nDainty wrists \nHip bones \nCollarbones that dip for days \nSlender legs \nThigh gaps \n\u201cYou look like a model!\u201d \n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d \nability to feel confident in your own skin \n\n Rip \n\n I don\u2019t want to be the biggest sibling and the biggest friend.  \n\n \u2018you got skinny!\u2019 is tactless as fuck. people. shouldn\u2019t. say that. \u2018I can fit my hand all the way around your waist\u2019 um if you\u2019re that thin you\u2019re seriously SERIOUSLY ill. like your muscles are wasted away you probably can\u2019t even stand. also who the fuck would just grab your waist like that.

but it was putting me behind in school not having a working laptop or printer. and he handed my brother EVERYTHING he has. for the entirety of his life my brother has been a spoiled brat and all the $$ my dad makes went into my brother\u2019s hobbies and wants and gifts.  \n the last thing i want to sound like is ungrateful because im not. i cant even believe how nice the laptop is, ive wanted an msi forever. obviously i love it but ive had it for a day and im already realizing id rather not even have it just because of the implications of owing him. i cant even fucking stand him. one moment hes reasonable and the next he\u2019s making me want to commit murder because his cognitive dissonance is so thick is suffocates me.  \n so now i have this nice ass laptop that i feel guilty and ashamed of for even having. i feel undeserving. like my only worth is to perform well at school so the family can be at peace knowing im \u201coN tHe riGhT pAtH\u201d. my happiness or my sanity or my interests will never fucking matter or be a good enough reason to earn anything whether it be respect or a laptop. its only ever about how things \u201cSEEM to be going\u201d. so as long as i can SEEM like im doing fine, everything in my dad\u2019s small, dumbass world, are. but im not doing fine. im still self harming. im actually self harming more frequently lately than i have in a long run of years. im still brimming with rage because nobody ever listens to me and when i do speak i get told im wrong and or unwise and or ungrateful and or inexperienced and or just plain fucking stupid. im over it. im sick of trying to appease a bunch of people who make my skin crawl. i dont care if its family and they \u201clove me and want the best for me\u201d. theyre all fucking stuck in their ways with piss and shit for brains and any complaint about unhappiness or discord in the home just gets shut down and band-aid\u2019ed with \u201cbuh buh but!!! scKOOL!!! it will give u sense of PurPosE\u201d \u201cbuh but focus on the GUD IN UR LIFE (which is\u2026 btw..?)\u201d \u201cbuh buh heres an excuse as to why your grown ass father can act like an immature damaged joke of a human but you\u2019re required to grow personally and gracefully until the point where youve done SO MUCH personal growth that you realize that life is still futile regardless and you eventually snap and off yourself!!!\u201d \n if i kill myself now or if i kill myself down the line the result is just gonna be the same and i dont know why or how i put effort into leading my life anyways and suffering for now when i know in my heart of hearts that i want to go at my own hand and im probably going to still feel the same way no matter how many years pass.  \n \n \n sorry if this bothers anyone or concerns anyone (pls dont b lol) but i have nowhere else to say this and no friends to take this to and my boyfriend is obviously still useless when it comes to providing emotional support so here i am \n \n idk all i can think about is \u201cif u dont eat youll feel better\u201d and i know that ill get some sort of sick sense of satisfaction but i also know how pointless self sabotage is. but when every other aspect of ur life feels sabotaged outside of ur control, then does it rly matter? \n today i havent denied myself any food. i spent the last of the money i had on food. but thats.. thats it.  \n i have no more money rn so i dont even have the means to eat. i wanna be clear here that my dad does NOT pay for everything, he payed for my schooling only (3 classes at a community college, he practically BEGGED me to go) and he purchased me a laptop to aid in my schooling. yes i have a financial safety net (tbh if ur gonna MAKE kids thats kinda ur job until theyre self sufficient but anyways) im still responsible for feeding and taking care of my animals and myself and paying all my own bills, electricity included. so yeah. food is lookin like a no go right now.  \n i have a 4 hour class tomorrow from 6 to 10 pm. im gonna see if i can make it through the day without eating because once i feed myself THEN i get hungry. if i just abstain entirely i can get over the hunger.  \n i have noticeably gained weight and i am extremely uncomfortable in my body right now. im used to my stomach being perfectly flat and now i have a bit of body fat on me so i feel like ive been spilling out of my pants the past few weeks. its not a good feeling. i have no means to comfort myself rn so maybe getting my body back to how im used to it being will bring me comfort. i always thought i wanted to put on a few lbs and fill out more but now that i have i feel totally out of place in my skin. i hate having to be hyperaware of sucking my stomach in. once you get used to having a flat stomach i guess you take it for granted. the self consciousness and a lack of funds for food have me feelin like this week is about to be a long one. theyre all long. i just want a break. i just want to feel happy and comfortable with my life and with my plants situation and my decisions but im not gonna while im living here. im gonna be stuck in this shitty ass spot for as long as it takes for me to get through college, hone an entire craft that idek if im passionate about, and then find another 9 to 5 thatll probably have more cons than pros to showing up and wasting away at for 8 hours a day even if im \u201cdoing what i love\u201d. what i love is to go about my life unbothered. what i would love, is to not have to participate in this rat race at all. what if i dont want to have a purpose. what if ive already accepted my wasted potential and im perfectly happy doing nothing????"},{"Description":"doc4","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc4","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: You\u2019re so nice for always taking the time to

wont be able to pay my bills or take care of my animals.  probably gonna go weigh myself on the way to the garden since the scale is down there. out of morbid curiosity. probably gonna be

brain functioning starts getting inhibited. doesnt feel good. 100 lbs, and im unhappy because i feel too squishy and slow. it takes a lot of fucking food to even get to that point, which makes me feel gluttonous n awful because i loathe the feeling of food digesting especially lots of it at once. i tell myself weight gain is what i want, and then ultimately it just doesnt feel right. and then everything else in between, i still feel unsettled in my own skin. ill tell myself i need to gain, and then i do, and i hate it. so ill lose, and ill hate that too. theres no winning. i wish proanas ( even the ones who dont realize they are ) would shut the fuck up and listen to what i have to say for once. i wish people understood that they dont actually want this. what you see on the surface of

Half of high school was awful food-wise, but for most of college (except the summer) I really felt like I was cured. I approached food as something I needed to stay full during classes, and dining halls were only open during certain hours so I had three meals a day, of food already prepared for me. And, I walked around a lot\u2014I was a lot more active throughout a normal day. I remember still comparing my body with other girls\u2019 bodies, and comparing plates, but for the most part, I really just didn\u2019t care. I ate to stay full, and I ate only what I wanted (dining hall food was mediocre on any given day, anyways). I was also around friends every day, and was studying and working almost constantly. And I ended college comfortable in my body, satisfied enough with my weight, and relatively stable mentally. The only times I relapsed to bingeing were when I thought that I could try to drop my weight further (usually brought on by seeing other people who lost weight, or being around athletes, as was common at my college).\u00a0 So rather than focus on everything that I\u2019ve read and watched about how to cure binge eating, I\u2019m going to use my own experiences to tailor a plan for myself for September. For accountability, here are my main goals:  1. Have three solid, filling meals a day, with small snacks as needed. Essentially, replicate my college meal plan experience.\u00a0 Breakfast was usually around 8:15, and was a latte and bagel\/cream cheese. The latte was sipped over the course of a couple of hours. (Looking back, I never even thought about the calories in the bagel\/latte combo\u2014I just ate\u00a0it. God I miss when I wasn\u2019t so fixated on food.)Lunch would usually be about four hours later, around 12:30. I would try and grab a variety of stuff (ah, how I took the variety of prepared food for granted). Usually some greens\/coleslaw, plus some tofu or chik\u2019n nuggets and some other vegetable side. So I guess it ended up being protein and veggies, with a cookie or two for dessert.Dinner would be similar to lunch, but more substantial, and usually around 5-6pm. More protein, more veggies, but also more carbs like bread and butter, rice, or sometimes pasta. Sometimes I\u2019d add a side salad too. I\u2019d usually still have some kind of dessert, either a slice of cake or cookie or a bowl of cereal.\u00a0In between meals, I might have an apple that I took from the dining hall, or small snacks like goldfish or dry cereal. But for the most part, that was about it. Looking back, it looks like a lot of food, but a) I was more active then than I am now and b) I regularly eat way more than that in my binges, but I binge on snack food so it doesn\u2019t seem like the same amount of food. That\u2019s the most ridiculous part: I could be eating comparative or fewer calories now as I used to, but the food could be so much better, and yet my stupid animal brain wants to continually get high off of snacks upon snacks upon snacks. 2. Be more active. In college, I usually got up to at least 8000 to 9000 steps a day, and some days way exceeded that. So now, I want to make more of an effort to go out and move. I would sometimes go to the gym in college (not possible now, thanks corona), but for the most part, it was just walking anyways.I\u2019d like to get into the habit of occasional morning walks. Evening walks are nice too, but there\u2019s more people out and in NYC that makes me anxious. For now, I only go to work once a week, so there\u2019s only one day a week where I consistently get to 8000-9000 steps. I can usually convince myself to leave my apartment on weekends, so I try and get extra steps then, but I\u2019m still lagging far behind where I was. So, I need to find a way to get walking into my routine. 3. Stop bingeing. Stop bingeing for real. I cannot live like this. Food cannot keep occupying my every thought. It\u2019s taking up so much of my energy that it\u2019s hard to find other things to enjoy and focus on. I cannot keep bingeing. It is not sustainable; it is bad for me physically, mentally, and emotionally.\u00a0I read through The Fuck It Diet\u00a0and Brain Over Binge\u00a0recently. I think both ultimately boil down to getting rid of food restriction and eating adequately and allowing yourself to feel uncomfortable emotions. I plan to reread Brain Over Binge\u00a0because I\u2019m too concerned about the weight gain that The Fuck It Diet\u00a0seems to promise (horrible, I know, but maybe one day I\u2019ll get over it). Brain Over Binge resonated with me, too, and I think it will be better to focus on the steps that Hanson outlines.\u00a0 4. Find new ways to spend time that are not revolved around food, weight, dieting, etc. College was busy to say the least. I\u2019m trying to branch out and find new things to enjoy. It\u2019s hard when bingeing leads to depressive episodes which suck the fun and the light out of everything, but I\u2019m trying.\u00a0Lately, I\u2019ve been rewatching lots of my favorite TV shows, I\u2019ve started writing fanfiction (somewhat embarrassing, but it\u2019s enjoyable enough), I\u2019ve gotten into commentary youtube channels, and I\u2019m trying to read more.\u00a0Some other things I can incorporate into my every day life: applying for jobs, studying for the GRE and LSAT, journaling, writing letters to friends, taking online courses, studying languages, listening to new music, blogging more regularly, drawing, keeping in contact more with friends and family, etc. The limit does not exist.\u00a0 So I guess that\u2019s about everything. The thing is, I still desperately want to lose weight\u2014I can\u2019t keep spending money on insane amounts of food, I can\u2019t keep buying clothes in bigger and bigger sizes, and I will continue to self-destruct in worse and worse ways if I keep bingeing and my body keeps spreading.\u00a0 BUT I know that weight loss cannot be one of my goals. I\u2019ll hyperfixate on restricting too much, which will only backfire. I have a bluetooth scale, so maybe I\u2019ll try syncing my weight with my phone daily, but I won\u2019t check anything until the end of the month at the earliest.\u00a0 So essentially, my only goals will be to eat adequately, resist the urges to binge, move my body in satisfying ways, and find ways to make life happier.\u00a0 I wish myself luck, and good luck to everyone else out there on this path !"},{"Description":"doc3","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc3","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: You suffered with binge eating disorder? How did you get over it? Answer: toethefinishline:\nOkay. So I am not exactly sure how I beat it- like there is not a simple solution or anything! And it takes time. You will gradually get better and relapse every once in awhile but hopefully you can get to the point i am at today! Binge free for over a year and a half!\nTo start I came to the realization that some days I would be eating 2000-3000 calories all of them processed, sugary, non nutritional, gross foods. And before I had the disorder I would restrict, eating no more than 100-200 calories per day if even that many. So this was a HUGE change for me! I went from 110 pounds to 158 over the 8 months! And from basically no calories per day to a few thousand! It was awful! And I was trying to look good for my vacation so I told myself every day that today is the last day I will binge- tomorrow I will fast! But each day I would try to fast and be consumed by thoughts of food and eating. And it continually got worse! I remember this one specific instance sitting in my last class for the day that had just started and I craved cheese cake. The class dragged on so slowly and I couldn\u2019t concentrate because I just wanted to eat and when I came home I ate the rest of the cheese cake in my freezer and I felt so sick. And I thought \u201cokay. the cheese cake is gone so the temptation is gone and starting now I will fast\u201d but of course dinner came and I found something else to eat! Some nights I would have sugar cravings and I would go to the kitchen get the flour, sugar, vanilla, and water and make a disgusting cookie dough type of thing that was pure sugar and eat it just like that ! it was awful but I just could not control it!\nI finally came to the realization that i didn\u2019t have to fast or diet or restrict to lose weight. I mean I was eating over 2000 calories almost everyday so obviously if I just cut down to 1200 or 1500 (a healthy amount) i would still lose weight. From there I completely switched everything! All of my goals! I no longer wanted skinny. I wanted fit. I redid my tumblr, unfollowed any triggering\/unhealthy blogs and joined the fitblrs(bet decision ever!) And I made some friends and found a weight loss buddy and we made healthy plans together! I made a new grocery list consisting of fruits, veggies, healthy dinners, and little treats. So i would still enjoy myself and not feel deprived. I began exercising again - since i rarely did while i had binge eating disorder. I managed the stress of school by not procrastinating as much and doing my work during lunch and free time in class so when I came home I didn\u2019t have so much to do. And I made new goals for myself. I wanted to become a runner, stop binging, eat healthy by choice, become a weight lifter, to be fit, to have abs, and have better endurance. They are all still my goals and I have only completed a few. this all takes time but the good thing is that my binging has ended.\nI found that once I centered my goals and my life on health- I stopped focusing on the scale and on calorie counting it helped! The numbers do NOT matter! The number I was concerned with was how many days I went binge free! And don\u2019t start by aiming to never binge again! Start small. Go for 2 days, then 4, then 8 - whatever you want! just aim to go longer than you did before!\nWhy I stopped focusing on the scale and calorie counting: The number on the scale does not matter at all ! End of story. It doesn\u2019t measure your self worth or your beauty. It is just a number. There is nothing to it. You need to focus on how you feel and what you eat. I NEVER calorie count anymore because the numbers got way too obsessive for me! I would try to have low sodium, low fat, low carbs, low sugars, but enough calories. and it was impossible! And the days I saw that I had too many of one of those I would be like \u201cfuck it! i have already ruined my day so i will just eat whatever i want\u201d then i would binge! And the days i didn\u2019t eat enough I would try to make dinner larger and then it would be huge and awful and it would make me binge then too! So I stopped counting calories!\nI just made a healthy meal plan of foods that I should try to eat more often: oatmeal, fruits, veggies, green smoothies, luna bars, greek yogurt, eggs, etc. And I started to make a meal plan. Once I got into the habit of the meal plan it would get easier. Some treats I enjoy are soy ice cream and pita chips- I usually have one treat a day and i don\u2019t even portion it typically. I eat what I want and put it away. I figure it is better than what i was doing before and I need to enjoy myself. If you set too many restrictions on yourself you will binge! I tried going vegan but I realized how restrictive that is and it made it really hard so I stopped because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for it and I honestly don\u2019t think I am ready even now after so long. I do NOT diet because I know that I will binge. This is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE. You need to be healthy for you and only for you. So you will feel better and be healthier, as a result you will look better too! But you cannot be doing this for the looks! And you need to realize this won\u2019t happen overnight! You must be patient and be proud of yourself ! It is such a wonderful feeling going days without binging and you will be so proud and the exercise will make you feel great and eating right will too!\nSo for main points:\nDo NOT count calories.\nDo NOT diet\/restrict at all!\nDo NOT weight yourself.\nFind a weight loss buddy.\nDrink lots of water!\nTreat yourself everyday to something you love!\nSet new and healthy goals for yourself!\nFocus on being fit and healthy - not skinny.\nFill your tumblr with healthy motivation!\nYou can even open up to your family and get their help for this! I am sure it would\u2019ve helped if I had told mine but I couldn\u2019t and they still don\u2019t know! But they will be able to support you with healthy eating and maybe even find a nutritionist you can talk to!\nAlso clear out all tempting foods that cause you to binge! I no longer have cheese cake at my house nor do I buy fiber one mocha bars (because my mom would buy them and i would eat one then always eat the whole box. I still don\u2019t trust myself with them so I just leave them at the store! Someone else can enjoy them!).\nI hope this answer helps! I am not sure if it will - let me know if there is anything I didn\u2019t answer or any other way I can help ! I am sorry I kind of rambled but I was trying to cover everything and as I said this is a really hard question to answer!"},{"Description":"doc4","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc4","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"1. Im not a professional. An eating disorder specialist will always know more than me and know whats best. A dietician and a nutritionist will always know more than me and know whats best. 2. Im just a person on the internet. GIANT REPLY TIME:With that out of the way, i will just share what comes to my mind. Rules will not prevent an eating disorder. Eating disorders thrive on rules. There is also no automatic switch to eating normal and the body healing. The body needs time to heal at its own pace and that means we gotta continue the normal eating even when we dont like it, even if we gain some weight, the body needs its time as well as the mind. When the mind heals, the body will follow. We just gotta deal with the bs until then.Eating every few hours isnt bad. That doesnt mean you have to eat a meal every few hours, you could literally have a piece of fruit or some pretzels in between meals. Sometimes i get extra hungry and eat like 5 meals a day. Who cares.  Just munching isnt bad. Some days i have 3 full meals. Some days i sleep in and just graze on snacks all day long. Like who cares. My body will handle it. Yes some medications have an effect on appetite. You can always talk with your medical team about it and see what they suggest. Sometimes i cant tell if im hungry and some times i cant tell if im full. Thats just how it be. Finding a routine can be helpful. Breakfast, snacky, lunch, snacky, dinner. Maybe another snack at night if you feel like it because why not. Eating with other people can be helpful, i tend to go werewolf when i eat alone. With pals i feel more relaxed and less likely to tie my mental and emotional state with my eating. Bro(and\/or sis) never be afraid to speak up about these issues. Ask questions. Talk about concerns. To your family, your friends, your doctors, people who can be there with you in person to help. Literally no reason to face this alone. At all. Maybe consider writing your thoughts and feelings in a journal and tracking whats going on in your life and in your head when you have bad food days. Thats a good first step. You can use that as a guide to talk to a professional about whats happening. Or just to talk to a trusted family member (someone old enough to actually help you)If you feel a need to use behaviors i want to skip meals i want to binge eat etc, ask yourself .. Why?Work on fixing the why and then you wont have the need to use behaviors. The sooner you work on yourself the better. Take care!!!! Good luck! Reach out to others!!! Hit me up if you ever need.

Binge eating isnt about calories, its not about WHAT i eat its HOW i eat it. I can binge eat on fucking ice cubes. I need to address the mental and emotional problems that cause me to binge, not eat at so and so healthy amount or else.

Surprisingly I found that to be very stress-free. We ate all our meals sat outside on cushions round a central \u201cfloor cloth\u201d. Breakfast was a selection of cereals, bread, spreads (including biscoff and Nutella!) and our chef Hassan made porridge for us every day. There was Moroccan tea, coffee, hot chocolate and fruit juice to drink. I had porridge every day with chocolate spread stirred in, and topped with granola. It was so good I usually had two bowls. Great fuel for a morning of walking. Lunch was always bread plus another carb (rice, couscous, pasta, noodles, potatoes), along with a cooked vegetable dish (courgettes, carrots, peppers) and a protein (omelette, beef, mackerel, tinned sardines, lentils) plus slices of cheese and a platter of chopped salad (tomatoes, cucumber, sweetcorn, onion). After lunch we had little glasses of mint tea which I tried to like, but didn\u2019t really. When we arrived in camp after our afternoon trekking, we were greeted with coffee or mint tea and piles of biscuits. Two afternoons Hassan made us these delicious deep-fried bread things, which with a sprinkling of sugar and a bit of jam or spread put in the middle, tasted very much like doughnuts. I managed to eat one both days, I did mentally struggle a bit over it but I didn\u2019t want to miss out. Dinner was three courses starting with bread and soup. The first couple of nights it was harira soup, which we all loved. After that it was a kind of potato soup which we weren\u2019t so keen on. Then the main course was several platters similar to lunch, and dessert was tinned fruit.  It was all (apart from the weird potato soup) really delicious and so impressive considering all the food and cooking equipment had to be carried out into the desert with us. I made sure I ate protein and LOADS of veggies at lunch and dinner, and I always had some bread but I did tend to avoid the other carbs. Not going to lie, knowing I was walking for several hours each day made it feel easier to eat adequately, but mostly eating wasn\u2019t stressful.

I'm not a HUGE burger person (I'm all about that pad Thai baby) so the price isn't a big deal for me as a one time experience. It's a bit pricey for a burger lover who could just go spend $4 on a double double (idk how much they are anymore) though. but to spend $15 on it again would be hard to justify if i already tasted it IMO. Definitely recommend any burger lover to try it regardless!\n\nshould I do ratings? how should I rate my food? hahahah help I\u2019m new"},{"Description":"doc5","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc5","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: Heyy, What do you usually have for lunch or between breakfast and dinner? Sorry if this is annoying I just am kind of lost and never know what to eat..I hate meal prepping but I\u2019m kind of forced to and I never know what to pack for lunch Answer: so i dont really eat 3 meals a day i kinda just.. eat food when im hungry but if im goin out for the day and or night i always pack at least a meal and some snacks. ya girl carries a HUGE backpack for this reason. i love the kind cherry-chocolate-cashew bars, always keep one on me. i love pressed fruit strips too. both stay relatively stable in a bag. if i have access to a fridge during the day ill bring myself a frozen meal that can be microwaved, if i wont have access to a fridge ill bring a room temp stable microwave meal, or a sandwich. my favs r pb&j (js marantha peanut butter with no sugar or salt added is the TITS and only $5 a jar), banana sandwichs (toast bread, one side pb, one side vegan mayo, banana slices in between) MMM OMG theyre the best i swear, or i like to make a sanwich with tofurky smoked deli slices and chao creamy cheez slices, with dijon mustard and vegan mayo. the tofurky sammies r good on sub buns or toasted bread. i like my pb&j\u2019s toasted too. some other good things to keep in ur bag are like fruit cups, i love mandarin oranges and peaches n pears in syrup. gogosqueeze applesauce packets are good in bags also and come in a variety of flavors. u can keep pringles in ur bag bc the tube helps them not smush!!. or ill put cut fruit in a tupperware and bring that if i have access to a fridge. grapes are good to bring and dont need a fridge. i hated meal prepping too but it makes my life SO much easier and honestly i love being prepared now. wont catch me without snacks ever im like the mama bear i always have sustenance on me. i used to go rly hard and cook full ass meals all week long and put it in tupperwares but buying frozen meals honestly saves me a ton of time and money and sanity. no shame in eating an amys

Now I\u2019ve never really seen dance as a sport shall we say, however just because we \u2018prance\u2019 around in leotards and pink tights does NOT mean we don\u2019t work our little booties off training, perfecting routines, stretching .... you know the drill. We might not be as macho as rugby players or have biceps like rowers, but that does not mean dancers should not qualify for blues.\n\u2022\nSo as I\u2019ve alluded to above, many sports teams automatically get blues for their whole team. Every single member in many cases will get a blue. That includes rowing for example (standard \ud83d\ude11) but also the cheerleaders (who qualified last year) and what is called \u2018dance sport\u2019 in Cambridge (which I think is ballroom). HOWEVER our competition team STILL does not qualify for blues status. Ok we haven\u2019t competed in five varsity matches yet, which is another requirement apparently (\ud83d\ude44) but what is most frustrating for us is that, how can cheerleading and ballroom get blues and we can\u2019t? They are so similar!?!\n\u2022\nI\u2019m sorry for the rant, but I am still not done \ud83d\ude02 ..... Now you\u2019re probably wondering, how did I get a blue, along with two other of my dance gals? Essentially, we had to apply for \u2018extraordinary\u2019 blues. We all had to fill in an application and then present them to the blues committee. Pretty intimidating.

Thankfully I don\u2019t live in the jurisdiction of that police force but I\u2019m still not sure who decides where your local area ends. We want to drive a couple of miles and then walk. I think that\u2019ll be ok."},{"Description":"doc2","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc2","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: How is the baby doing so far with the transition? When she came to stay with you did you know she would be leaving? Will you get to visit her ever after she leaves? Do you like the adopters? My daughter is around the same age and I have felt so sad and nervous for you guys all week.  Answer: Aw thankyou, thoughtful anon. So many questions\u2026. let me answer them one by one.Baby is doing great with the transition so far. As we have progressed, she has had some periods of being unsettled when the adopters and me are all around, as she can sense something is changing and she is confused by who she wants and the different pulls on her emotions.When she came to stay with us, it was as a foster placement, so we always knew she would be moving on sooner or later. The government target is 26 weeks from court order for placement to final decision, so we had a rough idea she\u2019d be with us 6 months or so, but you just never know. Things can change, she could have moved much earlier to a foster-to-adopt placement.Yes we have some scheduled visits after she leaves. Recent research has shown that contrary to what standard practice used to be, foster carers visiting the child soon after placement helps the child settle in their new placement. It reassures them that their attachment figures haven\u2019t abandoned them, while they are still building their new attachment with their adopters. Also the adopters comforting them through the grief the baby naturally feels and expresses after seeing their precious foster carers helps build the baby\u2019s attachment bond with the adopters.The adopters are lovely. We really like them. They are quite young and so full of energy, warmth and enthusiasm. We have got on with them really well and hope that after baby moves to them, and after we have done all our scheduled visits, they will still keep in touch with us.Thankyou for thinking of us, it is really a difficult and draining time with a lot of mixed emotions xx"},{"Description":"doc3","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc3","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start\u2026.So first we had lockdown 1, where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was \u201cStay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives\u201dThen that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was \u201cHands, Face, Space\u201d ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had \u201cEat Out to Help Out\u201d, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system 1-3 with varying rules on what we could and couldn\u2019t do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown 2.0. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It\u2019s not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can\u2019t meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it\u2019s the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There\u2019s a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don\u2019t follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined \u00a310,000 for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan."},{"Description":"doc4","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc4","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"Question: Why did you skip two grades? Answer: The first year I skipped was year 2. I went to a really small primary school and there wasn\u2019t enough space in the classroom for us all. So the three oldest of us moved up to the other classroom and worked with the year above. At the end of that year, our parents decided whether we carried on with the year above or repeated the year. My parents decided I should carry on with the year above (the other two repeated the year).The second year I skipped was year 6 (final year of primary school). That was my parents decision, as I was already working a year ahead and I had finished all the maths work that the school had. My parents must have requested it but I don\u2019t know the details of how it was negotiated. I remember an educational psychologist coming out and doing an assessment with me. I was only 9 so it\u2019s all a bit hazy memories.I was just bright\u2026. I guess these days it would be called \u201cgifted and talented\u201d\u2026. and I had parents (well, my mum really, I think my dad just went along with it) who overvalued academic achievement. Also my Gran moved up a year at school and my mum moved up a year at school so there was a bit of an inheritance I suppose. However it stopped with me because there\u2019s no way I would move my children ahead of their age group."},{"Description":"doc5","Type":"Custom","Field":"doc5","VariableType":"String","DataVisibility":[],"AnalyzeText":false,"Value":"I\u2019ve had a manic morning. Baby fed at 1.30am and 4.30am last night, which made for a rather broken night, although she did settle and sleep well in between. She just takes a long time to feed. Thankfully then she slept through till 8.30am, which gave me time to wave all the girls off to school with a bit of individual attention each on the way. All three of them managed to walk several times past their piles of clean laundry on the landing though \ud83d\ude44 but I think that\u2019s standard for teenagers. Baby fed and then I gave her her first bath since she came to us. She wasn\u2019t impressed and cried the whole time till she was snuggly wrapped up in a towel again.    I had to phone d3\u2019s new school as the issues that caused her to move schools just won\u2019t die down. I think teenagers just don\u2019t think about what they\u2019re doing or what the consequences might be. I reported a threatening text d3 received to the police over the weekend so I\u2019m waiting to hear back from them. This has gone on long enough. d3 needs the chance to settle at her new school without all this horribleness. Unfortunately the older brother of the girl who\u2019s caused a lot of the problems at the old school was moved to d3\u2019s new school a couple of years ago, and he is now sticking his oar in with some horrible comments. Managed to shovel some scrambled eggs (and toast!) in while hustling around and organising, then took baby out to the contact centre to see her mum. While baby was in contact, I went for a run. It was hard hard hard. I ended up in a local cafe where I enjoyed a blissful 20 minutes sitting down with a coffee before going back to collect baby. We arrived home about 12.15pm and it was such a relief to plonk myself down on the sofa. I\u2019ve been waiting for the midwives to visit since then but there\u2019s still no sign of them. I\u2019m suspicious they\u2019ve forgotten. Nothing ever goes smoothly in foster care. I\u2019m tutoring in 45 minutes and I could do with them having been and gone by then!

Imagine you are asked to organize all these posts into different types and categories. For example, if users share similar concerns or issues, asking questions about a topic, sharing topics, or any combination of these. <br><br>To help you with that we used a computer program to generate themes for the collected data. A generated theme includes representative words and associated documents but depending on the situation you may look at words, documents, or both. For example, to refer to a theme you may use words or to investigate a theme you may look deeper into associated documents. <br><br>The program generated a large number of themes, but you are asked only wants to focus on the high quality themes. Thus, we want you to help us assess the quality of these themes. The quality of a theme can be determined using a variety of different criteria, which you will see later on.

One way of making sense of these issues, and the different positions that people take on an issue, is to think about the frames that structure debate about the issue. Frames help organize facts and information. They help define what counts as a problem, diagnose the problem\u2019s causes, and suggest remedies for solving the problem. These ways of thinking have lots of different parts, including stereotypes, metaphors, images, catchphrases, and other elements.<\/p>\n\n<p>These different frames are often associated with a particular way of talking about or communicating about an issue. Certain words or phrases might suggest that one or another frame is operating.<\/p>\n\n<p> Sociologists have developed a list of 15 frames that apply across a variety of different issues.
