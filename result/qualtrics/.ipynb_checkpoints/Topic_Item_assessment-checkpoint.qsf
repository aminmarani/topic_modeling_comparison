(2) Add something fairly thick to the smoothie. I added some soya milk that is pretty thick, but soya yoghurt for example would be even better. (3) Use non-frozen and frozen bananas.

All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for 37% off #affiliate) \ud83e\udd13 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB \ud83d\ude0f\n-\nLUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I\u2019ll share the recipe soon \ud83d\ude09) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2b\n-\nDINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol \ud83d\ude05).

Life is wayyyyyy way too short to not eat peanut butter from the tub ok \ud83d\ude05\n-\n001: Before my hill session (on my @strava) I had a banana, and as you guys know I always start my day with lots of water \ud83d\udca6\n-\n002: The recipe for my Purple Bae smoothie is in my Rainbow Smoothie Reel, and I had this alongside frozen fruit with flaxseed (I know this sounds strange but I actually love this combo \ud83d\ude09) and pb because it\u2019s literally the best \ud83d\ude0d\n-\n003: My sushi was definitely a fail, but it actually tasted really good!! I need to get a proper sushi making set, but I added leftover brown rice, cucumber, pepper and then topped it with tahini (not typical sushi, I know, and we didn\u2019t have avocado sadly)! The recipe was by @minimalistbaker if you\u2019re curious\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffbOh and the iced matcha latte was also a fail, but I\u2019m working on it \ud83d\ude48\n-\n004: Apples in the air fryer taste like apples from apple pie, which I love, and I had this with some @coconutcollab vegan custard, which is soooooo so thick and creamy \ud83d\ude0d 10/10 recommend! I also had some chocolate as well by @montezumaschocs \ud83c\udf6b\n-\n005: My favourite thing to do for dinner at the moment is to chop up potatoes and other veggies to put in the air fryer with some beans, so today it was sweet potato, mushrooms and kidney beans. I then had more veg on the side, spinach, pickles (because I\u2019ve been obsessed since birth lol), hemp seeds, nutritional yeast and hoisin sauce \ud83e\udd29\n-\n006: My go-to oat bowl with a pear never fails me, and today I added some blueberries mixed it with more pb \ud83e\udd5c\n-\nHappy Friday my friends and definitely LIKE this video if you want more of these reels \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a"}, {"Description": "doc3", "Type": "Custom", "Field": "doc3", "VariableType": "String", "DataVisibility": [], "AnalyzeText": false, "Value": "What I eat in a day as a vegan runner \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n-\nI\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m eating more than I ever have done before, and you know what, I\u2019ve never felt better!!!

All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for 37% off #affiliate) \ud83e\udd13 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB \ud83d\ude0f\n-\nLUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I\u2019ll share the recipe soon \ud83d\ude09) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2b\n-\nDINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol \ud83d\ude05).

Life is wayyyyyy way too short to not eat peanut butter from the tub ok \ud83d\ude05\n-\n001: Before my hill session (on my @strava) I had a banana, and as you guys know I always start my day with lots of water \ud83d\udca6\n-\n002: The recipe for my Purple Bae smoothie is in my Rainbow Smoothie Reel, and I had this alongside frozen fruit with flaxseed (I know this sounds strange but I actually love this combo \ud83d\ude09) and pb because it\u2019s literally the best \ud83d\ude0d\n-\n003: My sushi was definitely a fail, but it actually tasted really good!! I need to get a proper sushi making set, but I added leftover brown rice, cucumber, pepper and then topped it with tahini (not typical sushi, I know, and we didn\u2019t have avocado sadly)! The recipe was by @minimalistbaker if you\u2019re curious\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffbOh and the iced matcha latte was also a fail, but I\u2019m working on it \ud83d\ude48\n-\n004: Apples in the air fryer taste like apples from apple pie, which I love, and I had this with some @coconutcollab vegan custard, which is soooooo so thick and creamy \ud83d\ude0d 10/10 recommend! I also had some chocolate as well by @montezumaschocs \ud83c\udf6b\n-\n005: My favourite thing to do for dinner at the moment is to chop up potatoes and other veggies to put in the air fryer with some beans, so today it was sweet potato, mushrooms and kidney beans. I then had more veg on the side, spinach, pickles (because I\u2019ve been obsessed since birth lol), hemp seeds, nutritional yeast and hoisin sauce \ud83e\udd29\n-\n006: My go-to oat bowl with a pear never fails me, and today I added some blueberries mixed it with more pb \ud83e\udd5c\n-\nHappy Friday my friends and definitely LIKE this video if you want more of these reels \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a"}, {"Description": "doc3", "Type": "Custom", "Field": "doc3", "VariableType": "String", "DataVisibility": [], "AnalyzeText": false, "Value": "What I eat in a day as a vegan runner \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n-\nI\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m eating more than I ever have done before, and you know what, I\u2019ve never felt better!!!

All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for 37% off #affiliate) \ud83e\udd13 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB \ud83d\ude0f\n-\nLUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I\u2019ll share the recipe soon \ud83d\ude09) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2b\n-\nDINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol \ud83d\ude05).

Life is wayyyyyy way too short to not eat peanut butter from the tub ok \ud83d\ude05\n-\n001: Before my hill session (on my @strava) I had a banana, and as you guys know I always start my day with lots of water \ud83d\udca6\n-\n002: The recipe for my Purple Bae smoothie is in my Rainbow Smoothie Reel, and I had this alongside frozen fruit with flaxseed (I know this sounds strange but I actually love this combo \ud83d\ude09) and pb because it\u2019s literally the best \ud83d\ude0d\n-\n003: My sushi was definitely a fail, but it actually tasted really good!! I need to get a proper sushi making set, but I added leftover brown rice, cucumber, pepper and then topped it with tahini (not typical sushi, I know, and we didn\u2019t have avocado sadly)! The recipe was by @minimalistbaker if you\u2019re curious\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffbOh and the iced matcha latte was also a fail, but I\u2019m working on it \ud83d\ude48\n-\n004: Apples in the air fryer taste like apples from apple pie, which I love, and I had this with some @coconutcollab vegan custard, which is soooooo so thick and creamy \ud83d\ude0d 10/10 recommend! I also had some chocolate as well by @montezumaschocs \ud83c\udf6b\n-\n005: My favourite thing to do for dinner at the moment is to chop up potatoes and other veggies to put in the air fryer with some beans, so today it was sweet potato, mushrooms and kidney beans. I then had more veg on the side, spinach, pickles (because I\u2019ve been obsessed since birth lol), hemp seeds, nutritional yeast and hoisin sauce \ud83e\udd29\n-\n006: My go-to oat bowl with a pear never fails me, and today I added some blueberries mixed it with more pb \ud83e\udd5c\n-\nHappy Friday my friends and definitely LIKE this video if you want more of these reels \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a"}, {"Description": "doc3", "Type": "Custom", "Field": "doc3", "VariableType": "String", "DataVisibility": [], "AnalyzeText": false, "Value": "What I eat in a day as a vegan runner \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n-\nI\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m eating more than I ever have done before, and you know what, I\u2019ve never felt better!!!

All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for 37% off #affiliate) \ud83e\udd13 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB \ud83d\ude0f\n-\nLUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I\u2019ll share the recipe soon \ud83d\ude09) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2b\n-\nDINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol \ud83d\ude05).

Life is wayyyyyy way too short to not eat peanut butter from the tub ok \ud83d\ude05\n-\n001: Before my hill session (on my @strava) I had a banana, and as you guys know I always start my day with lots of water \ud83d\udca6\n-\n002: The recipe for my Purple Bae smoothie is in my Rainbow Smoothie Reel, and I had this alongside frozen fruit with flaxseed (I know this sounds strange but I actually love this combo \ud83d\ude09) and pb because it\u2019s literally the best \ud83d\ude0d\n-\n003: My sushi was definitely a fail, but it actually tasted really good!! I need to get a proper sushi making set, but I added leftover brown rice, cucumber, pepper and then topped it with tahini (not typical sushi, I know, and we didn\u2019t have avocado sadly)! The recipe was by @minimalistbaker if you\u2019re curious\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffbOh and the iced matcha latte was also a fail, but I\u2019m working on it \ud83d\ude48\n-\n004: Apples in the air fryer taste like apples from apple pie, which I love, and I had this with some @coconutcollab vegan custard, which is soooooo so thick and creamy \ud83d\ude0d 10/10 recommend! I also had some chocolate as well by @montezumaschocs \ud83c\udf6b\n-\n005: My favourite thing to do for dinner at the moment is to chop up potatoes and other veggies to put in the air fryer with some beans, so today it was sweet potato, mushrooms and kidney beans. I then had more veg on the side, spinach, pickles (because I\u2019ve been obsessed since birth lol), hemp seeds, nutritional yeast and hoisin sauce \ud83e\udd29\n-\n006: My go-to oat bowl with a pear never fails me, and today I added some blueberries mixed it with more pb \ud83e\udd5c\n-\nHappy Friday my friends and definitely LIKE this video if you want more of these reels \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a"}, {"Description": "doc3", "Type": "Custom", "Field": "doc3", "VariableType": "String", "DataVisibility": [], "AnalyzeText": false, "Value": "What I eat in a day as a vegan runner \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n-\nI\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019m eating more than I ever have done before, and you know what, I\u2019ve never felt better!!!

One way of making sense of these issues, and the different positions that people take on an issue, is to think about the frames that structure debate about the issue. Frames help organize facts and information. They help define what counts as a problem, diagnose the problem\u2019s causes, and suggest remedies for solving the problem. These ways of thinking have lots of different parts, including stereotypes, metaphors, images, catchphrases, and other elements.</p>\n\n<p>These different frames are often associated with a particular way of talking about or communicating about an issue. Certain words or phrases might suggest that one or another frame is operating.</p>\n\n<p> Sociologists have developed a list of 15 frames that apply across a variety of different issues. Each frame emphasizes different aspects of an issue.\n </p>\n   <ul>\n <li> <strong>Economic</strong>: costs, benefits, or other financial implications </li>\n <li><strong>Capacity and resources</strong>: availability of physical, human or financial resources, and capacity of current systems </li>\n <li><strong>Morality</strong>: religious or ethical implications </li>\n <li><strong>Fairness and equality</strong>: balance or distribution of rights, responsibilities, and resources </li>\n <li><strong>Legality, constitutionality and jurisprudence</strong>: rights, freedoms, and authority of individuals, corporations, and government </li>\n <li><strong>Policy prescription and evaluation</strong>: discussion of specific policies aimed at addressing problems </li>\n <li><strong>Crime and punishment</strong>: effectiveness and implications of laws and their enforcement </li>\n <li><strong>Security and defense</strong>: threats to welfare of the individual, community, or nation </li> \n <li><strong>Health and safety</strong>: health care, sanitation, public safety </li>  \n <li><strong>Quality of life</strong>: threats and opportunities for the individual\u2019s wealth, happiness, and well-being </li> \n <li><strong>Cultural identity</strong>: traditions, customs, or values of a social group in relation to a policy issue </li> \n <li><strong>Public opinion</strong>: attitudes and opinions of the general public, including polling and demographics </li> \n <li><strong>Political</strong>: considerations related to politics and politicians, including lobbying, elections, and attempts to sway voters </li> \n <li><strong>External regulation and reputation</strong>: international reputation or foreign policy of the U.S. </li><li><strong>Other</strong>: any coherent group of frames not covered by the above categories </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>", "DefaultChoices": false, "DataExportTag": "frame_def_collapsbl", "QuestionType": "DB", "Selector": "TB", "DataVisibility": {"Private": false, "Hidden": false}, "Configuration": {"QuestionDescriptionOption": "UseText"}, "QuestionDescription": "If you want to see the definition of Framing again, Click Here to view the definition Political i...", "ChoiceOrder": [], "Validation": {"Settings": {"Type": "None"}}, "GradingData": [], "Language": [], "NextChoiceId": 4, "NextAnswerId": 1, "QuestionID": "QID58"}}, {"SurveyID": "SV_9uwvR3h8rQJ1Zum", "Element": "SQ", "PrimaryAttribute": "QID81", "SecondaryAttribute": "If you want to see the theme again, Click Here to view the theme Associated Documents ...", "TertiaryAttribute": null, "Payload": {"QuestionText": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n<style>\n.collapsible {\n  background-color: #1780C1;\n  color: white;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  padding: 18px;\n  width: 100%;\n  border: none;\n  text-align: left;\n  outline: none;\n  font-size: 15px;\n}\n\n.active, .collapsible:hover {\n  background-color: #5F94B4;\n}\n\n.content {\n  padding: 0 18px;\n  display: none;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  background-color: #f1f1f1;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n\n\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\">If you want to see the theme again, Click Here to view the theme</button>\n<div class=\"content medium\" >\n  <p>Associated Documents</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>${e://Field/doc1}</li>\n  <br>\n    <li>${e://Field/doc2}</li>\n  <br>\n  <li>${e://Field/doc3}</li>\n  <br>\n  <li>${e://Field/doc4}</li>\n  <br>\n  <li>${e://Field/doc5}</li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nvar coll = document.getElementsByClassName(\"collapsible\");\nvar i;\n\nfor (i = 0;
