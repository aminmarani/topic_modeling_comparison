(code: AMB-BREE for % off online)

It's been so surreal to walk into a grocery store & find my own product on the shelves! So excited to see lil cartoon Bree & Mike take on Coles across the country & be easily available to those who haven't yet had the chance to discover how good these are 😍

It's still crazy to me to think that just - years ago I discovered Macro Mike & became a regular customer for a good year before I started sharing them on my story when I had about , followers. They reached out to me at that point to start working together & have believed in me ever since. So proud to be growing with this team, to have our own range (with more in the pipelines) & to be a Macro Mike Brand Hero 🦸‍♀️💛

The reason we created this range is because we wanted to offer anyone with a sweet tooth (AKA me) a healthier, more balanced dessert alternative. We created something that could be made easily (all you need is your choice of milk + a mug + a spoon) in travel sachets so you can take them with you to work, or to a friends' house, or on the road for a single serve chocolate-y mug cake (with melted choc chip pieces) within  seconds! Aaaaand I think we crushed it 🤭😍

My code: AMB-BREE will give you % off + enjoy free international shipping on orders over $!! Highly recommend stocking up & saving money on shipping since the shelf life lasts so long for all of their gluten free, vegan, all natural, high protein, macro balanced goodies!! (although I guarantee they won't last that long because they're sooooo good)

i poked and grabbed. i wasn't satisfied with the shape of x, or the softness of y. my mind instantly painted the situation as problem/solution.

i looked at these body parts as they were and i told myself that there was a problem. something wrong, a flaw, that was causing them to look this way. this is a narrative deeply ingrained in my being. i am aware of it. i am conscious of it. it is a whisper that i have virtually muted, and when it slips through the cracks, i am able to catch it.

but that doesn't mean it's not there.

the words we use to speak to ourselves can alter the course of our lives. by analyzing a body part and thinking, “the problem is…”, i'm telling myself that ) this body part isn't SUPPOSED to look this way, and ) it is my fault, that i am to blame for not having executed the solution.

in the past i've let this language win. and when it wins, it ends in misery. it ends in self-torture, bending over backwards to desperately alter the body that stands before me in the mirror. that “solution” i'm looking for? it doesn't exist. nothing will ever be % satisfactory.

the narrative i've shifted to instead falls along the lines of “this is how i was built”, “this is the body that was intended to carry me all along”. this narrative does not have hints of failure or blame on my behalf. it harbors acceptance for what is and what is meant to be. it is hard work. this is not always my default mindset. but it's the one i work diligently to call on 

just something to think about, you know? ♥️

Doc ID: 8074, distribution: 0.6308743080937453 ; our society tends to praise extroverts; they're our fearless, successful leaders. in the process of this praise we lose sight of the introvert. the introvert is defined not by what they are, but by what they are not: not loud, not boisterous, not daring. when the introvert assumes this definition there is little room to note their positive qualities. we tend to look down on the introvert and experience discomfort around them. .
there's a stigma surrounding the introvert, but like all stigmas, an honest conversation can change everything. .
i used to make excuses to avoid socializing. “i have a test on monday”, or the classic “im not feeling well”. the relief i felt through these lies was fleeting. i couldn't come to peace with my introversion because i thought id be judged for my ways. .
because we praise the extrovert, by extension we think less of its opposite, the introvert. if i exposed myself as this lesser being what would people think of me? . .
i spent years at pains with my identity as an introvert because i never openly accepted who i was. i tried to fight my nature by forcing myself into situations that didn't serve me. recently ive found power in vocalizing my needs. if i don't have it in me to go out, i decline the invitation with honesty. “i'm just not feeling up for something that demanding tonight”. (yes, socializing can be demanding!). the responses ive gotten are liberating. its incredible how honesty can foster compassion. my friends are willing to accommodate my needs, suggesting a small intimate night instead. theyre not judging me. instead, they're accepting me. this has helped me accept myself. .
hiding behind excuses crippled my ability to be honest with myself. speaking up for my needs has been wildly freeing. im not ashamed of my ways because i finally understand that any negative stigma that surrounds them stems from society being not correct, just misinformed. .
i encourage you to own who you are and vocalize what you need to be your best self. we only have one chance to live our best lives, one marked by freedom and acceptance. .

this is why negative self-talk is so powerful.

this is why positive self-talk is so powerful.

we have control over our own narrative.

positive self-talk helped me heal. for years i repeated short mantras to myself on a daily basis. words i believed were untrue but spoke to myself anyway. i remember crying alone in bathroom stalls in high school, telling myself i was strong, telling myself i was worthy of healing. i didn't believe these sentiments at the time. but i spoke them anyway.

i remember standing in the mirror as a teen- always standing in the mirror. analyzing myself from every angle. criticizing the way my body folded and creased, where it held weight and the shapes it didn't have. i told myself i loved my body for what it allowed me to do and not for how it looked. i didn't believe these sentiments at the time. but i spoke them anyway.

we grow to believe the words we repeat to ourselves. today i know i am strong and worthy of healing. today i know i love my body for what it allows me to do and not for how it looks. i laid a foundation of positive self-talk for years. it is what grounds me today. i whole-heartedly believe in things i never thought could be true. 

consistency. repetition. commitment. 

self-love. self-respect. self-care.

Doc ID: 7505, distribution: 0.6111425818223849 ; it would be so much easier to accept the body i have if i knew i couldn't change it.
.
.
if i could look at the parts i don't like, the ones that don't settle with me and say, “ah, but that's just how i am, that's how i'm meant to be, so i should move on”. wouldn't that be easier? not easy, but easIER.
.
.
but then i take a scroll through my social feeds and see wild transformations, before pictures highlighting body parts similar to mine right now, and after pictures explaining how, with hard work, they were able to alter these parts. change fate. “anything is possible”.
.
.
i commend these people for their drive and deeply respect their efforts. but it's unnerving to see, sometimes, for me anyway, as someone who is simply trying to be okay with where i am and accepting of what i have.
.
.
accepting my body at its current state is HARD because after seeing proof that change is possible, i feel an immense pressure to…well, change. change my body. change my diet. change my exercise routine. i feel like a fraud for telling myself that this is the body i'm meant to have when i see so many people proving that this isn't the case. i feel bad for not doing more. .
.
of course i know these are irrational thoughts. life after recovery is just that; being able to address irrational thoughts as irrational. acknowledging them but not nurturing them. letting them be and letting them go.
.
.
i bring this up because it's been on my mind. some days are harder than others, you know, dealing with pressure. i share this so somebody can feel seen and relate. together we can read these words back and understand that life after recovery isn't perfect. irrational thoughts will come. pressure will feel heavy. .
.
i'm just feeling out loud. here's what's on my mind. sharing, thinking, and being. sometimes i don't have answers or advice. sometimes i just have fleeting thoughts and emotions. this is a space for me to share it all.

self-love is recognizing and affirming yourself for who you really are.

self-love is accepting yourself however you show up on any given day.

self-love is honoring yourself and your body even when you don't feel good.

self-love is being honest with yourself about where you're at and what is really best for you.

self-love is knowing you are enough regardless of what any other voice (including the one inside your head) says.

self-love is letting go of the idea of being perfect.

self-love is knowing that your worth doesn't change even when you do.

self-love is freedom, and being free is the best feeling in the world.

i was just thinking about where i am in terms of the mental freedom i have, the career path i am on, and the people closest to me in my life, and i can definitely say i am not even close to where i thought was even possible for me to be even just a year ago
——
while i don't believe in manifestation in the sense that if you imagine something to be true, it magically will be, i do believe that positive mindset, thoughts, and emotions can be so incredibly powerful.  you can't always control everything that's going to happen in life, but you can control your responses, your reactions, and your thoughts, and when you realize that, you realize you control your life, and your choices determine your fate

this applies to life as a whole. if you spend your life constantly thinking about what other people think of you, is your life really your own??

this isn't to say “being yourself” and caring less about what others think is easy like it's sometimes made it out to be. i've been working on self-discovery and self-acceptance for years and still often feel very  lost, scared, and insecure. but, each layer of myself that has be broken down has lead to a little bit more of myself being broken free, and each phase of growth that i've been through over the years has been so worth the hardship i went through to get there.

often times, becoming your most authentic self is about losing who you were expected to be over and over and over again. so in the process of becoming your most authentic self,
don't be afraid to change.
don't be afraid to disappoint others.
don't be afraid to set boundaries.
don't be afraid to be uncomfortable.
don't be afraid to lose people.
don't be afraid to let go of what you've always known.

however this can apply to you today: feel the fear, and do it anyway.

You need to start seeing it as a choice, because it's the only way you'll be able to choose differently imo. It is a choice. % everything you put in your body is your choice.  Answer: It is a choice, but just because it's a choice doesn't mean it easy to make it. It would be a choice to jump out of a plane to do a skydive, but that doesn't mean I could do it. It would be a choice for you to come off anon and reveal yourself, but you're not choosing to do that.Some choices are easier to make than others, depending on all sorts of things — external and internal factors. Circumstances can make it hard to make choices that in different circumstances we would find more easy to make. Currently I'm in a time with a lot of difficult circumstances. I'm trying to keep my explanation simple here so that even you with your apparent  staggering lack of compassion might be able to grasp it.

i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

Doc ID: 16395, distribution: 0.9575404206063131 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 15427, distribution: 0.9458565643324452 ; Teletherapy  At the end of therapy yesterday, we were talking about doing therapy online and how it has worked really well for us. T said when she first moved away and we changed from face to face therapy to doing it over Skype, she had a supervisor in her new location who told her that she really needed to work towards terminating with me and getting me to start back seeing someone face to face. Of course T didn't tell me that at the time, but she said she herself felt very resistant to that idea and she felt that we were doing really good work together over Skype. So in our conversation in session yesterday, T was reflecting on how now most therapy has gone online, many therapists and clients are discovering there are actually benefits to it. T said some clients are reporting that they find even sessions over the phone helpful because there is yet another extra layer of distance so they can be more open.  I think that maybe it has been implied to her in supervision and peer supervision that therapy by Skype can not possibly be as good as face to face, and now that all these therapists are having to do therapy by Skype too, they're realising it doesn't have to be a second-best method. For some clients (maybe mostly the avoidant ones like me, ha!), that extra bit of distance helps them say things that would feel too overwhelming or difficult to say actually in person. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15372, distribution: 0.9424064668782979 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

Doc ID: 16131, distribution: 0.9307384263581517 ; Therapy .. // H deserves someone nicer than me  I wrote in my last therapy post about how we spent most of this session talking about the physical stuff between H and I, and how I would like myself to be different. It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. “Uh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.” (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said “”. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, “Oh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown….. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.” T sucked a breath in and said “Ohhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.” I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit.

Doc ID: 16905, distribution: 0.9266154618620396 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9214331003724759 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 16855, distribution: 0.9186365899754858 ; Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says “Where to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about…. what we were talking about last week?” “I feel like I'm in a gap between those two things” “Ok, well…. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?” I nod. T flips a page in front of her. “You said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?” That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says “So you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?” “Uh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.” “Did you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?” “Noooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.” “Hmm and did you feel that I felt like that?” “Well nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.” We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? “No, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think… I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit… *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.” I hadn't “stopped eating”, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.9096260526644919 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16185, distribution: 0.909114644713937 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

@cheufishtown_nunu asian fusion ramen bar with a menu of asian inspired noodle bowls, soups, and small plates, sushi, and japanese-style pub food. great food and atmosphere. the scallion rangoons appetizer here is a must order!

@charlie_was vegan restaurant serving creative plant-based small plates and excellent cocktails. my favorites were their espresso martini, ricotta, and silken tofu & mushroom ramen.

@grancaffelaquila i haven't gotten the chance to have a full dining experience here yet (although i've heard great things!), but i go just for their gelato, and it is phenomenal. my go-to flavor combo is pistachio + fondente, but i like to mix it up too, and you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors here.

Or we sometimes make cheese toasties, which is like a basic cheese sandwich that you can then put in a special bag that goes in the toaster to toast the bread and melt the cheese - or you can put it in a toastie maker machine.

 Since we're about a month out from NEDA's annual eating disorder awareness week, I anticipate lots of language will start cropping up around “fighting” your eating disorder or in some way demonizing it. But in my experience, compassion toward your eating disorder takes you further in recovery. 
 It seems that it's still a relatively foreign concept in the ED recovery community to talk about the self-destructive parts of your brain as protective and creative (which is simply seeing their function, not romanticizing) instead of monstrous. But that shift in framing makes a difference. 
 The eating disorder part is an attempt to survive or cope with (most often) trauma. Seeing it as a part of self that is trying to tell you something & trying to help you through in a creative, if ultimately maladaptive way gives you room to stop beating yourself up.

Doc ID: 12295, distribution: 0.781402099797697 ; Don't let any mental health practitioner or treatment center try to tell you mindfulness is the answer to all of your problems, especially if you are a trauma survivor. If mindfulness is not done in a trauma-informed way, it can be re-traumatizing!  “For people who've experienced trauma, mindfulness meditation can actually end up exacerbating symptoms of traumatic stress. When asked to pay focused, sustained attention to their internal experience, trauma survivors can find themselves overwhelmed by flashbacks and heightened emotional arousal. I've met survivors who, despite their best intentions, have ended up feeling disoriented, distressed and humiliated for somehow making things worse. The power of meditation thrusts survivors directly into the heart of wounds that often require more than mindful awareness to heal.
 Yet mindfulness is also a valuable asset for trauma survivors. Mindfulness can enhance present-moment awareness, increase self-compassion, and strengthen a person's ability to self-regulate—all important skills that support trauma recovery. The question for those of us who teach and utilize mindfulness is thus how we can help minimize the potential dangers of meditation to trauma survivors while simultaneously leveraging its potential benefits.”

therapist: “No, you're not avoiding it. You're brain is just trying to protect you again. There's a difference, Lindsay.” Y'all, it's seriously amazing the good that compassionate re-framing can do for the soul.  I've had a lot of past mental health professionals who told me I was avoidant and non-compliant in treatment programs for struggling, so that's the language I learned to use for myself. Now I'm being met with kindness and understanding when I expect frustration and anger and it's weird and good and healing. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12175, distribution: 0.7719487007934717 ; my therapist is a big fan of the phrase “try softer,” and the idea that trying willpower / push ourselves into healing from trauma isn't particularly helpful. even shifting language has made a difference for me. I remember a session where I told her I couldn't figure out why I was avoiding a particular emotion. “can we find softer language for that?” she asked me - and the re-framing helped me view that past behavior as serving a protective function.  thus, tonight's portrait is of Aundi Kolber. a human who is helping bring more a compassionate lens to trauma healing.

Topic 9 :

Doc ID: 2392, distribution: 0.9730111961876796 ; You will never ✨actually✨ see your own body. You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Doc ID: 2419, distribution: 0.9725897284923684 ; Just your weekly reminder that it's okay to exist with cellulite, fat on your body, loose skin, rolls, pimples, softness, and in all of those “less flattering” angles.

So often people joke about “girls on Instagram VS girls in real life” or catfishing in general… These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look “flattering” & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat 🙄

The thing is, you don't have to be “picture perfect” all the time… ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life… Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone “perfect” & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own… Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Happy Real Me Monday!! Side note: the green activewear set is unreleased @gymshark — it's coming sooon!! GS link is in my bio 😍

The truth is, I used to compare myself to the posed, edited & perfected photos of other women on the internet. Then I'd pose, edit & perfect my own photos in order to feel half as beautiful as they appeared to be, and without me realising, that would've caused another woman to jump online & compare her body to the posed, edited & perfected photos of mine.

Leave a '🥲👑' in the comments if this is something you can relate to, because I know I'm not the only one 👀

This is exactly why I started posting this series  weeks ago... I don't want you to see my photos & wish you were beautiful like me, I want you to see that being beautiful LIKE YOU is good enough. I want you to feel better after seeing my posts, not worse. I hope you'll feel encouraged to wear the shorts, instead of covering up & hiding yourself away. I hope you'll remember that what you see on social media is a highlight reel & that you have no reason to be ashamed of the body you're in.

I'm not joking when I say that getting the photos on the left took me AGES. They took the right lighting, twisting my body in the right position to elongate the right places, sucking in, tensing hard & holding my breath. The photos on the right took a split second because that's just ME.

So please, don't compare yourself.
If you continuously compete with others, you become bitter. But if you continuously aim to improve yourself and your own self-thoughts, you become better. It's you VS you 💛

You're wonderful. 
And this week is going to be great!
That is all — can't wait to chat with you in the comments 🌈

If you could create your own beauty standards... What would that look like? Hopefully it would look like the person you see when you look in the mirror and be everchanging as you grow older.

Cellulite, stretch marks, acne scars, arm flab, small curves, bloated bellies, hairy bodies, (the list goes on) aren't imperfections... You aren't flawed because of these things, you're HUMAN & a worthy one at that! 

I see photos of supermodels on my Instagram explore page ALL. THE. TIME... Do I think they're beautiful? Yes, they're stunning! But do I think I'm less beautiful because of them? Not at all. We're all built differently and made up of so many unique features, qualities & values that make us US. Embrace that! ✨

I'm sure we all have that friend who can't see how beautiful they are, they make negative comments about their appearance around you and you just can't understand how they don't see how gorgeous they are, right? Well, girlfriend, THAT'S YOU! YOU'RE THE FRIEND & YOU'RE AMAZING. (And so many other people see it in you too!) Okay? Coool, glad we got that sorted 🥰

Body image is not about how you look, it's about what you think and how you feel.

(I believe the first part is quoted from @thebodylovesociety but I changed a few things for this post)

I don't want my whole life to be shaped around what shape my body is.

I didn't want to spend another day comparing myself to others and only accepting myself if I looked a certain way.

I don't want to look back on my life and regret turning down fun invitations or photos with loved ones or wishing I could do things differently.

How about you? … Let this be the motivation / inspiration for you to be gentler with yourself this week! 🥰

Sprinkle the comments with “🤝” emojis if you're going to make a deal with your current AND future self, to be kinder to yourself & try to live your life more aligned with the things that make you happy & less aligned with the unrealistic expectations you have grown up believing you had to live by.

When we stop focusing on the way we look, we create space to make our lives bigger. Happy Real Me Monday 💗

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human — there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

Just a mid-week reminder to please be careful with what you consume online (and in real life).

It only took  minute to download this app & less than  minute to edit… 🥴 Anyone with a phone has access to tweaking their photos within just a few clicks. Would you have been able to tell? 🤐

It's unfair to compare yourself and your life with someone else's highlight reel. Your REAL is enough!!!

Disclaimer: I was posing in the original photo to emulate the kind of underwear ads I grew up with (unlike Lounge who embraces all bodies), so my body still looks very different when I breathe out & relax. I'll share the relaxed photo(s) on my story! Nothing wrong with posing for a photo, but IMO it's always important to remain transparent & real with those who consume my content.

At , I discovered photo editing apps that made it easy for me to tweak a few things so that I could fit the mold of “beauty”. I'd make my waist smaller, or my arms thinner, or blur out any blemishes, the list goes on 😅

I didn't post a single unedited photo of myself from ages  -  on social media. I felt such an immense pressure to look a specific way & for everything to look picture perfect. It's sad to think that I never liked a single photo of myself for  years & thought I had to change my appearance in order to be seen or liked. 

I don't have many photos from those years where I can see what I *actually* looked like, because all I have is an edited version of myself.

So this post isn't to expose people who edit their photos… It's to say: I've been there too. But just so you know, you don't need to change the way you look for other people's approval or pleasure. AND it IS possible to improve your perspective towards yourself, delete the apps & show up as you are 💐

One day, when you're  years old, you're going to wish you had photos of your youthful skin & candid smile to show your children, or grandchildren, or just to treasure those moments yourself. 

You're allowed to show up with acne, armpit fat, rolls & mess in the background of your photos. 

So please, if you're scrolling the internet & find yourself in a cycle of comparison, just remember this. And if you're contemplating editing yourself with just a few clicks of an app, come back to this & consider whether you want people to “like” you based on this internet version of yourself, or if you want to be “liked” for who you really are.

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

Doc ID: 2601, distribution: 0.812022796034031 ; Goal on the left ⬅️ was to wear the smallest size. You know, when I was told I had to gain weight to recover my period & get back to a healthier weight, my goal became weight gain, BUT only in the form of MUSCLE…

Goal on the right ➡️ I did it! I got back to a healthier weight, recovered my period, and guess what? I gained FAT too, and that's okay!!! My goal now is to just wear whatever size fits my body, prioritise my health & enjoy my life 💪🏼

You're not supposed to fit a clothing size, the clothes are supposed to fit YOU 👗👙👖

So many of us are programmed to believe that having fat on your body is bad... So often when we create a health goal, it's to lose fat or gain muscle. And that's okay, working on yourself is great, but I just wanted to leave this here to remind you that:

Fat isn't bad. It plays an important role & is essential for hormone regulation, fertility, vitamin absorption & temperature regulation. Fat is stored energy, so when your body needs energy without access to food, it can use that for energy. It also cushions your organs & bones - imagine sitting on your bum bones with no cushioning, I can tell you: it hurts! 😅🍑

Disclaimer: I'm not saying there aren't health risks related with too much excess fat on the body. Because there absolutely are health risks related to excess fat / eating a diet full of low nutritional foods / a sedentary lifestyle. 

All I'm saying is: your body shouldn't be WITHOUT fat. That lower belly bump? The cellulite? The rolls? That's fat under the skin... And if you're healthy & happy, then please know that it's not something you “need to get rid of”!!! If you want to work on you, go boo you've got this, BUT know that having a layer of fat on your body IS healthy & completely normal, okay? 🥰 

I just don't ever want anyone to get to the point I did, where these fears & thoughts control your life, hurt your health & make you feel bad about your body. That's all I intend with this post 💛

Stay healthy & happy besties. All my love xo

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

Doc ID: 9562, distribution: 0.7763467422294705 ; i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they're meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

These are all questions I had in the photo on the left after I'd lost kgs. And I'm not gonna lie, with increasing my food intake, I did regain a few kilos back, some in the form of muscle & some in the form of fat, but that's not something to be feared or afraid of. I now eat more than ever before & maintain my weight! I couldn't have done that without working my metabolism back to this point. It made me realise that my 'goal weight' wasn't a certain body shape, it was whatever weight I reached by actually LIVING & prioritising my health!

So yeah, I gained a few kilos, but swipe across to see what else I gained! <

✨ NOURISH YOUR BODY ✨
FOOD is your body's fuel. It needs it to survive. Food itself won't cause you to lose or gain weight, it's your overall intake VS output that will.

✨ PRACTISE FLEXIBILITY ✨
This is important on ANY health journey. Whether you want to lose weight, maintain your weight, gain weight… Practise flexibility. My body burns roughly  cals a day, but some days I'll eat  cals, other days I'll eat . Just listen to your body's cues and fuel it with delicious & nutritious food. That's balance bby, it all balances out in the end! 

✨ LIVE YOUR LIFE ✨
Weight fluctuations don't mean you're losing control or going backwards… They're an indication that you're LIVING YOUR LIFE. Last year was my first year of maintaining my weight… And what that *ACTUALLY* looked like was my body weight going up & down by about kgs all-year round… My weight may have fluctuated slightly, but my overall confidence, happiness, health & sanity DID NOT!

Whether your goal is to lose weight, maintain your weight, gain fat, gain muscle, create a healthier relationship with food, increase your strength, run km, workout more, etc... It's pretty fair to say that most of us seek 'progress' within the first couple of weeks of changing our lifestyles. BUT, change takes time. Swipe across to watch me explain the paper towel analogy... It explains the process of progress perfectly! Especially if you're a visual learner! 👏🏻

The top left photo was from the start of my weight loss journey — there's an entire year between the first and last photo.... and  months between me reaching my lowest weight (Aug ) & working towards reaching a healthier weight again & gaining some weight back. If I gave up on my journey because I wasn't seeing results a few weeks in, I never would've made it to the point I'm at now. Seeing results & a significant change doesn't happen overnight, but it ✨ WILL ✨ happen. So no matter what your goals are, KEEP GOING! 

Here's a few things that WON'T ruin your progress:
-  day of overeating
-  'bad' meal (no food is BAD, there's only LESS nutritious or MORE nutritious foods, both are fine to eat!)
- Missing a workout
- Having a rest day
- Exceeding your macro goals for the day
- Not hitting your step goal
- Cutting your workout short

+ WAAAY more!

Ask yourself, “what makes living a healthier lifestyle so hard?” and then once you've written them down, come up with some solutions to make it a lil easier & enjoyable for yourself!!! And remember, be PATIENT and CONSISTENT. You've got this! The only way you'll fail is if you give up 💪🏼

I weigh the exact same amount in both photos but my body looks different. That's because the ratio between fat & muscle has changed 💪🏼

On the left: I did only HIIT & cardio-based training! On the right: I do weightlifting & resistance training!

I still do a mix of both to this day, I'm not saying one is good and the other is bad! The great thing about exercise is that there's not just one type of movement you should do. Move your body in ANY way you enjoy! 😻 But as a female, I used to be scared to lift weights because I thought I'd get bulky & 'manly'... It really doesn't work that way!

🏋🏻‍♀️ Don't be afraid of lifting weights & strength training! Toning up is the act of gaining muscle. This is what gives your body definition. You will not get bulky overnight, gaining muscle takes time!! But this also depends on your genetic makeup. For some, gaining muscle comes more naturally. 

🏃🏻‍♀️ Walking is my FAV form of cardio. It's a passive & low-impact way to get your body moving, plus it's amazing for maintaining your overall health. That's why I always start my day with a light walk!

🍽 To gain muscle, you have to be eating ENOUGH & this usually means you have to eat in a SLIGHT calorie surplus. This gives your body that little bit of extra energy it needs to build muscle.

⏰ Give it time. I didn't notice my body changing very much as each day passed, but now that I look back I can definitely see the difference! Remember the paper towel analogy I posted last week!! 😉

🥪 Eat enough protein & carbs, they aren't bad! I prioritised my protein intake to ensure I was getting enough. I also didn't avoid carbs at all throughout my entire health & fitness journey. They're the body's preferred energy source! Enjoy them! 

😴 Rest & recover! This is where the magic happens. Your body is constantly working hard for you, so giving it that time to actually recover is vital! 🛌 

What kind of exercise do you prefer? 🙈

 thinhip: 

 psa  stop telling people with eds that weight lifting will make them bulky. it literally, scientifically cannot make you bigger if youre in a caloric deficit. in fact, just doing cardio while losing weight has some really undesirable side effects, including: loose, saggy skinmuscle atrophysignificant decrease in strengthdecrease in metabolism speed due to muscle losslower energy levelsdecrease in endurance strength why won't it make me bigger, you ask? where's the proof? well, it's in the science. muscle cannot grow while in a caloric deficit, especially in one as extreme as we put ourselves in. while it can be strengthened and toned, it physically cannot grow without a surplus of calories. surplus meaning an extra - calories OVER your TDEE. if you ate this much and did weight training, you would see growth and a higher number on the scale. however, in a caloric deficit, you will only see a decrease in weight/body fat percentage and a higher lean muscle mass percentage, while looking smaller yet more tight and toned. muscle also burns around % more calories per hour than fat does. that being, having more lean muscle mass than body fat will increase your BMR and your metabolism even while idle. some benefits to weight training are: increase in strengthincrease in enduranceheightened metabolismlower body fat percentagehigher energy levelstight, “fitting” skinboost in moods/emotional stability TL;DR, cardio alone may burn lots of calories in the moment, but in the end will not give you the results you desire. pair daily cardio with frequent muscle training and you will achieve the tight, toned, and yet thin and small frame look youre going for, along with better moods, a higher metabolism, and various other benefits. 

 THIS is like my biggest pet peeve ever. People have no idea how much work and food it takes to actually gain muscle mass, especially for women. Like, you don't accidentally just become 'bulky' and look like a professional body builder, so just stop worrying already.

Doc ID: 2678, distribution: 0.7620570624837083 ; REALITY CHECK! 😅 Weight loss won't fix your body image issues & weight gain doesn't make you a failure, it doesn't make you unhealthy & it certainly doesn't make you less worthy... Let me tell you why! 🤩

I've spoken a lot about my kg weight loss journey, but here's a dedicated post about my experience with weight GAIN.

The photo on the left was me at the end of my weight loss journey, I weighed kgs & had lost my menstrual cycle due to being underweight. Becoming this lean wasn't my intention or goal at first, and I lost weight in a healthy way, it's just that I kept losing weight longer than I needed to because I still wasn't entirely happy with myself when I thought I would be. That's when I realised health has to come first and my mindset/self-thoughts were the things I had to change. So if you think you're going to be happy once you lose weight or 'get skinny', think again. Becoming happy in your skin starts NOW, no matter where you are in your health journey, no matter what your body looks like... It's not something that just happens... Confidence and self-love happens with time, practise, rewiring your mindset, living a happy/healthy lifestyle & plenty of kind thoughts. 

Our weight is ALWAYS going to fluctuate throughout our lives, but that doesn't mean our love for ourselves has to. Your body deserves proper nourishment, it needs time to rest & recover, it needs FAT to surround and insulate vital organs. Believe it or not, the fat on our body is like a fuel tank, it's an energy reserve to protect us against starvation... How bloody amazing is it that our bodies operate this way?! 

So, the next time you think negatively about weight gain or 'fat', remember that your body wouldn't function properly without it & it's perfectly healthy to have cushion on your bones!! ☁️ 🥰 ✨

Disclaimer: this isn't to discredit the positive impact my weight loss journey had on me — it's ultimately why I'm where I'm at today with health & confidence! But health is # 🍌🍔🥬🍕

Doc ID: 2619, distribution: 0.7314115190742405 ; Are you afraid of eating higher calorie foods, untracked meals & weight gain? I used to be too... But let me explain why you shouldn't be 🙈

Firstly, I want you to ask yourself  questions... 
“What if I wake up in  years time a few kilos heavier than I am now?
Now ask yourself, “What if I wake up in  years time still terrified of food?” 
Which is worse? 🤔

Secondly, high calorie / untracked meals DON'T equal weight gain. Eating at a caloric surplus consistently = weight gain. So let's just get that outta the way! 💪🏼

Significant weight changes don't happen overnight. It takes eating an excess of , calories on top of the amount of calories your body burns to gain a mere .kg of body weight which is usually distributed across your entire body... So no you won't wake up kgs heavier after overeating for a day or two. In fact, you really won't notice a physical difference at all!

When you do overeat, you may notice some initial temporary changes such as bloating & puffiness, but this is the body's natural response to receiving extra energy & it will go away after a few days! So don't go into a frenzy where you start punishing your body, eating less & working out more... Just ride the wave & give your body some time! ✨

When you eat intuitively, it's normal for your physique & weight to fluctuate because you'll unintentionally overeat or under-eat sometimes, but so long as you're making healthy, balanced choices overall, it'll likely balance out in the end. If it doesn't & you end up seeing changes you're not % comfortable with, that's okay too!

Weight gain doesn't make you a failure, there's nothing wrong with fuelling & nourishing your body well! It doesn't happen overnight, just like weight loss doesn't happen overnight. So yes, you can tweak your eating habits slightly along the way to suit your goals, but there's so much more to life than counting calories & fearing weight gain. Trust your body & enjoy your life 💛

This information is what has helped me have a more flexible & realistic approach to health & nutrition, so I hope it helps you too 🥰

 beckelstein: 

 I find it odd how the fandom focuses so much on Aang's childhood being ruined when he learned he was the Avatar at , but there's very little talk about how discovering she was the Avatar as a toddler affected Korra's life and how she was raised. But we'll circle back to that… Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters – That is the Child Prodigy.  We'll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).  All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let's be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.  And that become a problem for one asshole in particular…  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai's maniacal ego couldn't handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn't the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this…  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering  of the  Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).  Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.  Aang/Sokka/Katara's story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.  Now, let's talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.   Yes, of course I'm talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph's family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka's arm in environment where her bending couldn't help her “see”.  Toph's story is a foil to Azula's, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph's story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.         Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we'll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara's potential and Sokka's genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many  yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka's character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season. Not to mention that because he wasn't a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can't be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations' actions.  Toph's anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn't as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.  While Toph's talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka's wasn't acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you're thinking. Zuko wasn't a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn't catch up with Azula's until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).  Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It's possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).  As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another's talent it's quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.  This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko's early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy's cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  “Azula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born”  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we've covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It's well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We'll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.  When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras' and other Avatars' lives.  . She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other  elements, buy also many things about the  other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naiveté about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. .  She was trained and mastered  of the elements by the time she was . Most Avatars don't know they have this power until they reach  and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra's natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang's, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep. she lacked restraint. I'm not saying her bending isn't great, but rather because it is so great it's her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naiveté of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.   Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through  seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend  elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?  It's a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.   Unlike Toph's parents, Iroh worried over Zuko's well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn't want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn't a prodigy like his sister.  And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.

 [tw: eating disorder] 
 I cried for the entirety of our fifty minute therapy session, crumpled tissues piling high next to me, after she asked me what it was exactly about the eating disorder that I did not want to go back to.  
 As I described to her in between sobs what is is to survive ten years of violence inflicted upon your own body, something inside of me seemed to break. Remembering the nights of raw throated agony as I kneeled before a toilet bowl to pay my penance for my sins / the days of primal hunger as my stomach burned and my muscles ached, there was a sense of sheer terror that I would ever return to that life of suffering. 
 And yet it pulls at me, the Monster, always calling me backwards towards sickness, towards dying, towards pain. It roars in my head that there is something unclean running through my veins that must be dug out; that I have, merely by existing, perpetrated the greatest of all crimes, transgressed the laws of the gods, and I must spend the rest of my days on my knees repenting. 
 I have spent a lifetime, all of my short twenty-six years on this earth, atoning for sins that I have never even committed.  
 Are the gods satisfied yet?  
                                                            ….. 
 “Maybe,” she says slowly, weighing her words, “maybe, you have suffered enough.” 
 I grab another tissue and hug my knees to my chest. 
 It is deeply violent to deprive your body of the necessary calories it needs to survive, to heave and convulse before a toilet bowl altar, to run until your body is on the verge of collapse. What is it to live through trauma that is of your own making? What is it to live through such extreme violence at your own hands?  
 For so long I have numbed myself to the reality of what I was doing, but I felt the gravity of it all in that moment, telling her about how I used to lay in bed, counting my too-slow heartbeats to make sure I was still alive, all the while praying that I was not. Because, I tell her, to wake up and live another day meant listening to the Monster's orders, being a slave to Its sadistic whims and I couldn't bear that one more day.  
 I choke down more tears.  
 Reliving those days, those haunted days, brings up gut-wrenching pain. 
 Yet I have begun to listen to the Monster again lately, buying into Its silver-tongued promises and rose-colored visions of safety and control. I know better, know that the life it offers is a life against my values.  
 But 
 It's just one snack.  
 One run. 
 One meal. 
 One day. 
 One week. 
 One life. 
 And I can feel myself falling again, spiraling into the dark place where I cannot choose for myself but can only obey / obey / obey the Monster.  
 This is not the life that I want. I don't want to go back to living as the dead, to walking around half-girl, half-ghost. I am terrified of being forced into living against myself again, committing violence against my body, directed by my mind.  
 She tells me that I have a choice in this, that I am giving away my power too easily, and I don't know that I believe her. I want to, but it doesn't feel true.  
                                                       ….. 
 Just eat your food, Lindsay, I tell myself, eat your damn food.  
 I am sitting at a restaurant with friends, smiling and laughing and talking as though I were not starving myself to death.  
 The full plate of food in front of me makes my stomach growl and the hunger pangs grow stronger.  
 I can hear the therapist's voice in my head, Think about the life that you want. This is not what you want.  
 But the voice of the Monster is loud and strong, and I feel small and weak in comparison.  
                                                         ….. 
 “I don't know how to want to eat,” I tell her.  
 “You won't want to,” she says, “You just have to go through the motions for a while before it gets easier.”  
 I open the door to the refrigerator, close it, and then open it again.  
 I do not want to eat. 
 But I am so very tired of pain, always pain. 
 I am so very tired of dying.  
 I am so very tired of the hellish existence that is my eating disorder. 
 I get out a plate. 
 I make no promises for tomorrow, I tell her. I'm not committing myself to recovery and rainbows and sunshine. I don't know that I am even capable of beating back the Monster for any extended length of time. The Monster's grip on me is tight. 
 But maybe - I hesitate before continuing - maybe just for this one meal, I have suffered enough.

Doc ID: 19677, distribution: 0.9359452243586641 ; Question: I've never been inpatient before... what's it like where you are?  Answer: I've only been in two different places so I don't really have much to compare but I'll try my best. I was admitted involuntarily to an inpatient hospital near where I go to school (in a different state). That hospital didn't have any groups or activities during the day and we weren't allowed in our rooms unless we were sleeping. They also didn't have psychiatrists or therapists. Basically there was one large room where all the patients sat together and watched tv all day. That hospital was pretty bad. The one I'm in now is supposedly the best psychiatric hospital in the US. I've been to this inpatient unit three times now and it's very nice compared to the other one. Our day is very structured and we have different activities we can go to (but we're not forced to). We have several groups each day like CBT, DBT, ACT, art therapy, walks, music, and more. We are also assigned a psychiatrist and a social worker to coordinate everything while we're there and also aftercare planning. Let me know if you have any other questions! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19459, distribution: 0.9359006843667674 ; Day  was kind of garbage. I woke up and was in a bad mood. Then my roommate got moved to a different room and we got along well so that sucked. I had a phone call with the department of mental health and that made me feel worse. I slept for most of the morning just to avoid everything. I spent the afternoon with friends and some friends from school visited me. I also had to deal with some invalidating stuff about my gender and that made me more upset. It was just a bad day. I'm glad I got to see my friends though. I'm also glad that I have friends on the unit who support me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19724, distribution: 0.935360140948519 ; Day  of inpatient was one of the best days I've had so far. I slept better than usual but still not great. I was taken down for tms at am but when I got there they told me that I actually had it at am. My aunt brought me Starbucks and I listened to music. Then I went to tms for real. I went to group and then on a walk and then hung out with my roommate. I had a visitor who brought me dinner and we played cards. Then I went to art group and talked to a staff member about musicals. Now I'm just chilling in my room. My mood was pretty okay and my anxiety was not great but not awful. Everything was manageable today and that's progress. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19537, distribution: 0.9348127927389492 ; Day  of inpatient was actually really good. Weekends here are usually super boring and my closest friends were both out on pass for most of the day and I was worried about being alone but it was a surprisingly good day. I ended up meeting some of the new patients and making more friends and that was nice. My parents visited and I got to see my dogs and then my friends came back and we played games and just talked. My depression and anxiety were both very manageable today and I had a really good conversation with a staff member. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19909, distribution: 0.9313918720113694 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty bad. I woke up a lot later than usual because my anxiety medication made me really tired. I wasn't able to go on any of the walks today because the staff didn't think I was safe to go. They made me stay in open areas the whole day and I was so bored. My aunt and my parents visited and it didn't go well. It was fine with my aunt but my parents said that I would have to pay for residential treatment. I was already having a bad depression day and that just made me feel worse. I already feel like a burden to them and that just made me feel bad. I was able to spend some time with friends and that made me feel better.

I hope tomorrow will be better.  Update: I am now not allowed to be in my room. I wanted to go to sleep but they're making me stay in open areas.

I had a meeting with my parents, my social worker, and my psychiatrist and it was really stressful and didn't go well. I wanted to self harm after but I talked to staff instead and they helped me. I made a new friend today and I'm becoming better at advocating for myself and talking to the staff when I need to. As always, I'm grateful for the friends I have here and the amazing staff. I honestly couldn't do it without them. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21727, distribution: 0.9233090059530378 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. It started out pretty good and slowly got worse. I felt positive in the morning but I slowly got more anxious as the day went on and my family meeting got closer. The meeting was hard and it made me really anxious for a lot of reasons. I felt really bad about myself today and struggled with self harm urges. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19841, distribution: 0.9221718050189632 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't great. There was a lot of drama this morning with one of the patients yelling homophobic slurs at people. My anxiety was pretty high. I isolated for most of the day. I don't feel great and I just want to be alone in my room but the staff won't let me. My doctor told me that she doesn't feel comfortable letting me leave or step down to a less restrictive program and that she'll start looking at state hospitals if things keep getting worse. I don't know what to do.

My friend and I did a puzzle for eight hours straight and basically never left our room. It was an okay day.

honestly, most days i feel lost, scared, and confused. but, right now, as i sip on my coffee in peace and quiet and write, i feel content.

for those in the midst of uncertainty and transformation, i hope you remember this:

even when you need rest, you are still powerful. even when it feels like you are not making progress, you are. you may not know how you will figure it out, but you will. healing often feels like breaking, but trust that you are breaking into something beautiful. you are on your way, and everything is unfolding the way it is meant to.

pay attention to who you are and how you feel when you're around people. the wrong people may make you feel shrunken down and anxious. the right people soothe your soul and allow you to be your authentic self.

it's okay to take a step back or disappear for awhile even if that means disappointing others or taking a break from things you love. prioritize yourself. the world can wait.

even when you feel broken, everything you need to feel whole is within yourself, not others. other people can add happiness to your life, but don't let them be the primary source of it.

not everything goes as planned, and that is okay. allow yourself to find grace and peace in the midst of chaos and uncertainty. be patient with the timing of your journey.

just because it feels like you might be going backwards doesn't mean that you are. allow yourself to think of your journey as a spiral, not a circle. even if it feels like you're starting over, this time you are starting with more experience.

july was a bit of a blur for me filled with some high highs and also a lot of low lows, but i'm grateful for the learned lessons and the opportunity to keep moving upwards and onwards. here's to a new month! and remember, no matter what august brings, you are still growing into the person you are meant to be 💌

This post is literally YEARS overdue, right? We've known about Holly and her green smoothies since day one, but let me tell you this: they're evolved a LOT. Natural selection and survival of the fittest at play, right there 😂✌🏻
-
So let's start with the foundations, because this is used as the base in all my smoothies: .- medium bananas (you can decide how many you add but the majority is always non-frozen), / cup frozen mango, / cup frozen pineapple,  cup plant milk (I use unsweetened soya most of the time) and *optional* protein powder (I usually use unflavoured pea, rice or hemp protein, but if I want to change it up then I use a flavoured one). I'll add just enough water to help out my blender, but I don't add too much as I like my smoothies thiccccc 😆
-
Once you've got good base, you can then get creative to change the colour and flavour! I'll go through my favs 😍
-
The classic green machine: The base plus  cup spinach,  tbsp hemp seeds and  tbsp maca powder 🌿
-
Purple bae: The base plus / cup frozen blueberries,  heaped tbsp rolled oats,  tbsp maca powder and  tbsp flaxseed powder 💜
-
Choc-nutty orange: The base plus  tbsp nut butter (peanut or almond),  tbsp rolled oats and - tsp cacao powder (you can use cocoa instead or even chocolate flavoured protein powder) 🥜
-
Sunshine yellow: The base but swap all liquid for coconut milk and then add  tbsp hemp seeds 🌞
-
Ocean blue: The base but swap soya milk for oat milk, I like to use vanilla protein powder in this one and then add blue spirulina powder (mine is from @unicornsuperfoods) 🌊
-
Obviously you can use your imagination and you really can't go wrong with making smoothies, but I'd like to think I make pretty good ones since I've been making them for such a long time now!

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

the ones who contemplate:

📚“Man, I wish i chose a different major.” 

🥾“I wish I chose a different life path.”

🖇“I wish I didn't take this job.”

ESPECIALLY if you see your friends or people that you know, or maybe people on Facebook loving the life that they chose. 

Here's a reframe to try out:  ✨There is something in that contrast that you would like for your own life. ✨

It's actually a blessing to have that feeling because it confirms there's something you actually want.

Your work is in learning how to shift your current life, into the life that you want to live. 

If you can see these comparisons as enlightening tools for you to identify what you want in your life vs. seeing them as “something I'll never have and I'm stuck with the lesser option,”

🦋I promise you, things in your life will start changing.🦋

if this speaks to you, i'm calling on my regret girlies who are READY to take action and to start loving their life.

it's actually way less about WHAT you do than you think, but it gives you so much more clarity ⭐️and direction🧭 to actually stick to what you want to do.

The thing to take you to the next level?

The course that will teach you how to be better?

The certification that will solve all your problems?

The program that will guide you to all your answers?

If you are… let's pause all the looking 👀OUTWARD and bring your attention ➡️inward⬅️

If there are any outstanding tasks, chores, items on your list that you've been holding off on, that's your work.

The things you've been avoiding out of fear or discomfort?

That's your work.

All those ⬆️ above totally can bring you to the next level 

AND also calling your mom more often can elevate your life in such a nourishing way.

Sticking to an exercise program (that you probably already bought but never finished) can get you to a whole other level.

So if you've been reaching for things outside yourself to level up,

Maybe it's time to reach within. And work on your basics.

i know it might sound extremely hypocritical because i HAVE a degree… 

but i've learned that there are MANY paths to success that don't require formal education. 

entrepreneurship, skilled trades, & creative fields are just a few examples of success that can be achieved without going to university.

some of the most successful people i know don't have a degree. 

👀some of the most successful people i know DO have a degree (or multiple)!!

👀👀and some of the most successful people i know who have degrees aren't working in that respective field

the problem is NOT the degree, higher education, status, etc. 

the problem is that we are forced to choose our “forever path” at the mere age of /, when we barely know ourselves! 

and then after undergrad, we “might as well” commit a few more years in a masters/doctorate degree. with little space to breathe or explore who we are outside of school. 

the problem is the shame of taking gap years, trade schools, or any other sort of “break” that can allow an individual to discover their strengths, passions, talents, etc. 

the problem is when we feel like we don't have the freedom to choose. as a double aquarius♒️, freedom is a strong core value. 

i want to make it clear that i'm not ANTI education, im ANTI being-forced-into-something-believing-it-is- the-only-path-to-success.

doing things without intention or purpose? no thanks!

the world is changing. you have options. 

if you got thrown through the education machine, got a “job” for the sake of it & need some help centering your life and actions around purpose…. 

i created my program for women just like you. the women i work with up-level their quality of life by gaining clarity on their big purpose, dropping their limiting beliefs, and building confidence with their inner voices and forward motion. 

📲Im only taking a few slots for my upcoming round in april. If you feel curious or even ready to take the next steps in taking charge of your life- let's chat!

Doc ID: 8967, distribution: 0.9458886199495073 ; The steps to becoming a registered dietitian:

- complete a bachelor's (or master's degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January , , a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an “Internship.” some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete  hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration's registration exam
- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. / of the United States require licensure to practice. 
- maintain continuing education -  hours every  years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the “nutritionist” title isn't regulated so there's no guarantee of the experience and education that they've had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients —and to the world. good (i say this because i can't blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

my own journey forced me to peel  back the layers of each fear-based belief because i felt stuck in a corner. 

and i remembered the saying, “the only way out is through”

over time, i realized these scary things all stemmed from a common-thread belief that didn't have much logic to support it. 

& when i finally did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

—

If these reframes are calling your name… I walk women just like you step-by-step through dropping their current stories (that keep them stuck in the same spot, or possibly running in circles, spinning their wheels) & rewriting their stories so they can finally be ✨HER✨

so they can finally heal themselves & heal the world.

My road is terraces for the first half of the street, then semis for the second half and at the end are a couple of small blocks of flats.

If you can't tell from the photo, I'm also under the sloping roof so I can't stand upright when I get out of bed. Now we have to decide what to do with the Moses basket which has been living at the end of our bed - providing useful storage as you can see. We don't need two baby sleeping spaces. (I see you social services, we only take ONE baby!) If the Moses basket goes, the snuzpod could live at the end of the bed when we don't have a baby, although it's taller and longer so might be too much in the way. Conclusion: we need more storage space for baby equipment

Today's run was just  mins steady pace. I listened to a podcast instead of music for the first time while running, and was pleased to find I could concentrate on it pretty well. I have actually got pretty good at running and don't know in what way I will carry it on when this training cycle is over. Maybe I'll follow a new training schedule to improve my km time.

She's doing pretty well really although she doesn't like to go past second gear (and I'm not complaining because the few times we got into third gear felt like we were going far too fast). We drove a few miles down a long quiet road twice and did a couple of loops of an estate. Driving instructors are heroes. I couldn't do that all day every day, my nerves would be shot.
