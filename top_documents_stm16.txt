Doc ID: 2619, distribution: 0.956430886702189 ; Are you afraid of eating higher calorie foods, untracked meals & weight gain? I used to be too... But let me explain why you shouldn't be üôà

Firstly, I want you to ask yourself  questions... 
‚ÄúWhat if I wake up in  years time a few kilos heavier than I am now?
Now ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat if I wake up in  years time still terrified of food?‚Äù 
Which is worse? ü§î

Secondly, high calorie / untracked meals DON'T equal weight gain. Eating at a caloric surplus consistently = weight gain. So let's just get that outta the way! üí™üèº

Significant weight changes don't happen overnight. It takes eating an excess of , calories on top of the amount of calories your body burns to gain a mere .kg of body weight which is usually distributed across your entire body... So no you won't wake up kgs heavier after overeating for a day or two. In fact, you really won't notice a physical difference at all!

When you do overeat, you may notice some initial temporary changes such as bloating & puffiness, but this is the body's natural response to receiving extra energy & it will go away after a few days! So don't go into a frenzy where you start punishing your body, eating less & working out more... Just ride the wave & give your body some time! ‚ú®

When you eat intuitively, it's normal for your physique & weight to fluctuate because you'll unintentionally overeat or under-eat sometimes, but so long as you're making healthy, balanced choices overall, it'll likely balance out in the end. If it doesn't & you end up seeing changes you're not % comfortable with, that's okay too!

Weight gain doesn't make you a failure, there's nothing wrong with fuelling & nourishing your body well! It doesn't happen overnight, just like weight loss doesn't happen overnight. So yes, you can tweak your eating habits slightly along the way to suit your goals, but there's so much more to life than counting calories & fearing weight gain. Trust your body & enjoy your life üíõ

This information is what has helped me have a more flexible & realistic approach to health & nutrition, so I hope it helps you too ü•∞

 not all eating disorders involve intention to restrict food or lose weight; not all eating disorders involve body image disturbances or body size preoccupation. not all eating disorders start with intentional restriction or weight loss, and many of them never involve these things.¬† anorexia nervosa can start with a flu bug. arfid is simply a phobic or aversive response to food. so-called ‚Äúbinge eating‚Äù disorder can start with being underfed as a kid.¬† eating disorders are at base about food avoidance and energy deficiency, and not for any one reason, or sometimes for any conscious reason at all. diet culture and fatphobia certainly inform the majority of eating disorders, so these threads of our socialization get inextricably bound up in the biological dynamics of the disorder. but if we continue to push only narratives about the desire to be thin, or for ‚Äúcontrol,‚Äù or diets taken to the extreme, we miss a significant segment of our population.

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.8949855686404992 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

Doc ID: 17177, distribution: 0.84720528835262 ; Question: What would be the symptoms of developing insulin resistance? üòü Answer: I don't think there would necessarily be any. Insulin resistance is more a biochemical and metabolic state that a persons body gets into over a long period of time ie months of repeated behaviours. Your blood sugar average would like be on the upper end of healthy. That's not great for the long term state of your organs and blood vessels. Insulin drives blood sugar into cells in order to control the level of sugar in our blood. If you become increasingly resistant to it, your body sends out higher and higher levels of insulin to keep your blood sugar steady. These high levels of insulin interact with other hormones and can mess them up too. It makes you more likely to gain weight, be more tired, periods can go wonky, have erratic moods, have low energy, more likely to have high blood pressure, basically anything can go wonky. In the end, your body can't send out enough insulin to keep blood sugar within a healthy range, and you end up meeting the diagnostic criteria for type  diabetes.The good news is that you can regain insulin sensitivity and even reverse a type  diabetes diagnosis if you manage your food behaviours, choices and intake.

 psa  stop telling people with eds that weight lifting will make them bulky. it literally, scientifically cannot make you bigger if youre in a caloric deficit. in fact, just doing cardio while losing weight has some really undesirable side effects, including: loose, saggy skinmuscle atrophysignificant decrease in strengthdecrease in metabolism speed due to muscle losslower energy levelsdecrease in endurance strength why won't it make me bigger, you ask? where's the proof? well, it's in the science. muscle cannot grow while in a caloric deficit, especially in one as extreme as we put ourselves in. while it can be strengthened and toned, it physically cannot grow without a surplus of calories. surplus meaning an extra - calories OVER your TDEE. if you ate this much and did weight training, you would see growth and a higher number on the scale. however, in a caloric deficit, you will only see a decrease in weight/body fat percentage and a higher lean muscle mass percentage, while looking smaller yet more tight and toned. muscle also burns around % more calories per hour than fat does. that being, having more lean muscle mass than body fat will increase your BMR and your metabolism even while idle. some benefits to weight training are: increase in strengthincrease in enduranceheightened metabolismlower body fat percentagehigher energy levelstight, ‚Äúfitting‚Äù skinboost in moods/emotional stability TL;DR, cardio alone may burn lots of calories in the moment, but in the end will not give you the results you desire. pair daily cardio with frequent muscle training and you will achieve the tight, toned, and yet thin and small frame look youre going for, along with better moods, a higher metabolism, and various other benefits. 

 THIS is like my biggest pet peeve ever. People have no idea how much work and food it takes to actually gain muscle mass, especially for women. Like, you don't accidentally just become 'bulky' and look like a professional body builder, so just stop worrying already.

Its like the coalescence of my entire ed, my bulimia. I dont fix binge eating by counting calories. I dont get out of a binge cycle by counting calories. Binge eating isnt about calories, its not about WHAT i eat its HOW i eat it. I can binge eat on fucking ice cubes. I need to address the mental and emotional problems that cause me to binge, not eat at so and so healthy amount or else. Eating a meal that is high in calories isnt the same as devouring food uncontrollably as i attempt to fill the void. I have to learn to eat comfortably no matter the calories in it. Dont bring calories into this. Thats just asking for failure. Fix the mind first, the body will follow after. Fix the mind first i wont have the desire to binge eat. Without the desire to binge eat my body can heal. The only reason calories are counted is for the desire to lose weight and undo the binging. That wont fix anything. Thats not recovery. Thats attempting to keep control over food. That mentality is still disordered whether i like it or not. Bro. Get real. Fixing my body before fixing my mind is the biggest waste of time and energy. Whats the point. Literally. What is the actual point.Im not excused from the laws of nature and the science of the mind. No one is. Logic before Ed. Im not special. My brain works like a brain and im not an exclusion to logic or even self awareness for that matter

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9673074668582619 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy‚Ä¶ I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born‚Ä¶ and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]‚Ä¶ and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 14454, distribution: 0.9641833476433321 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. ‚ÄúThis week's been a bit difficult‚Ä¶. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about‚Ä¶ uh, things I'd been holding all week‚Ä¶ and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.‚Äù I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong ü§îü§Ø hence‚Ä¶. the therapist is always right??

Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.9570195632042982 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less ‚Äútraumatised‚Äù viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said ‚ÄúI'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today‚Äù which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said ‚ÄúCan I just talk about something else?‚Äù. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked ‚Äúwhat's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it‚Äù I replied.  T looked at me.‚ÄùYeah‚Ä¶. that's magical thinking. How would they know?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.‚Äù T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before.

Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.9547096220411306 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said ‚ÄúI can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?‚Äù I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  ‚ÄúOk, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?‚Äù I nodded. T continued, ‚ÄúSo it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?‚Äù I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said ‚ÄúIt depends how brutally honest you want me to be?‚Ä¶. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!‚Ä¶‚Äù My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúnot normal‚Äù when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 14555, distribution: 0.9546255078446012 ; Therapy .. // an emotional pressure valve  T asked me how I was doing this week, after I was so upset all through last week's therapy session. I gave her a brief rundown of how the situation had been resolved and that I felt much better about it now. After saying she was glad it had improved, she said ‚ÄúDo you want to talk some more about that?‚Äù I said that I was frustrated about the timing of it, because if therapy had been on a Friday than it would all have been over by the time I saw her and I could have used my session for something more useful. In a way, I suppose I'm glad it happened when it did because it meant she did see me right in the middle of a triggered state, rather than me just telling her about it after it has passed.  ‚ÄúDid you know before we talked last week that you were triggered because it reminded you of your dad?‚Äù T asked. I nodded. T carried on, ‚ÄúWould it help if another time you spoke to H or a friend and said I'm finding this really difficult because it reminds me of my dad, and I need a bit of extra support?‚Äù I said that it wouldn't ‚Äúbecause I just need to push it down and it feels so unbearable that I can't even face speaking about it. If I keep it absolutely still, I can try and pretend that it doesn't exist and then I can carry on looking like I'm functioning‚Äù T pointed out that I spoke to her about it in therapy, and I said I didn't have much choice because I couldn't talk about anything else and so the only alternative would have been to cancel the session and I didn't want to do that. Two things come to mind when I write this out. The first is that when T suggested I reach out to H or my friend if a similar situation happened again, I felt so adamantly that there was no way I could do that. But gradually as that seed has been planted in my mind, it has felt more of a possibility. To be honest, I think I feel like I could not dump it all on H. I am the one that has the answers and the solutions, and I would only dump it on him if ultimately I had a solution as well. It would seem somehow unfair to put all my anxiety onto him and then not leave it in a nice tidied up place at the end.  The second thing is that I felt safe talking about it with T because I know that she can contain whatever I bring to therapy. She can't help with a practical solution and so that takes that pressure off needing to end the conversation with taking all my anxiety back to myself. In this way, talking to T is like a one-way pressure valve that relieves a bunch of emotional pressure and then shuts again at the end of the session. Whereas I imagine talking to H would be like the two of us shut in a closed system and when I release a load of emotional pressure, it just expands and bounces around in the box, squashing us both. I think I'll talk about those two things in therapy next week.

Doc ID: 15572, distribution: 0.9542100054328037 ; Therapy .. // emotional intelligence  After we'd talked about retraining my brain for  minutes (instead of the  minutes I'd planned!), there was only time to bring up one of my two remaining topics. I pushed ‚Äúfaulty thought patterns‚Äù on to next week - it's been pushed on so many times now anyway. And part of me doesn't want to jump into it at all anyway. I explained how I'd been thinking about therapy from the week before and it suddenly occurred to me how differently my mum and I see my children's relationship with my dad. My mum pushes them towards him, whereas I try and keep them away from him. My mum seems to think that she can create a relationship by pushing them into proximity with each other, whereas I am trying to prevent their relationship being destroyed, by keeping them away from each other. Not only that, but I feel physically very anxious when any of my girls are one on one with my dad. It's more a trigger from my own childhood but some of it is also based in current reality. Sometimes I even have to leave the room because it stirs up so much anxiety in me that I can't bear to sit there and watch it play out.  My mum is oblivious to how much anxiety my dad generates in me. T said ‚ÄúYour parents aren't emotionally intelligent. They couldn't or wouldn't understand how you felt as a child. They couldn't imagine what was going on inside you. But you are emotionally intelligent. You are doing things differently. You think about how your girls are feeling and you respond to that.‚Äù I usually agree with my mum on everything so it's strange to think about this stark difference in how we behave. I said ‚ÄúIt's hard to think of my mum as having got something wrong‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Faith, you do know she got things wrong, because you have chosen to be intentional about parenting differently. We've spoken about that.‚Äù I sighed and nodded. T is right. It's just uncomfortable to have to face it again.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.944110386039859 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. ‚ÄúNo matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.‚Äù After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that ‚Äúok Faith, time is up‚Äù, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. ‚ÄúNo Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -‚Äú I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. ‚ÄúOK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh ok‚Ä¶ I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.‚Äù T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. ‚ÄúBut I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.‚Äù I thought for a moment and said ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶ that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?‚Äù T asked. Omg no‚Ä¶ slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. ‚ÄúNo! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.‚Äù I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just‚Ä¶. I'm just not ready to be without her.

It was quite an intense conversation and I was surprised when T said now we needed to do some grounding before we finished, because I had really lost track of time. She tried to ask about how d was getting on, but tbh that is another in depth discussion that there wasn't time to go into so I just pulled a wry smile and said let's not go there. T understood and said ok what would you like to talk about? I was still a bit spacey but eventually I pulled myself together enough to say something that was suddenly on my mind. ‚ÄúUh so you asked me what I would like to be different in my relationship with H, and I know we have ended up talking about the physical stuff, but I did have other stuff on my list too.‚Äù (The physical stuff was actually last on my list but it somehow came up first.) T asked me how many things I had on my list and did I want to read them out, just so they were said and T could log them. Then she paused and said, or did I want to text them to her, so she had them written down and didn't have to try and commit them to memory? I said yes I'd text them to her. That felt a bit more in control than reading them out right now. That was when T asked me what score out of  I'd give me and H's relationship, and I didn't think too much about it but just said ‚Äú‚Äù. Which I still stand by. We have a really good relationship in lots of ways and we are both committed to each other. T said it was good to remember it was an , so she knew we weren't looking at a marriage breakdown here. I replied without really thinking too much, ‚ÄúOh, no, we're not having a marriage breakdown‚Ä¶.. I just think H deserves someone nicer than me.‚Äù T sucked a breath in and said ‚ÄúOhhh hmmm, that's a big statement. And we don't have time to unpack it now.‚Äù I hadn't really intended it as a doorknob confession type thing, although that's how it ended up. I hadn't even thought about saying it beforehand, it just popped out of my mouth in the moment. I guess that's therapy for you, it creates an environment where these thoughts, that must be lurking in my mind somewhere, surface and get put into words. I don't know what T made of it but I'm happy to leave it unspoken about for now. She scheduled for next week and that's when I suddenly remembered that I'm not here next week because it's school holidays and we're away. I'd been so caught up in her being unexpectedly away last week (even though it didn't affect my sessions) and wondering whether she'd be back today, that I hadn't looked forward and prepared myself for not seeing her next week. Usually when it's a therapy break because I'm away, I deal with it pretty well, but this break feels like it's blindsided me a bit. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15251, distribution: 0.9430382157162951 ; Therapy .. // üëç  T's very first words after we'd logged in this session were ‚ÄúSo, how were the A-level results?‚Äù She caught me by surprise a bit as I had intended to start by talking about her reply to my text, and instead I found myself answering her question. She followed it up with a couple of other questions, and then she asked me how I was after last session. She isn't usually as directive as this, with question after question. If I didn't have my stuff to talk about, I would be loving it.  I ignored her last question and said ‚ÄúCan I talk about something else first instead?‚Äù She said ‚ÄúYes of course‚Ä¶. I just have a note in my diary that we would talk about endings this session, so I wanted to sort of tie up the loose ends from the last week first.‚Äù I nodded because I hadn't forgotten about the dreaded 'endings' talk, but I can't talk about anything more until I've got this said. I started, ‚ÄúI sent you that text about d's A-level results -‚Äú T interrupted ‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù. She sounded surprised. ‚ÄúI don't think I got it‚Äù ‚ÄúYes you did! You replied!‚Äù T scrolled through her phone. ‚ÄúOh yes! So I did‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, so, I didn't really like the thumbs up emoji for a reply. It felt like a brush off. Like I could have text you saying I was about to jump off a bridge, and you'd still have sent me a thumbs up.‚Äù T smiled ‚ÄúYes, I see your point. I'm sorry‚Ä¶ I think I was‚Ä¶ let me see, what day was it‚Ä¶ Thursday‚Ä¶ oh yes I was busy doing my course and I didn't really register what was going on with the A level results till much later on‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I think I just wished I'd not sent the text at all. I mean, I knew we were on a break so I wasn't expecting a big conversation. I just thought you might be wondering‚Ä¶ you know, because we'd talked about d getting her results‚Ä¶ so I wanted to tell you.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes I understand, I'm sorry. I get things wrong sometimes‚Ä¶. It's actually important that I do, that I'm not perfect, because that helps you learn that we can make mistakes and we can recover from them, our relationship can recover. And I can't deliberately make mistakes! So that learning has to happen as an experiential thing, it happens organically in the therapy process and that's when we can look at it and deal with it.‚Äù And that was that. The conversation felt done. I think it gets easier to cope with these ruptures and repairs each time one happens. A few years ago, it would have taken me the whole session to manage to say what I was upset about. It really would. It would have completely sent me out of my window of tolerance, my anxiety over telling T how I felt would have been paralysing. I can take comfort from seeing how I've grown, and even though it still means uncomfortable situations, I can face the discomfort and disaster does not occur.

Doc ID: 14442, distribution: 0.942484970015578 ; Therapy .. // is this part ? I've lost track   I was determined be thorough with all the screwy things my brain had thought as a result of my therapist saying she'd noticed that therapy was changing and the way she needed to be had changed. ‚ÄúWhen you were saying that, it felt to me like you were saying that I needed to move on with what I was talking about. Like, I needed to stop rambling and wallowing and going round in circles and you've had enough of me talking about my childhood.‚Äù T said that she wasn't saying any of that at all. She doesn't think we're going round in circles and if we're spiralling around something, it's that we're going deeper each time. She said that there would be ending at some point in the future but we would talk about it and it wasn't coming yet. But she also had heard me say that I was never going to end therapy and she knew there was an element of 'Faith is quite happy with this', and that she might have to push me towards and ending a bit, when it's time. I nodded ruefully. It's ironic that when I started therapy, I told her I would stay for two sessions and that would be it, and now  years later I'm still here and don't want to think about leaving. She said some nice positive things then, such as she knew I worked hard in therapy and that I always had stuff to bring to session. I smiled, and looked down and focused on drawing a pattern on my leg with my finger. ‚ÄúYou look like you're about to say something‚Äù T commented. ‚ÄúI'm deliberating whether to say it or not‚Äù I said, pulling a face. ‚ÄúGo on then, let's just say it‚Äù  I told her about what I did straight after last session when I was cross. She asked me if I'd done it again since then, and I shook my head. She asked me if I'd done another thing since then and I said no. T said ‚Äúok, sooo‚Ä¶ it was a blip‚Äù. She was ok about it. I said that everyone had coping strategies they used when they were feeling fed up or upset, and this was mine. I guess I was trying to justify it a bit, to myself and to T. It would be better if I didn't do it at all, but then nobody gets it right all the time. I'm going to go easy on myself over it.

Bottom layer: a selection of finger sandwiches, halloumi chips, smoked turkey crostini Middle layer: fresh cream meringues, flapjacks, millionaires shortcakes, mince pies, rocky road  Top layer: freshly baked scones with jam and cream This was meant to serve three people! There were twelve of us so we had four of these. We couldn't eat it all despite plenty of tea to wash it down with, so we have brought lots of it home. I tasted pretty much everything on here except the meringue and the mince pie, and I ate a whole scone with jam and cream. I was mindful of how full I was feeling and still ate an extra sandwich at the end even though I really was full, because I needed something savoury after all the bites of cakes.

Answer: We make cheese-on-toast, which is toast with slices of cheese put on top and then grilled. Or we sometimes make cheese toasties, which is like a basic cheese sandwich that you can then put in a special bag that goes in the toaster to toast the bread and melt the cheese - or you can put it in a toastie maker machine. Is that similar to your grilled cheese sandwiches?

Doc ID: 7283, distribution: 0.6090494292935773 ; it's no secret that i read‚Ä¶a lot. if i didn't grow up an athlete i'd definitely say reading is my favorite sport. these past few months of stillness have been a blessing for my reading practice. i'm growing as both a reader and a writer! that being said, i wanted to share some of my book recs based on the type of reader you consider yourself to be in the current moment.

if you're just getting started: A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman is a great jumping off point if you haven't hit the pages in some time. it's relatively short with an easy-to-follow plotline. this is a very feel-good story! the author writes with simplicity yet so illustriously. 
**honorable mention: Turtles All the Way Down by John Green

if you need a thrilling plot: The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. you won't put this down. it's twisted and intriguing, with a remarkable plot twist at the end. this story follows two different character perspectives, so it requires more attention than a single-character plotline, but there isn't too much complexity to the craft here, which makes it less intimidating to read!
**honorable mention: The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah

if you're craft-crazy: All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. if you read and write often, the craft here will leave you breathless. there are so many intricate details that weave together in this piece that will bring you to a standstill. i read this months ago, and can still recite lines that left me speechless.
**honorable mention: City of Thieves and The th Hour both by David Benioff

if you're up for a challenge: The Secret History by Donna Tartt. this read is around  pages, but don't let it intimidate you. tartt is sophisticated and captivating, with characters development being a strong feature. this book calls for a highly attentive reader; there are plenty of subtle details that you may miss if you're not helplessly immersed in the story (which, i promise, you will be). i wish i could read both of her novels again for the first time.

It's one of the first songs I've written that really sounds like my own voice. I could never listen to songs about hope when I was at rock bottom. They felt bright and glittery and cheap. So I wrote a song that I could actually relate to, and I hope you find some resonance in there too. I've never quite been convinced by rainbows and sunshine words, so here's to what some friends have lovingly termed, ‚Äútenacious goddamn hope,‚Äù the kind that meets you in the trenches. Here it is: My Kind of Hope, co-written and sung with Carrie Welling.

Answer: College has been pretty good so far. I've made some really great friends and I like being able to choose my classes. I'm in my junior year but I'm on medical leave right now so I guess I'm technically a sophomore and a half. I'm majoring in psychology.

Primary school is - and secondary school is -, culminating in national exams in about eight different subjects, called GCSEs. Age - is sixth form (more exams called A-levels, usually in three subjects) or college (a range of more vocational and practical courses), and then after that is university if you choose.A typical school day runs from -.pm, and the school year runs from September to July, with  weeks off at Christmas and  weeks off at Easter. That divides the year into three terms each about  weeks long and in the middle of each term is a week off.

She's always dreamed of being a writer and I couldn't be more proud.   My girl (who writes openly about her story) has survived fundamentalism, an abusive childhood, an abusive marriage across the world, being a single mother, going to school  working full-time, and still trying to write. She is one of the deepest, funniest, most resilient people I know.  A few years ago, she got herself back to the United States and out of the abusive marriage on HER OWN, and is now raising her three-year-old son in a way that I can only dream to parent, with all the kindness and bravery she can muster. She also does advocacy work in her spare time raising funds for refugees, single mothers, and vulnerable people in the Muslim community.   I could write mountains about how much strength is in this one tiny person. But instead I'll just say this: keep your eyes on this woman. She's gonna be changing the world in big ways (and already is).  Go check out her  poetry .

Owning my actions has been a process, and I'm recognizing how those patterns helped me for time, but no longer serve. It's been painful to look back and see how my actions have harmed others, even while those actions were ways of trying to find safety and protect myself because of the trauma. It's not a matter of beating myself for the things I've done to try to survive - that helps no one. But now that I know better, I can do better. I can become aware of what triggers my brain to code someone as unsafe and act in self-protection, and once I'm aware, I can move towards doing something different. I can do my part in attempting to mend the relationships that I've broken.¬† My brain sometimes registers threats where there are none because of the trauma, and while my brain is trying to be helpful, it usually has me acting against my values as a way to keep myself safe from the perceived threat.¬† Trauma recovery isn't fun, you guys. There was a period of my life that I did a lot of things that I am not proud of. But to truly move towards wholeness, I have to do a lot of self-reflection and take ownership for my actions that are not in line with my values ¬†(balanced with understanding the function of those actions + giving myself grace for doing my best at the time). And you know what? I've found that it hasn't led to me hating myself more, but rather to more empathy for people who maybe are struggling to survive as well.

i don't share all my struggles every time i'm going through them because even though i try to show up on here authentically, i don't always want to be documenting and sharing every aspect of my life. i'm sharing this today for a few reasons though:

. it's okay and normal to feel all feelings. even positive people don't feel happy all the time.

. healing isn't linear, and even though growth is often compared to a blooming flower, that doesn't mean it's always pretty. just like nature experiences seasons and harsh winters, we experience them too.

. you never know what someone else is going through, so be kind to others and remember to check in with your loved ones even the ones that smile often, get all their tasks done, and seem the happiest.

no matter what you're going through or how lonely you feel, you are seen, you are loved, you are enough, and you are not alone.

you know how someone can tell you that you're smart, amazing, and beautiful  times, and you appreciate it in the moment but it doesn't really stick with you, but someone can tell you that you're incapable, worthless, and ugly, and it stays with you for years?

think about the impact it could have if you get told mean things constantly, and then realize that the way YOU speak to YOURSELF matters.

i share a lot about self love and taking care of yourself, but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't share about my hard days too. i've mentioned that i've been struggling a bit lately, and if i'm honest, a lot of my struggling has had to do with my mindset and me not giving myself the love, kindness, compassion, and care that i need. this season of life has been rough for me in a lot of ways that feel out of my control, but how i treat myself is something that is in my control, and i can either be my own best friend or my own bully.

at the end of your life, your body and your mind will have been with you through it all, and that in itself is pretty freaking incredible.

üíÉPHYSICAL WELL-BEINGüíÉ

Caring for your physical well-being is a crucial component of living in alignment with your purpose. 

When you are at your best physically, you have the energy and clarity to pursue your passions and make the most of each day. 

By taking care of your body, you set yourself up for success and ensure that you have the foundation you need to live a fulfilling life filled with purpose.

I work with my : clients to not only (re)discover their purpose in life, but to set up their daily routine to be able to receive and c o n t a i n their sacred mission.

They start to understand that the more clear and healthy our body is, the more aligned it is to receive the next steps to live your purpose!

I help career women up level their quality of life by gaining clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices and forward motion.

- what kind of person do you want to be?

- what do you actually want?

- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

i invite you to journal on this to really get clear on what you want.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there. 

if you've been wanting to finally make some moves to live a fulfilled/nourishing/purposeful life, i help women do just that! working with me, they gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices.

Ashtanga has  different series that are followed the same each time that focuses on moving into each posture with the breath. I love the structure of it and the fact that even if you memorize the whole series, theres always something to improve on, somewhere we can go deeper. I love how when it all comes together, it looks like a dance. More importantly, it feels like a dance I am having with myself. Breathing with me, feeling every part of me, trusting myself to go deeper, trusting myself to take a break and breath, embracing each drop of sweat and each pull of my muscles. I find myself falling in love more and more with each step of the dance. #rishikesh #rishikeshdiaries #applesandamandas #travel #india #yoga #rishikeshyoga #yogaeverydamnday #ashtanga

Topic 8 : 
top terms: body, look, real, skin, photos, happy, bodies, beautiful, media, comments
amin: obsession with body (or the opposite); like/love the real body/self

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.9725206127126473 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of ‚Äúoh, they're human!‚Äù or ‚Äúyay, she looks like me!‚Äù And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw üå∏

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday üåª 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same üíñ

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram ‚Äî swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) ü¶ã 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

üå∏ people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC üå∏

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

‚ù§Ô∏è your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
ü•ô your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? üí™üèº 
ü¶† half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? ü•∫
üß¨ while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .‚Äù, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible ü§Ø

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way üíõ 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A ‚Äúbad body image‚Äù day can triggered by many things‚Ä¶ One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden‚Ä¶ üí• a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into ‚Äúfeeling slimmer‚Äù or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much üòÖ slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! ü§Ø (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)üåª

‚Äúüôã‚Äù in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

‚ÄúIf we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame‚Äù - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play‚Ä¶ Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you üíõ

Doc ID: 2469, distribution: 0.9633025844961751 ; ‚ú® When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change ‚ú®

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER ü¶∏ 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently‚Ä¶
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems ‚ÄúInsta-worthy‚Äù or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a ‚Äúgood‚Äù photo & the right made a ‚Äúbad‚Äù one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens üí´

So often people joke about ‚Äúgirls on Instagram VS girls in real life‚Äù or catfishing in general‚Ä¶ These jokes are based around people looking better online than they do in real life because they post images they feel good in, with their hair & makeup done, their bodies posed perfectly to look ‚Äúflattering‚Äù & aesthetic VS how they may look in their everyday lives without makeup, with messy hair & all the little things we've been told are flaws like cellulite, breakouts, rolls, body fat üôÑ

The thing is, you don't have to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù all the time‚Ä¶ ALL OF US have our days where we haven't done our hair, makeup, we're feeling super bloated, etc. That isn't a bad thing. That doesn't make you a catfish, less beautiful, or less love-able. That is literally just part of being human!!!

I, for one, used to be SCARED to see people in person, because I only ever posted my very best photos & I felt I couldn't live up to that version of me in real life‚Ä¶ Whereas now, I realise I don't owe anyone ‚Äúperfect‚Äù & I can just be me, however that looks. Nobody is judging you as much as you judge yourself, they're all focusing on themselves! The only approval you need is your own‚Ä¶ Being comfortable in your skin is pretty much a superpower!

Don't let your mind (or anyone else's) bully your body & determine your happiness/confidence.

I post these every Monday just to remind you: not to compare yourself to strangers on IG, that the real you is so very normal & worthy of your own kindness, to show you why you shouldn't compare yourself to strangers on the internet, and to show up on here with the same features you may see in yourself & usually feel alone on.

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

üåü Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
üåü Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
üåü LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world ü•π I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same‚Ä¶ Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
üåü Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
üåü Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you‚Ä¶ 
üåü If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key ü•∞
üåü At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us üíÖ It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible ü´∂

Did you know that Dylan takes all of my 'Real Me Monday' photos? But would you also believe there was a solid FIVE years at the start of our relationship where I wouldn't let him see my body at all?¬†

At the time, it was so deeply engrained in me that I wasn't worthy of being seen or loved the way I was. I didn't want him to see that my body was soft instead of firm, that my legs were covered in cellulite, the way the loose skin on my tummy sagged when I bent over slightly or that my tummy was bigger than my chest.

The issue was never him, or anyone else, it was my own body image & all of the messages I'd taken as ‚Äúfact‚Äù over the years about what was acceptable & what wasn't.¬†

Dylan's always told me he loves me exactly the way I am, that he'll love me just as much when I'm wrinkly all over. But it doesn't matter how many people tell you you are something, because YOU have to believe it for it to have any merit.

Nobody else sees you the way YOU see you. The people who really love you will only see your body as the beautiful, ever-changing flesh sack that homes your soul.

It saddens me to think that for  years of my life, whether I was at my largest or smallest, I really believed that the real, unposed, relaxed, soft version of my body (in the above photos, on the right) were any different or less loveable than the posed, ‚Äúperfected‚Äù, sucked-in version of my body (on the left).

Remembering this time in my life is heartbreaking, but it's also a beautiful reminder‚Ä¶¬†
ü™û You are so much more than your body or the way that you look.¬†
üè° It is possible to create a better relationship with yourself so that you feel comfortable in your skin.
üíó You are not loved for your looks, you are loved for your heart.
üëã It's okay to let go of the beauty / body expectations we grow up around.
üíå Embracing your true self & being authentically you will inspire so many others around you without you even knowing it.
ü´Ç You (& your body) are already worthy of being seen & respected.

Doc ID: 2542, distribution: 0.9523342548285494 ; Having positive body image isn't believing your body looks good, it's believing your body IS good, regardless of how it looks! ‚ú®

And when you start believing your body *is* good, it makes it a whole lot easier to feel more confident, comfortable & appreciative of that body. 

‚ÄúBut how do I start truly believing my body is good?‚Äù you might be wondering‚Ä¶

Well, your mind is a powerful tool. So when you declare something, your brain looks for evidence to confirm it. So if you declare: ‚ÄúI'm not good enough‚Äù, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative reinforcement & critical self-talk. But if you just shifted your mindset & put your energy into more positive thoughts instead, that could change your life.

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

The next time you speak down to yourself, know that ONLY YOU have the power to give yourself kindness & positivity. Your body image is a reflection of your mindset, it's influenced by what  you believe & all of the messages you tell yourself. Some of those messages will be influenced by external sources like the media, your family, friends etc but it's up to you whether you take those opinions on as your own.

For me, I'm no longer telling myself I'm only beautiful when I'm sucking in, hiding away & portraying perfection. I'm choosing to accept myself as I am & because of that, I'm constantly seeking everything in my life that reinforces that thought, I'm constantly seeking the magic in myself, and I believe it now, my body is good, it keeps me healthy & safe. It's my home ü•∫

You have the power, never forget that üíõ

Leave a ‚Äú‚ûï‚Äù in the comments if you're going to focus on positive reinforcement, positive affirmations & positive self-talk this week ü•∞

Doc ID: 2490, distribution: 0.9504698928465097 ; There are more than  MILLION results when you search for ‚Äúhow to get rid of belly fat‚Äù on Google.
More than  MILLION when you search ‚Äúhow to get rid of loose skin‚Äù
More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of stretch marks‚Äù
More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of cellulite‚Äù
More than  million for ‚Äúhow to get rid of hip dips‚Äù
The list goes on. [ad]

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. Do you have to LOVE them? No of course not, but these features are human.

Let's approach them one by one‚Ä¶

Belly fat: a layer of fat is vital for a healthy, functioning, fertile body. It's essential that the human body has some, you would not function without it. It serves to absorb vitamins, store energy, protect & insulate your body. 

Loose skin: is due to your skin stretching at some point‚Ä¶ It will likely tighten up again slowly over time depending on how much you have. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's something to be in awe of!

Stretch marks: AKA a beautiful purple/pink scar that shows you how much you've grown. Almost everyone will have stretch marks at least once in their lives as we all go through a growth spurt from child to adult.

Cellulite: more women have cellulite because the structure of our connective tissue is different to men, which causes our skin to dimple where theirs doesn't (as much).

Hip dips: the appearance of hip dips is due to your BONE structure & the shape of your pelvis. If all of us could see our skeletons, we would see an indentation where the hip bone meets the top of the thigh.

(Even those who appear to not have any of them, most likely do!!)

Here's a proud video of mine, along with showing you how easy it can be to ‚Äúhide‚Äù these things online which is why we don't see them very often, but I promise you are definitely not the only one with them üåü

The more we see it, the more we normalise it ü•∞

At : I hate my body, I wish I looked like I did at .

At : I wish I FELT the way I did at . I wish I wore a bikini in my s. I wish I went out more in my s. I wish I didn't spend so much time being hard on myself and instead, appreciated what I had at the time.

Body image is not about how you look, it's about what you think and how you feel.

(I believe the first part is quoted from @thebodylovesociety but I changed a few things for this post)

I don't want my whole life to be shaped around what shape my body is.

I didn't want to spend another day comparing myself to others and only accepting myself if I looked a certain way.

I don't want to look back on my life and regret turning down fun invitations or photos with loved ones or wishing I could do things differently.

How about you? ‚Ä¶ Let this be the motivation / inspiration for you to be gentler with yourself this week! ü•∞

Sprinkle the comments with ‚Äúü§ù‚Äù emojis if you're going to make a deal with your current AND future self, to be kinder to yourself & try to live your life more aligned with the things that make you happy & less aligned with the unrealistic expectations you have grown up believing you had to live by.

When we stop focusing on the way we look, we create space to make our lives bigger. Happy Real Me Monday üíó

-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (üòâ), let's talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg ü§© It's not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip üèù
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our ¬£ a night hotel room . . . ¬£ you guys!!! üò± It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)üëåüèª
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay üëèüèª
-
üáπüá≠ Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you üôà They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
üáπüá≠ Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point üòÜ . . .
-
üáπüá≠ The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up üòÇ It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it üôåüèª
-
üáπüá≠ Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great üòÖ
-
üáπüá≠ I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing ü§® There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok üòè).
-
The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes üëèüèª please üëèüèª

We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push ü§® ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.
-
Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! üòÖYou cannot win with British people I'm afraid.

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :) 

roasted sweet potato & chickpea warm grain bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted sweet potato, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- diced red onion
- crispy chickpeas (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for  hours
- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
- cup each of diced carrots and celery
- bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
- cups water
- cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don't stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

In order to get both babies up, fed, changed, dressed, fed again, bags packed up and baby  dropped off with friend in time for me to get to the hospital with baby , I had to start the day at .am.  Thankfully we made it all on schedule. Two babies is physically exhausting compared to one (obvious I suppose but it's easy to discount the double exertion involved.) It's like running a km but using all the energy of a km. Two babies and an oxygen cylinder (it is NOT ‚Äúlighter than air‚Äù - it is actually very heavy!) in and out of car seats, in and out of the house, in and out of the car‚Ä¶. We all made it home for .am, just in time for me to eat breakfast (üëç) then take d to her friend's house to head off to Greece for two weeks, lucky girl!

Just got a killer sore arm, which I also had the first time round. I don't know what others think, but anecdotally the Pfizer does seem to cause more of a sore arm than the AZ. And I've heard more reports of the AZ causing generally flu-ey symptoms than the Pfizer.  So anyway, I feel ok so far. Which is good because I'm back to work at the vaccine clinic this afternoon.

-  tsp vanilla extract‚Ä®
-  cup gluten-free flour blend

-  tsp baking powder

- chocolate chunks for mixing in‚Ä®‚Ä®
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave‚Äî all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

Topic 14 : 
top terms: work, long, getting, family, come, stay, maybe, working, finally, job
amin: could have been a good fused topics but it is more like a junk topic :( 

Doc ID: 19580, distribution: 0.5488856968905381 ; Question: What does your unit look like? Does it look like an actual hospital?  Answer: It doesn't really look like an actual hospital but it is less homey than other units I've seen. The patient rooms are much nicer and we don't have a ton of medical equipment around. I think it mostly looks like a hospital because of the fluorescent lights and giant nurses' station in the middle of the unit. The unit I'm on is newly renovated so it's very nice and modern but it's also more clean cut and sterile looking if that makes sense. The other short term unit at this hospital is older and looks less like a hospital than my unit. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19234, distribution: 0.5422170166018383 ; Question: Do your parents pay out of pocket for you to stay inpatient? I work for an insurance company and patients are only authorized to stay at inpatient units for a short time before we insist on a state hospital.  Answer: I'm not really sure. The state hospitals are not accepting new patients bc of COVID so I have no idea what's going on. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19578, distribution: 0.5135383039978466 ; Question: Are you on the same unit as last time or were you on that other unit you mentioned?  Answer: I am on the same unit as last time (I've been on this one three times now). They try to send you to the same unit each time because you know the staff and they can keep you with the same psychiatrist but sometimes they can't depending on where there are free beds. I've had friends who have been on both units and they said that the other unit has more areas for lounging and feels less clinical. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19283, distribution: 0.5107162825184296 ; Question: How have they not sent you to state yet? I've never heard of insurance covering someone to stay this long in inpatient and not saying time to go to state. Like at some point they say enough is enough clearly that place isn't helping you and probably just enabling your behavior. Unless are you paying to stay there?  Answer: I am on the waiting list for the state hospital but I am not close to the top of the list and the hospital is also not accepting new patients because of Coronavirus. I'm not sure what's going on with insurance. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19673, distribution: 0.5096969337296902 ; Question: What is a state hospital exactly? I'm not from the US  Answer: A state hospital is funded by the government and is for more long term care. I am technically on a short term unit for acute stabilization but ‚Äúshort term‚Äù means different things for different patients. Sometimes it's a few days and sometimes it's a few months.

Doc ID: 11235, distribution: 0.5011736804930952 ; Full Ab Workout to feel the üî•
Exercise  // Yoga ball sit-ups //  minute
Slow and controlled sit-ups are much more effective that those that are super quick and poorly done. If you're doing them correctly, you might even start to shake when you are contracting at the top of the sit-up!
Exercise  // V-sits with or without a kg weight //  reps
I find these super difficult (watch my face at the end üòÇ), especially because you have to stay balanced! But the aim is to twist as far round to each side as possible. Focussing on the weight or your hands as you twist really helps. 
Exercise  // Plank // Hold for  minute
Make sure your arms are forming a right angle and if you place your palms facing upwards, you should hold less tension around your neck and upper body. 
Exercise  // Plank toe taps and dips //  seconds each exercise
Don't let your lower back collapse and keep your abs as tight as possible.
Exercise  // V-sits //  minute
The aim is to extend and pause to hold for a second, and then crunch inwards, again holding the contraction at the top for a split second. Balance is again key to this one!
Exercise  // Side plank with variations // Hold each side for  seconds,  dips each side,  seconds leg hold each side
Throughout this whole sequence, keep thinking about trying to lift your hips up as far away from the ground as possible. 
Repeat the whole workout  times üí™üèª

Honestly I haven't been doing great, which is why I haven't been posting much. I had a family meeting this week and also got some more information about my diagnoses and cognitive functioning so I've been trying to process that. I'm just having a hard time finding the motivation to do the things I know will help me feel better. I should be starting ketamine soon and I know I keep saying that but my treatment team finally got all the paperwork and insurance stuff done so we're just waiting for the program director to set up an appointment. I'm really hoping that the ketamine will give me the little boost I need to fully engage in treatment.

This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).¬† A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.¬† On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian¬†counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode.

 I found my old treatment plans from Renfrew: ‚Äúclient presents with an avoidance of vulnerable emotions; is quick to anger to feel a sense of power‚Äù   okay. I have PTSD; avoidance is LITERALLY one of the diagnostic criteria for that. As for anger, I wasn't being heard & was shamed at every turn for trauma responses. My anger was self-protection & survival. Any clinician worth their salt would approach that with compassion. oh, but this next part: ‚ÄúClient endorses trauma response to one staff member she has ‚Äúcoded‚Äù as unsafe.‚Äù  Yeah, see my brain did not *choose* to code this staff membee as unsafe. She was connected to things associated with my trauma. That was mocked. Anyway, fuck Renfrew.

But yes, I miss aspects of it. And some aspects of it that I miss now, I know I would be wishing I didn't have if I was working at it. The rhythm of going out to work and of coming home, the feeling of doing important work out there and then coming home to relax. Being part of a team, using my clinical skills, connecting with patients, the puzzle of working out what's going on with a patient, making a difference. I miss those bits.

I'm just asking to please not post things that are ‚Äùbonespo‚Äù ‚Äúthinspo‚Äù ‚Äúana recipes‚Äù or anything else PRO eating disorder, in tags that people in recovery or people wanting to recover are in. it can bring disordered behavior back and encourage it, even if you arnt intentionally encouraging eating disorders. It's very inconsiderate and cruel and harmful. Please stop. Pro recovery for others is not putting thinspo in a recovery tag. 
Honestly. Its so annoying having to swim through proana bullshit because bitches cant keep to their own fucking tags. Now all of us trying to get better are forced to see their shit! Constantly!Stay the hell out of any recovery related tag unless you are posting about recovery. not pro, just for meShut the fuck up!!!!
