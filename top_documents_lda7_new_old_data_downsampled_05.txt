Doc ID: 3816, distribution: 0.9781679895304222 ; Question: Are you managing to keep using therapy to work on the same things you were pre-pandemic? All I can think about is the virus and lockdown and how much it's impacting my mental health and I'm so mad about having to spend so much therapy time on it every single week but I can't think about or concentrate on anything else  Answer: No not really. Pre-pandemic we were deep into some work about my attachment style and my relationship with H. Then the pandemic came and completely threw me off for a few sessions. I had a full session when we tried to talk about H and I, and I couldn't focus at all and we just kept coming back to the virus. The week after that I asked T if we could just do a half session because I knew mentally I wasn't in a place to do therapy work, and it was mostly a check in. The week after that we did another half session, but we did get a bit deeper into stuff and it felt like we could have carried on for the full session. Then last week we did a full session again and we did do therapy but we didn't talk about the stuff we had been in the middle of pre-pandemic. That stuff felt a bit irrelevant in current cirucmstances. Instead we talked about some new stuff that came out of talking about my eating and intake.I'd say just go with what's on your mind, if that's the pandemic, then allow yourself to talk about that and process everything that's coming up. Maybe once you've let yourself do that you'll find that your mind starts to feel more open to discussing other things again.

T said ‚ÄúThat first year, therapy was very challenging for both of us - uh, for you, I mean. It was so hard, wasn't it? Every week, I wasn't sure if you were even going to turn up.‚Äù Before she has commented that I always looked like I was having a hard time just staying in the room with her. That's the horrid thing about avoidant attachment. I wanted the relationship but I was simultaneously terrified of letting her get close to me. Parts of me were screaming out for someone to look after me, but bigger parts were telling me to keep safe and stay away.

It's infuriating to see you keep using being busy (which hello, lots of people are and they still manage to eat) as an excuse not eat properly - and then to have the audacity to humblebrag about it on here where you know lots of your followers are probably anxious about eating too much or worrying they're not active enough.   Answer: Ah anon, calm down. I never said I was perfect. I'm trying to find the balance in life as much as the next person. Being busy does make it difficult to find time for proper meals and I'm sure I'm not the only person to feel that way. Sometimes eating lunch becomes grabbing a slice of fruit toast before a run, and a handful of cashews when I get back just as the baby is waking up from her nap, because I have to choose between going for a run in the sunshine or spending  minutes making and eating the sit-down lunch I would choose to have - because bizarre as this might seem to you, once up and awake the baby will not just sit for  minutes peacefully on her own with no demands of me.If there's any of my followers who are tracking my food and trying to emulate me, let me tell you that I had homemade macaroni and broccoli cheese and  slices of bacon for tea followed by a Cadbury's mini roll. And I've just drunk a large glass of wine.

I haven't done a big food shop in a supermarket for so long as it is (I've been doing online for a couple of years now), never mind with the current conditions on top of that.

While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.

‚ú® the  year old version of you ‚Å†
‚ú® the  year old version of you
‚ú® people who are curious about the things you are but don't have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
‚ú® people who your message will inspire and change
‚Å†
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

Doc ID: 9567, distribution: 0.9901555533243486 ; every relationship is different, but one thing i've come to learn is that no one can be everything to you.

expecting otherwise is a quick path to resentment.

i used to expect boyfriends in the past to make me feel happy, to make feel worthy, and to make me feel good about myself and my life, and when they couldn't, i'd put the blame on them. it wasn't until i took responsibility for my own life and happiness that things began to change.

as  is coming to an end, and people are looking forward to  being their ‚Äúbest year‚Äù, i hope you recognize that nothing will change if nothing changes. you won't magically start thriving even with the love and support of someone else unless you prioritize taking ownership for your actions, cultivating self-love, creating new habits that support your growth, facing your inner challenges and discomfort, learning to trust and surrender, and feeding your dreams.

strong healthy relationships can make the biggest difference, but the best thing a friend, partner, or family member can do isn't be our number one fan, but help support and encourage us to become our own number one fan.

takeaway: that person you keep searching for to make you happy? it's you.

when i work with my clients in my purpose coaching container, i walk through questions like this because those deep desires and what excites them act as breadcrumbs to their purpose.

so if you can figure out just WHAT you want, you're already on the way to get there.

Doc ID: 10376, distribution: 0.9727814668843319 ; Fun fact about me: I eat some sort of dessert (the full fat and sugar kind, not a clean version of one) every. single. day.  Why? Because I like it, and it keeps me mentally sane.  BUT, I also eat plenty of ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù foods throughout the day.  People used to look at my previous Instagram (when I didn't post any of the healthier things I eat) and assumed I only ate unhealthy and that I only looked fit because I was blessed with good genes.  I've also had other people in real life seeing me eat a lot of healthier things and make comments about how I probably don't actually eat the stuff that I post (btw, I will never post something I don't actually eat). Why do so many people think that being healthy or unhealthy is an all or nothing thing? It % isn't.  A healthy person can give themself a treat every day and still be considered healthy, and an unhealthy person can eat a salad every day, and still be in bad health.  I'm not telling you that you need to go eat a slice of cake every day to be have balance- everyone's body's needs and desires are completely different. But also, life is not an all or nothing experience. So, I encourage you to (as hard as it is) let go of all your food rules and restrictions and just live life in moderation because as I always preach, balance is everything!

i get it. maybe you ate more or differently than you usually do the past few days. maybe your body's reacting to it. maybe your pants are tighter than they were last week- mine are! THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO RESTRICT OR DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY TO ‚ÄúMAKE UP‚Äù FOR IT.

our bodies have our backs, they know how to handle extra food, and they are very good at self-regulating ~balance~!

if you are wanting to continue eating more than you were before or are thinking about food a lot, instead of thinking you're wrong for your thoughts and desires, consider that maybe you weren't eating enough. you can still be restricting even if you're eating what you think is ‚Äúenough‚Äù or even more than ‚Äúenough‚Äù, and mental hunger is still hunger that deserves to be honored!

if those ‚Äúextra pounds‚Äù don't eventually come off on their own or you gain more weight, instead of immediately judging yourself and thinking that you need to lose them, ask yourself why you think that, consider the fact that maybe it was ‚Äúmissing‚Äù weight instead of ‚Äúextra‚Äù weight, remind yourself that weight gain is not inherently bad or unhealthy, and remember that your worth is CONSTANT no matter how your body changes (spoiler alert: it's going to) throughout your life.

your body just wants what's best for you, and you can trust it!! i promise!! the freedom that comes with trust, acceptance, and letting go is absolutely worth it ü§ç

I got a text from d in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said ‚ÄúCan you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.‚Äù Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an  minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn't pass üò≠. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn't a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I'd ordered wasn't there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn't ordered was there. So we made a profit of  packs of brioche,  packs of krispie cakes,  bags of crisps and  eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I'd sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d's medical needs, I was rather hoping my pm tutee would cancel, but she didn't. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D's bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I'm finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week's episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice.

Doc ID: 9744, distribution: 0.9657633363898934 ; opposite action is something that when i committed to recovery and trying to rewire my brain, REALLY helped me combat my negative thoughts and stop labeling my actions.

essentially, opposite action means deliberately doing the opposite of your harmful emotional urge.

if i had the urge to run, i would choose to get closer.

if i had the urge to isolate myself, i would choose to reach out to someone.

if i had a thought telling me that i ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù eat the chocolate cupcake, even if i didn't know if i really wanted to eat it, i would choose to eat the cupcake anyway with the goal of taking away the power from the food and transferring the power back to myself by making the decision.

this helped me eventually change the thought process from thinking i ‚Äúshould‚Äù or ‚Äúshouldn't‚Äù do something to thinking about if i do or don't WANT to do something.

initially, opposite action can feel really scary because it's literally going completely against what your thoughts want, but that's why it works. the more and more you do things that feel scary, the less scary they become, and the more you're able to actually tune into how you really feel and make the choice you really want.

Doc ID: 5045, distribution: 0.98427153517687 ; Greedy brain  After successfully giving myself permission to get fish and chips at lunchtime, that old familiar thing happened of my mind going a little crazy and subsequently wanting to eat All The Things. I didn't even finish my fish and chips because I was mindful of my fullness levels and  when I got to the point of just nibbling away because they were there, I wrapped the last bit up and threw them out. But the whole crazy brain thing is not related to physical hunger. It's a mental thing. Adult me goes offline and I guess that child I bought the fish and chips for is running the show. She wanted donuts. No, cake! No, chocolate! Everything! When we eventually left the beach, we called into Costa for a coffee and yes, the cake of some sort that my mind was yelling for. I had a raspberry muffin. I ordered the baby a toasted teacake, which I knew I would end up finishing off. (She surprised me in the end by how much of it she ate, there actually wasn't much left for me) Then I bought one of those darn birthday cake grenade bars and ate it after the muffin. Probably calorie wise added in to everything else I ate that day, it wasn't excessive. But it's the loss of control that bothers me. I'm happy I can let myself enjoy fish and chips but I'm not happy about what happens next. I do need to talk about this in therapy because I need maybe some of my therapist's words in my head or a plan for the next time it happens. I don't like it and I want it to stop. (I have written about this same phenomenon before. It was a couple of months ago and it was triggered by a cake that I allowed myself to have a slice of, and then couldn't stop thinking about eating/c&s the rest of the cake. Ongoing issue.)

Doc ID: 7126, distribution: 0.9953533664573267 ; Question: Have you been diagnosed with anything new recently? What's happening with your cognitive functioning? Hope things get better soon  Answer: I did neuropsychological testing and got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, unspecified eating disorder, and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorder. It said that my treatment team should look more into ADHD and PTSD to rule those out bc I could have those or maybe not. I'm still trying to figure out what the neurodevelopmental disorder means. The report also said that I do not have BPD but my treatment team says that we have to rule that out as well. I've received many different diagnoses over the years so basically no one knows what's going on.

Answer: i was only given the zyprexa as a chemical restraint during a dissociative episode. they are considering adding it on as one of my night meds in place of the seroquel that i'm already on. it'll definitely be hard. i'm trying to have an open mind about it but i know it'll be hard.

Doc ID: 6972, distribution: 0.9943819520623344 ; more nourishing plant based meal inspo as requested! üå±ü•£

a good dressing goes a long way, and there is no dressing more reliable than this one. i use it for nearly every meal i make and i'm not upset about it. a good dressing makes any bowl‚Äî is there anything tahini can't do? this is a rhetorical question of course :') 

this super simple yet nourishing bowl has been my work lunch lately.  i was in a meal rut for awhile but this got me out of it! the meal itself is super easy to prep in big batches and tastes amazing cold straight from the fridge, which saves me so much time on busy days. you can pack it up and take it to go too üòå 

feel free to sub whatever vegetables or grains you have available. just don't replace the dressing! you can also add beans/lentils/tofu to up the protein. i like tossing temeph in my bowls if i have it handy!

quinoa broccoli bowl with garlic tahini dressing:

first blend the dressing:

- / cup tahini
- / cup lemon juice
-  tbsp dijon mustard
-  garlic clove
- / cup warm water
- sea salt

blend until smooth. place to the side.

roast broccoli florets tossed in EVOO and sea salt on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet at  for about  minutes, or until softened/roasted. while that's roasting, prepare quinoa on the stovetop following package directions. once both are done, toss in a bowl and coat with half of the dressing (these amounts make  servings i've found!) mix it up until thoroughly combined and well-coated. tastes great hot but even better chilled in the fridge!

I've never heard of insurance covering someone to stay this long in inpatient and not saying time to go to state. Like at some point they say enough is enough clearly that place isn't helping you and probably just enabling your behavior. Unless are you paying to stay there?

I'm not sure what's going on with insurance.

brown rice and lentil pilaf with caramelized onions:
i made this on a whim but here's what went down! i saut√©ed an onion in olive oil until caramelized and placed to the side. then i added some pre-steamed brown rice and pre-cooked lentils to a pot with enough vegetable stock to cover. i brought this to a boil and then reduced heat to low and covered, stirring occasionally until the liquid was all absorbed! at the end i drizzled in some balsamic vinegar, more sea salt, and threw the onions on top! .

 Girl. Yes. 
 
 The voices of little girls are so powerful and profound because they haven't yet been completely eaten away at by social conditioning.¬† 
 

 ‚ÄúI am a rich pie filled with knowledge. I will not be eaten.‚Äù Holy fuck my new motto.  
 
 Transcription (with original line breaks): 
 
  The true feminine  
  I am not sugar and spice and everything nice. I am music, I am art. I am a story. I am a church bell, gonging out wrongs and rights and normal nights. I was baby. I am child. I will be mother. I don't mind being considered beautiful, I do not allow that to be my definition. I am a rich pie strong with knowledge. I will not be eaten.   
 
 
 i'm not kidding, this poem shook me to my core. it inspired me more than any famous poet in the past few months. this little girl is going to influence the world in such a beautiful way. 
 

 little girls are gonna rule the goddamn world 
 


 This is why society works so hard to stifle girls and women.  


 This little girl has more talent in her little finger than every self-obsessed, ‚Äúbrooding‚Äù male poet who ever walked this earth. Epic.

Doc ID: 8148, distribution: 0.9936239500226409 ; yesterday on my commute home i came across a podcast about ‚Äúweighing what you want‚Äù. i didn't even listen to be honest. but the phrase caught my eye. i consider myself fairly immersed in the fields of health/wellness and body positivity, but never once have i heard this string of words. never once has ‚Äúweight‚Äù been up to us, something that we align with what we ‚Äúwant‚Äù. i instantly thought positively of this phrase. it was freeing to me, to think that if i want to be happy, i'll weigh the weight that will grant me this opportunity. but i acknowledge that so many people out there probably read ‚Äúweighing what you want‚Äù negatively, because what they want is fed to them by society. it makes me sad to think that there are men and women out there with a desire to look and weigh a way that they're taught to believe is beautiful even if it's unrealistic, unhealthy, and unattainable for them. i support weighing what you want, as long as you want to be happy and healthy. every person who struggles with an eating disorder is different. as obsessive as i was, i never weighed myself. so being forced onto a scale for twice daily weight checks while inpatient traumatized me; i hated that scale and how much control it had over whether i would leave the hospital or not. since then, i've sworn off of it. i don't see a need to attach a number to who i am, the life i lead, or what i'm capable of. we place too much weight on weight, when it's not nearly as influential as we allow it to be. weigh what you want.

 All women have pubic hair, all women have armpit hair, all women have moustache hairs, all women have hairy legs, most women have hair on their stomach and breasts. If you find that disgusting then you aren't attracted to women at all because that's how we naturally exist, that's what we look like, those are our secondary sex characteristics. Congrats on having brain rot though.

i don't share ‚Äúwhat i eat in a day‚Äùs because i personally think they are more harmful than they are helpful, but i'm all for sharing meal ideas, so save if you need some meal inspo!

lox bagel sammie (getting lox to add to my bagels for the week always feels like such a treat! add cream cheese, red onion, or whatever fix ins you like)

winter salad (greens tossed in olive oil, acv, maple syrup, and s+p w/ roasted brussel sprouts, roasted butternut squash, pan-seared chicken, turkey bacon, beets, and goat cheese)

steak and veggie stir fry with rice (steak marinated in soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, cornstarch, sugar, garlic powder, and salt)

burrito bowl w/ whatever protein, veggies, and flavors you like (the easiest mexican-inspired shredded chicken requires just  ingredients- chicken and salsa. add chicken and a jar of salsa to a slow cooker, cook on low for - hours, and shred)

protein oats (a bfast favorite of mine. i like to add vanilla protein to mine and top w/ frozen blueberries, dark chocolate chips, and nut butter)

lemon alfredo pasta w/ spinach and seared scallops (a fun switch up from my typical pasta w/ red sauce. sear scallops in a mix of avocado oil and butter for  min on one side and  min on the other)

avocado toast (a classic. i highly recommend the san francisco style sourdough bread from trader joe's. i topped mine w/ sea salt, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of evoo)

instant ramen w/ - min eggs and wilted spinach and baby kale (i like to make my own sauce with soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, and honey)

roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and butternut squash paired w/ air-fried chicken breast and goat cheese (this is a super easy meal that can be prepped ahead of time. veggies roasted at  degrees for about  min and chicken air-fried at  degrees for  min)

broccoli and kale slaw salad w/ pan-fried tofu (no shame in using salad kits for convenience! the broccoli and kale slaw from trader joe's is one of my favorites. i toss my tofu in soy sauce, paprika, and garlic powder, and i like to have a side of bread for balance and satisfaction)

Doc ID: 3861, distribution: 0.9902239182918612 ; Question: I'm not sure that you'll have any advice, but I figured its worth a shot. My mom passed suddenly right before all of this COVID stuff began. I'm only . We were able to have a funeral but basically the next day everything began shutting down. I am so sad all the time & I can't even see my friends. I'm seeing my therapist via video sessions but it's not the same feeling of safety as her office gave me. I already struggled with depression/anxiety, so I'm struggling to do literally everything now Answer: I'm so so sorry about your mum, anon. I think it is very normal to feel very sad, you are grieving. Be gentle with yourself and just let your feelings be. I'm glad you are still seeing your therapist and hopefully the video sessions will get easier as you get used to them. She is still there for you and will still be holding you in her mind. Don't set too many expectations for yourself, but do try and take care of yourself like you would for a friend or loved one. Try and feed yourself regularly with food that's easy to prepare and eat, let yourself rest, try and keep to a regular sleeping pattern. The worst of the grief will gradually ease but it takes time. Reach out to people if you can. Let them help you. Sending you love and best wishes x
