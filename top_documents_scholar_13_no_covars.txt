Doc ID: 8710, distribution: 0.9077152609825134 ; these things can realllyyyy hold you back from going for your purpose (are you doing any of them?)👇🏼

- expecting to be paid from their purpose 

- making sure everyone is happy with your life shifts

- not wanting to make a wrong choice… so you don't make any at all and perpetuate feeling stuck

- thinking that your sensitivity and empathy is a WEAKNESS, so you hide it and don't explore what it can actually do for you.

- forcing a path because it “seems” right, not because you truly FEEL in your body that it is the right move.

maybe this doesn't resonate with you right now (AMAZING!! congrats ❤️) but i know you can tag a friend who has been stuck in their current situation lately.

and i got a lot of answers about not having enough money💰, not being able to quit your job😓, etc. 

but the truth is that there is so much more to your purpose than your job🧳

it's actually way less about WHAT you do than you think, but it gives you so much more clarity ⭐️and direction🧭 to actually stick to what you want to do. 

i've helped dozens of women gain clarity on their big purpose, drop limiting beliefs, and build confidence with their inner voices and forward motion. and i'd love to guide you as well.

Doc ID: 8967, distribution: 0.817564845085144 ; The steps to becoming a registered dietitian:

- complete a bachelor's (or master's degree) in an ACEND-accredited program. master topics including: community nutrition, human nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, nutritional chemistry, lifespan nutrition, ethics, business management, finances, epidemiology, statistics, and more. *note*  effective January , , a graduate degree (masters or higher) will be required to become a registered dietitian. those who registered before will be grandfathered in.
- complete an accredited supervised practice also known as an “Internship.” some schools offer a coordinated program that combines the internship with the degree. in this internship, participants will complete  hours of experience in community nutrition, foodservice, and clinical nutrition
- study for, take, and pass the Commission on Dietetic Registration's registration exam
- *if applicable* gain licensure in your state of practice. / of the United States require licensure to practice. 
- maintain continuing education -  hours every  years

why am i sharing this? first of all, the dietetic career path has sparked the interest of many lately and i wanted to share what it takes to become one. second, there seems to be some confusion about nutritionists vs dietitians. i am not discounting the knowledge and efficacy of a nutritionist but i want to emphasize that when you see a *registered* dietitian, it is guaranteed that they have an extensive background of education and have trained especially in this field. the “nutritionist” title isn't regulated so there's no guarantee of the experience and education that they've had. a lot goes into what we know and share to our clients —and to the world. good (i say this because i can't blanket statement) dietitians know to follow the science rather than personal beliefs in practice, something that, again, is not guaranteed with others

Doc ID: 2338, distribution: 0.9821314811706543 ; The average person's screen time is  HOURS a day… and the scariest part of this statistic is that social media now has the most powerful influence on us. It's no wonder that upwards of % of people are unhappy with themselves & their body in some way. 

This is why I post these “Instagram VS reality” type of posts, because it's one of my most impactful ways to show how curated social media is, why we shouldn't compare ourselves to others & how our bodies can look different ALL THE TIME!

These photos were taken on the same day, minutes apart. On the left, I'm standing tensed & posed or with lighting that softens the dimples on my body making me look like I'd walk around with a toned body every moment of the day… But then, less than  mins later, when I relax, you can see that my body looks almost entirely different. 

Both bodies workout. Both bodies live a balanced lifestyle. Both bodies can wear cute activewear (I'm wearing the new @gymshark Elevate & Camo in all photos - 'BREE' for % off [ad]). Both bodies bloat, wobble & look different in certain angles, poses & times of the day/month/year. 

I used to compare myself & punish my body, striving for a body that doesn't really exist and/or isn't entirely healthy or sustainable for me.

But now I understand that ️⃣ everyone I see online, in the media or even in person might not be how they or their lives look at all times ️⃣ I understand that we are all built differently, with different lifestyles & habits, so we cannot compare ourselves to anyone ️⃣ I can now appreciate ALL bodies & especially my body for what it does for me, instead of the way it looks, and ️⃣ finally, I understand now that having fat on my body, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks, loose skin, belly fat (etc) is so normal, part of being human, not in need of “fixing”, shouldn't discourage me from continuing to do my healthy habits & overall it's part of my happy, sustainable, healthy balance.

Doc ID: 2377, distribution: 0.981503963470459 ; You don't have to be “that girl”. You just have to do what's best for your body & mind. Don't let trends or FOMO control your actions & life. You're worthy at every angle, every size & every stage of your life.

We've been taught to pick ourselves apart from a young age… But the good news is that something you've learned is something you can unlearn too. 
We live in a society where we're made to believe that our appearance defines who we are, with impossible standards on our TVs, social media, movie screens, magazines, etc. It's been said that we see at least  media images per day. That's at least  opportunities in a day to compare yourself & not feel good enough. 
This is scary since the messages you consume become you. The beauty standards you see & put yourself around - whether online or in the real world - are the expectations you normalise for yourself. This is why it's so important to fill your social media feed with diverse & REAL people who leave you feeling better, instead of worse!

I no longer opt in to consuming only filtered, airbrushed, perfected, edited & posed highlight reels. 

The  images I consume now are from people doing their best & showing up as THEMSELVES… with cellulite, rolls, body hair, mental/physical illness, love handles, stretch marks, body fat, uneven b👀bs, scars, moles, visible veins (the list goes on). All of which are very real human things that a lot of us experience. It's made me more accepting of myself AND of others. While I don't always relate to every post I see on my social media feed, I also no longer have this unrealistic, unhealthy expectation for my body or life.

Now I feel kinder & more thankful for my body for what it does for me, rather than the way it looks. Trust me, it DOES make a difference! Leave a “🎄" below if you're with me!! Happy Real Me Monday! 🫶

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.9786773920059204 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they're human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Here's your weekly reminder to not punish yourself or compare yourself to others 🙅🏻‍♀️

Comparing my body to a super strong athlete doesn't make sense… Because I don't train hours every day for sport or have a lot of muscle on my body burning through energy.

Comparing myself to a curvy goddess doesn't make sense either… Because that's not the way my body is built. I'm built like a door, not an hourglass & THAT'S OKAY 👌🏼 

Comparing my relaxed, everyday self to the posed & perfected photos of people online is setting myself up for failure… Because it's not realistic. Most people only post their very “best” photos & you can't compare your % to someone else's %. 

The point is: comparison is the thief of joy! Comparing yourself to ANYONE doesn't make sense… Neither does setting someone else's body as your “body goals” because we are all unique, with unique habits, lifestyles, genetics, stresses, sleeping patterns, health concerns & body types (the list goes on).

It's so important to fill your social media feed with diversity, so you never forget that beauty & bodies don't just look one way. Find people who fuel positive thoughts & don't leave you feeling worse! At the end of the day, your appearance is the least interesting thing about you. Here are some things that matter more:

🧠 Your mindset
🤗 The people you love
💭 The memories you make
🤝 Believing in yourself
🕺🏼 Creating habits that bring you joy & purpose
🧖🏻‍♀️ FEELING good in your skin
🪄 Creating a positive space in your own mind
🙌 Not being your own bully
🧘🏻‍♀️ Looking after yourself internally 
👑 Not letting your body hold you back from the life you want!

Now go have an amazing week celebrating everything that you are! Happy International Women's Day ✊💗

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

Happy Real Me Monday lovelies!

As a teenager, I often compared myself to other women EVERYWHERE I went... Whether it was online or in real life. All I wanted was to have a flat tummy and abs while also having curves, I thought bloating meant I was gaining weight, I researched how to get rid of my cellulite, I thought stretch marks were a flaw & that my skin had to be firm! I thought skinny meant happy... But it did not... Shocker! 🙄 You see, confidence isn't a one-size-fits-all. There are many women who are smaller in size who experience low self-esteem & a negative relationship with their body image. I did too! So this week's real me Monday is focused on showcasing the reality — NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU ARE, you deserve to feel confident & comfortable in your skin. Me being lean & living a healthy lifestyle doesn't mean all of those things I once considered to be flaws would automatically vanish and cease to exist. I lost kgs & I still bloat, my skin still isn't firm, I still have cellulite, rolls when I sit & stretch marks across my thighs. So don't for one second think that being 'thinner' or losing weight is going to help you reach happiness... You have to start embracing yourself NOW! Treat your body with kindness. You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love 🙅🏻‍♀️ REWIRE YOUR MINDSET BOO! 🥰

What is something you're going to make a conscious effort to start embracing? You're in complete control of how you view it! Let me know in the comments below! I'd love to cheer you on 🎉 

P.s. I've got some DELICIOUS new recipes up my sleeve for this week's recipe post to stay tuned 😉

 million results for “how to get rid of loose skin”

More than  million results for “how to get rid of stretch marks”

. million results for “how to get rid of cellulite”

. million for “how to get rid of hip dips”

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. To feel ashamed of them. But these features are human.

Most of the time, the internet (social media especially) makes people feel worse, rather than better 😅

It can negatively impact body image & sleep, increase bullying & FOMO, and lead to greater feelings of anxiety, depression & loneliness.

But that doesn't have to be your experience.

The messages we consume on a daily basis really do matter… and if the messages we're consuming are full of unrealistic expectations, highlight reels of people's lives, posed/edited photos, sunshine & rainbows, then we'll start to wonder why our lives don't look the same. And all of a sudden, our life/body/career/relationships aren't good enough. 

Don't get me wrong, the internet is an incredible tool, it's something I personally LOVE & sometimes what we see of others online is inspiring & can propel our mindset in a positive direction… But other times, it's self-sabotage… It makes us compare ourselves, feel incomplete & behind in life.

I think we underestimate how important it is to set healthy boundaries & be mindful of the content we're consuming every day.

Protect your peace. Fill your online world with content that makes you feel GOOD. Content that makes you feel seen. People who inspire you & empower you. 

And remember that social media isn't always reality, it isn't always the full picture (well, it NEVER is) so please don't be so hard on yourself. You're exactly where you're supposed to be at this point in time 🌻 

Happy Real Me Monday 🥰

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9736328125 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

A “bad body image day” can be triggered by many things… Sometimes it's seeing yourself in the mirror, sometimes it's sizing up or down in clothes, sometimes it's comparing yourself to others... Just to name a few. 

But a lot of the time, what you see doesn't reflect the reality of the situation. Whether that's in the mirror, trying on clothes or seeing photos online.

. You've only ever seen yourself in the mirror or in photos, so you will never actually see your true beauty. 
. Lighting, angles, posing, different lenses & mirrors can change the way we look — especially in fitting rooms. Some stores use mirror manipulation or softer lighting to hide lumps & bumps. Some stores use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... But in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!
. Sizing differs so much 😅 I size up & down depending on the store or fit! 🤯 (P.s. sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

You are not your size. You are not your appearance. There is so much more to you than that 💗

Remember, a bad body image MOMENT doesn't have to turn into a bad body image DAY. Acknowledge the way you're speaking to yourself, take a deep breath & consciously try to switch to more gentle thoughts!!

Please be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

Doc ID: 9512, distribution: 0.8802289962768555 ; i couldn't stop binge eating until i stopped pursuing weight loss. 

now read that again.

in our society, binge eating is often demonized and weight loss is often congratulated, so it made sense to me that in order to stop binge eating, the answer was to restrict, to try and “control” my binges, and to lose weight. i thought if i just had enough self control, the binge-restrict cycle would end.

what i didn't realize was that:

binge eating is often perpetuated by restriction,
the illusion of control actually made me more out of control,
and i couldn't simultaneously try to manipulate my body and heal my binge eating.

giving myself unconditional permission to eat, letting go of the idea of “perfect eating”, and ending the pursuit of a certain body were crucial steps (along with a lot of inner work) in my healing.

WEIGHT LOSS ≠ HEALTH, and a healthy unrestricted body will find its healthy weight, but what that looks like may not look how you wish it did.

you have to ask yourself,

what's more valuable to you? the ability to live life without a caveat and with the opportunity to pursue true health (if you want to)? or the pursuit of thinness?

i promise you that freedom, not just food freedom but LIFE freedom, is worth it.

something that i don't think i've shared or talked much about is that  years ago when i was in the depths of binge eating, i weighed  pounds more than i do now.  so yeah, i lost weight 😱, but it was a side effect of developing a healthier relationship to food and choosing to eat the foods that fuel and nourish my body and soul
——
what i AM against is diet culture, which equates thinness to health and moral virtue, demonizes certain food groups or ways of eating, praises people for their weight loss and vigilant eating patterns, and focuses on and values weight, shape, and size over actual health and well-being.  i'm against your mom telling you that to find a quality partner, you need to lose weight.  i'm against eating disorder treatment centers assigning restrictive diets to larger-bodied patients that only worsen their disordered eating and relationship to food.  i'm against kids being told that they shouldn't eat certain foods because they're “bad”.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

Doc ID: 12641, distribution: 0.8563632965087891 ; i hate diet culture soooo much it is painful: a rant :)
 
 So, recently one of my family members started a diet, and before (that means before my ed, during it, and after in the early stages of recovery) I was fine with the concept of a ✨diet✨, I saw nothing wrong with restrictions as a method to lose weight, obviously. But now that I have healthiest mentality I've had my whole life i can see the horrible, horrid, disgusting. body shamming, fat phobic, ed influence reality that diet culture and diets come with.

Diets are just glorified ed since must of them have the same rules, perspective, methods, recommendations, “facts” and i don't know what else that my ed voice told me, that i full-heartily believed, or that are common notions/advice that run in ed communities. 
“don't eat after certain hour” “stay away from this xxxxx because it has x amount of calories” “it's clean eating” “eat under xxxx amount of calories daily” “good food/bad foods” among other things and reasons that are just so ingrained in our culture that are fat phobic “i do this because i don't want to get fat” “I want to be pretty, I want to be skinny” “I just don't want to be fat” 

Also, i will go out on a wimp and say that all diets are unhealthy, to me they are. Nothing healthy, physically or mentally, comes from restriction. Nothing healthy comes from under eating. If your body is in a weight range that helps you, keeps you alive and makes YOU feel your best, i feel like that the thing we should stick to. What is health? How is health represented? But most importantly why does it have to be represented by a thin, white, cis body? Diet culture wants us to be the same template of a body and no ❤, i like my individuality and the “flaws” diet culture wants to correct are mine and part of my body ergo beautiful 

Anyway, I'm in the middle of class so i have to cut it here, but it will continue

i like roasting my veggies beforehand for this curry. i tossed the eggplant chunks, cauliflower florets, and butternut squash chunks in olive oil and sea salt and roasted at  for about  minutes. you can do this the day before or right before cooking, works either way! 
set the instant pot to sauté and add a generous amount of oil. add the onions and sauté for a minute before adding the curry paste. once softened, add the diced peppers and mix through, cooking for about two or three minutes. at this point add the remaining ingredients (if you dont roast the veggies before, just add them in raw here). stir until well-combined. set instant pot to pressure cook for  minutes. once done cooking leave the natural pressure release on for  minutes before venting. add spinach at the end and mix through to wilt before serving! .

 sorry. pet peeve is people who spread germs. stay the fuck home if you dont feel good or if any of your orifices are leaking. some of us have compromised immune systems/heavy workloads/busy schedules/no health insurance and cant afford to be sick. i go out of my way to avoid getting sick. and generally im pretty good at it. have gone years and years without catching a single bug. but leave it to a college campus, a cesspit of shit, to finally get me.  
 whats most upsetting is that i cant get any food today. i had my last can of soup way earlier, well… only half. rationing the other half for tomorrow. and i can tell that the lack of food is only making me feel worse. ive gotten progressively more sick as they day goes on. i spent most of the day in bed because even being upright in a chair was a bit exhausting. now i can barely move my body. my temperature is fluctuating wildly. i feel like i wasted my entire day. well. actually. i did. i still have to get my ass downstairs to water a few plants. im just so tired. i just wish i was smarter about the last few years of my life so i wouldnt be in this position. but alas. here i am. dealin with it.  
 i keep trying to tell myself that hunger is only a temporary feeling, and it comes in waves. but man, these waves almost have me on my ass. im so sick of fighting againsg nausea. worst feeling in the world. if my teeth werent fucked id be initiating my own vomit as to make myself feel better faster, and just get it out, but its futile.  theres nothing to even bring up.  
 chills. sweats. nausea. chills. sweats. nausea. just riding these waves. there goes my entire week. frustrated with a lot of things right now but ive done so much typing today that i just need to stop. elaborating isnt going to solve anything. i just need to get my plants taken care of and not pass the fuck out and ill be okay. cant wait for the day that im financially stable and can afford to have food in my house at all times. sick of having to sacrifice my own nutrition. i dont mind putting my animals first and feeding them first, that doesnt bother me. i will ALWAYS find a way to feed my animals and make sure they have their medicine until the bittetsweet end. but its disheartening not being able to eat because bills come first. if i keep going like this ill die and i wont be able to pay my bills or take care of my animals.  probably gonna go weigh myself on the way to the garden since the scale is down there. out of morbid curiosity. probably gonna be disappointed. always am. i can tell ive lost again. which is unsettling.  it sucks not being happy with your body no matter what you weigh.  lbs, im unhappy because i feel too skinny and weak and my brain functioning starts getting inhibited. doesnt feel good.  lbs, and im unhappy because i feel too squishy and slow. it takes a lot of fucking food to even get to that point, which makes me feel gluttonous n awful because i loathe the feeling of food digesting especially lots of it at once. i tell myself weight gain is what i want, and then ultimately it just doesnt feel right. and then everything else in between, i still feel unsettled in my own skin. ill tell myself i need to gain, and then i do, and i hate it. so ill lose, and ill hate that too. theres no winning. i wish proanas ( even the ones who dont realize they are ) would shut the fuck up and listen to what i have to say for once. i wish people understood that they dont actually want this. what you see on the surface of skinny, is not the reality behind skinny. literally i would give anything just to be a healthy weight and not have to agonize so hard over this. but the people who need to hear that, absolutely will not listen lmao.

Doc ID: 24566, distribution: 0.9413454532623291 ; Question: I've never felt this alone in my entire life.All my friends left for college and I'm still in this shithole.I'm more suicidal and self hating than ever before and everytime I try to tell them how I feel they use humor or try to brush it off. honestly I'm so  desperate for any form of affection or validation,even if it is just someone listening to my whining.I really miss them but they're too busy.Your blog makes me feel a bit better tho.Ur energy radiates positivity  Answer: :( im so familiar w/ this boat. after high school i slowly lost all my friends  by , lost most of them to bad drugs (and brain damage) but lost my absolute best friend to college (and a new set of friends). the older you get, i feel like the more egocentric people tend to get, and the less sympathetic “friends” tend to be. ppl just get increasingly more involved with themselves. to the point where they arent even capable of caring or thinkin abt anything but themselves. i talk to exactly  person from high school and she used to be a “best friend” but she only wants to talk to me when its about herself, now. she'll only hang out with me when she's “off again” with her “ex”boyfriend. whenever i talk about my feelings, she ignores me or finds a way to make it about herself. or laughs it off. i know this is a common theme for a lot of people and not just you and me. its also hard to get ppl to take you serious when they're uncomfortable with a topic. i wish people would grow the fuck up , so many people are so uncomfortable with discomfort - if that makes sense. you voice your pain/discomfort and ppl immeadiately shut down, ppl dont know what to say or do anymore so they just make jokes and they dont rly engage. eventually you give up trying to have a connection with them and then you  just end up lonely n desperate. you cant talk to any of your “friends” abt how lonely n isolated u feel bc theyll just hit u with the “bUt u hAvE mEeE” lmao. and then theyll stop replying  min later.. LOL. right. it sucks bc ur trying to decide whether you should hold shit against them or not. bc on one hand theyre neglecting the friendship, but on the other hand people get busy and its not fair to hold being too busy against them. u CAN hold being an absent friend against them tho. busy or not, ppl who care make time for one another. ppl who care make an effort to listen to how you're doing.. i miss my friends sometimes too, lol. havent talked to my childhood best friend in over a year now. but its for the best. i was patient with them n they all disappointed me. people grow apart naturally, if thats whats happening, try not to let it eat u alive. it means you're evolving, even if you're the one stuck at home. im sorry u feel so isolated right now. its not a fun way to feel. the best advice i can give is to focus on refining urself for the time being. keep urself busy becoming a better person. friends come and go and we all evolve/outgrow people but the next time a friend comes along, you could be the difference in their life. you could be the friend for that person that you've been needing all this time. you can be the empathetic ear that makes the time for them, and listens when they need you to. if you can do this for other ppl, it might make u feel a lil better.. and they might return the friendship. dont expect much, tho. ppl r fickle pickles. i try n befriend coworkers n stuff bc it makes me feel better. ppl like to be listened to so if i can just like listen to my coworkers and i mean RLY listen and offer support, they LOVE that and it makes ppl love u, yano. people dont always return the favors, you might not always have someone to go to, but at least you know you're giving everyone everything you can. you can be your own friend. theres knowledge and wisdom and power in silence. you just gotta get a bit more comfortable with it. being alone isnt the worst thing in the world, especially when you have a vivid interior to keep yourself amused. im glad my blog makes u feel a little better and i hope ur able to feel peaceful n calm this week, hang in there buddy

 i just texted him to not even bother today bc i want to spare myself the disappointment while im ahead. im turning my alarms off and im gonna lay down and shut my eyes and turn off my phone and try not to cry myself into asphyxiation like i always do. if i sleep now i can get like  hours before i have to get up and move about and tackle school.  
 ive barely been eating lately because im so overwhelmed and its so hard to prepare yourself nice food for not a lot of money when you live in the arctic tundra and ur stuck at a college all day with student facilities that are under construction and a broken ass car with no heat. i feel so stupid. i cant save money. i cant take care of myself. i cant maintain peace for more than  minutes. as soon as my animals die im not gonna have a fucking purpose anymore. im not even gonna be able to think straight or rest at all. i cant stop worrying and anticipating. times like this when u wish u had a mom or someone to tell u everythings gonna be ok. ive always sucked at comforting myself. my natural reflex to emotional pain is self destruction, not self soothing. i dont even know what to do. the oscillating catatonic panic attacks and the detached depersonalized episodes have been alternating so frequently that im even neglecting to go to the bathroom as often as i should. i almost pissed myself yesterday morning and i actually did piss myself today. i dont know why i try to fight my bodys cues. i dont know why i can take care of everyone and everything else but not myself.

However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track. Nobody gets it all right all the time. And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9429581165313721 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break.

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.938784658908844 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

I had just spoken with T about wondering whether my parents worried about me going off to university at a young age. I felt that T's response to that was quite invalidating. I can't remember now exactly what she said but something about not assigning blame and that my parents loved me. It seems like we have done all this work in therapy getting to an acceptance that my parents weren't perfect, yet now every time I allow myself to express a little spark of anger or even dissatisfaction or sadness over them and their actions, T jumps in and tries to smooth it all over. That just throws me right back to my old thought patterns that clearly my parents were great and it's me that's somehow wrong, that the critical part of me that's rolling her eyes and saying 'ffs Faith you make such a big deal out of nothing' is right. “It always feels like you're defending them” I said to T, in a resigned tone of voice. “Oh no, no I'm not defending them. I'm definitely not defending some of their decisions. I'm definitely not defending them pushing you ahead two years at school.” I shrugged at her. Her intentions and words don't seem to match up. She said “Maybe we need to talk some more next session about my views of their actions and their relationship with you” I nodded, and said a bit defeatedly “It feels like you're on their side” “I'm on your side, Faith. I'm definitely on your side.” We were nearly out of time and it felt like she was back-pedalling and trying to end on a reassuring note rather than a rupture. “I'm sorry if it feels like I'm not on your side. I really am. I think that's another thing that would be good to talk about next week… how does that feel?” I heard her saying that she was on my side. I'm glad she said it so many times because it did help it sink in and gave me something to hold on to. I still feel a bit let down by her though in the way that I brought some feelings to therapy and she shut them down without exploring what was going on for me. She seems so worried that she will damage my relationship with my parents that she won't hold space for me to say negative things about them. That makes it really hard for me to try and recalibrate my views of them, from them being perfect to a more realistic view that they did their best but they didn't get everything right.  “I know this is a really horrible place to end” - T emphasised the 'horrible' - “but we really are out of time now.” We had already gone ten minutes over to make up for the poor internet connection, which she'd offered earlier in the session, so I know that by the time we finished she did probably have to dash off to her next client or whatever. I just nodded in acceptance and we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. I noticed immediately afterwards that I hadn't said “thankyou” like I usually do at the end of a session. I guess I was still feeling her lack of attunement. There's a lot to process in next week's session.

Doc ID: 16855, distribution: 0.9352066516876221 ; Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says “Where to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about…. what we were talking about last week?” “I feel like I'm in a gap between those two things” “Ok, well…. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?” I nod. T flips a page in front of her. “You said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?” That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says “So you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?” “Uh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.” “Did you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?” “Noooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.” “Hmm and did you feel that I felt like that?” “Well nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.” We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? “No, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think… I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit… *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.” I hadn't “stopped eating”, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14454, distribution: 0.9345896244049072 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week's been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I'd been holding all week… and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right??

Doc ID: 16265, distribution: 0.9337326288223267 ; Therapy .. // Ending talk // part three  “I've read some people's accounts of ending therapy, and what it seems like is therapy is like a box - a good box! - where everything is available and you can talk about pretty much anything. But then you leave therapy and the box closes and you can't get back in.” “Like a turnstile? Where you can only go one way through it?” “Yes. And then maybe the therapist says you can email updates afterwards or whatever, and you do but then you just get a generic sort of email reply. And you can't talk about it because you're not in therapy anymore. You can't talk about what it's like being outside the box because you can't get back inside to do the talking.” “Mmm yes. So maybe it would be better to have a clean break?” Omg I'm panicking a bit now, I don't know what she's storing up for future from these things I say. We had  minutes left and T said did I want to talk about anything else? I said I had been thinking about my childhood… the things we were talking about at the end of last year… and how all the stuff we talked about wasn't new things that I hadn't remembered before. But I used to say my childhood was perfect because I figured that's how it looked from the outside. And if it all looked shiny and perfect, it must be so. And if I didn't fit into that story properly, it must be because there was something wrong with me. And now we've done all this work on that and all the stuff we talked about, and now I realise that it doesn't matter what it looked like from the outside. For me, how it felt for me and what my experience was, that's what's important for me. I tried to explain this to my friend the other day. It's the first time I'd ever tried to put it into words to say out loud. It came out in such a jumble, that even though my friend knows about a lot of my stuff, I'm not sure she entirely got what I was saying. But I decided that was ok because it's all very new ideas still and I'm trying to get it straight in my head and like a baby learning to talk, sometimes strings of words come out that haven't been properly processed, but the act of trying to say them helps to organise them for the next time. I did a much better job verbalising it to T (I guess partly because she knows what I am trying to say and has her therapy head on so she can reflect back to me and help me get it coherent) T encouraged me with how much progress I've made since I started seeing her. It makes me smile because I was a terrible therapy client to start with. I wouldn't look at her, I only spoke to her in one word answers while looking the opposite way out of the window with my hand hiding my face. I froze up all the time, couldn't deal with silences, couldn't think about how I was feeling….. I think she had to work really really hard to build up the relationship and enough trust that I could start to feel safe. She did it though. And I worked hard too. T asked me about people seeing how much progress I've made. That's really hard because so much of it is internalised. I was really good at keeping a front up a lot of the time, having learnt from childhood how to hide all my feelings. So nobody really knew the extent of how bad things were inside. T went through loads of people, H, my sister, my best friend, other friends…. I was like, hmm I don't know. She said, but you're so much more confident now. That's true - now my outside matches my inside. Whereas before I could act confident but inside I was a ball of stress and the cost of appearing confident would be that I would use a whole heap of unhealthy coping strategies to keep my feelings squashed down. We got to the end of the session and looked at each other. T said, I feel like I want to tell you that I'm really proud of you. I said Thankyou. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15175, distribution: 0.933534562587738 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15811, distribution: 0.9324911236763 ; Therapy .. // starting and ending  I really struggle with the start of therapy sessions - moving from that “everyday-life” mindset into the therapy space. And then I struggle again at the end to get back out of the therapy space. I only really registered that it's difficult both ways last session. I think my therapist thinks I am more aware of the time than I am. I often find I glance at the clock about halfway through the session, but then I get deeper into things and I don't look at it again. At the end of last week's session, I was talking about something deep, and then paused to think and then suddenly T was saying “so how about before we end, let's talk about something lighter… how about you tell me about what you've been up to with your family in lockdown”. I was a bit taken aback by the sudden transition from therapy material to surface stuff, and I struggled to find my way out of my head back into the world again. I often feel like I'm far away and the jump back into present time is too hard. I tried to wrestle myself back up to the surface, but in the end I just said to T, “I don't like it when you do that!” She took that on board and asked me how I would rather end things. “Would you rather just keep on talking about deep things right until the last moment?”  “Noooo…. it just feels like too much of a jump though. Too sudden.” I need her to wrap up what we're talking about a bit more, even if it's just saying that we'll carry on talking about it next week but we need to start bringing things to a close now. I know I am bad at ending on time. I never take responsibility for it. If T doesn't end the session, I just keep talking. I don't like the ending, having to leave and not see her for another week. She does have to gently push me out a little bit at the end. She usually does it by talking about scheduling for my next session, and at that point I will take it as my cue to end. But until she moves into that, I figure she's still willing to sit there and be with me so I just keep going. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16614, distribution: 0.931806206703186 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before.

Rest assured, it's just the final mini vlog from *this* travel series ok . . . I'll be back with my rucksack on in no time 😉 This is your final piece to the puzzle, because across both YouTube and Instagram I've pretty much vlogged every single day for this month trip (except when we were both ill 😴)!!
-
We left Koh Tao, where we did scuba diving with @lbdivingkohtao (episode  on YouTube), and travelled back to Bangkok. Now I panic booked this, because I was scared of prices suddenly inflating and thought this was the only route, but instead I'd recommend getting a ferry from Koh Tao to Chumphon and then a bus or internal flight to Bangkok. Going via Surat Thani, which I'd organised, was a very. long. route (look on a map 😅)!
-
Despite the long day of travelling though, I actually managed to try durian in Surat Thani 😱😳 Relative to other fruits in Thailand, wow this stuff is expensive 😂 But I had to give it a go, and my reaction is in today's vlog on YouTube (episode , live @ pm) 😏 I also tried sugar cane juice, which was unexpected, but I quite liked it! I thought it would be more refreshing than it was, but it literally tasted like sweets to me in a liquid form lol 😆

You'll recognise some (or most) of this from my vlogs and other posts, but this island is really special to me ✨ It had incredible vegan food, including the best burger I've ever eaten in my liiiiiife, deserted windy roads to explore on scooters and it's where I kicked some 🍑 trying Muay Thai (😏), but this was definitely the hardest time for Math and I because we both got pretty ill.

If you've got an urge to go backpacking, then I'd just say go for it because it truly has changed my whole perspective on life and we've only just started 🤩

In my budget video when that comes out (hopefully early next week) I also want to prove to you guys that travelling doesn't have to be expensive. I set myself a budget (ish) and we fell way within those limits! In fact, it turned out to be cheaper than expected and this was considered a very backpacker friendly budget according to my research 🙌🏻

I hope my Thailand Q&A was useful, but here are just some quick references based on what I've mentioned in this video:
-
🇹🇭 This smoothie bowl was from a vegan / veggie cafe on Koh Lanta called Happy Veggie 🥭
-
🇹🇭 We did our elephant tour with @chiangmaielephantland 🐘
-
🇹🇭 In Pai we had a scooter lesson and then hired them on Koh Lanta, which was super quiet and a perfect place to ride as beginners!
-
🇹🇭 I also had a private Muay Thai lesson on Koh Lanta, which was about £ for  hour!
-
🇹🇭 @matt.j.white is featured (😏) walking around the most iconic temple in Doi Suthep, Chiang Mai, called Wat Phra That.

So it's now coming up to a week since I left home and flew to the other side of the world. Saying that honestly sounds mental, but I literally am ... on the other side of the world! Phoning home has to be scheduled very precisely shall we say, but this is when I'm very grateful for what technology does for us, since it allows me to keep in contact the fam squad back at home.
-
I am still pretty homesick, jet lagged and overwhelmed, but I really am trying to embrace every moment and live fully in each experience, whether that be simply buying huge mangoes from the market or feeding kangaroos in a wildlife orphanage🙈 ... stay tuned for the vlogs guys!
-
I'm currently in Melbourne but I've got, what has to be, one insane trip around a lot of Australia. I've started the 'Holly Goes Solo' series on YouTube to document literally everything over the next  months, and I am so excited to show you what I get up to here: the highs and the lows, the best times and the worst. Travelling is not all fun, as it is sometimes portrayed to be online, so I'm coming at you with the usual Holly strangeness and realness. %.

There's a new video coming today at pm GMT and they'll be a IG spam coming soon too 🇦🇺🌞

One week into this trip and I'm having the best time 🤩 Travelling does not always go to plan and there are definitely low lights . . . but that's why I call it an adventure, right!?! As we speak I almost locked myself out my room (lol 😅), and that's why I honestly love making my travel videos to show you the *bigger* picture 👏🏻
-
I hope you enjoyed episode , my first impressions of Germany, to find out what it's *really* like here in the country 😏🙈 Oh, and you always, always, have permission to lol at my attempts at speaking German 😅
-
As it's also Monday, your motivation for the week is to simply try and do more of what makes you happy 😌 To 'follow your dreams' is a biiiiiig big statement to make, but at the very least it is a reminder to work towards making your goals a reality ✨

DONT GET FOOLED BY POSTS LIKE THIS.  
 - “ im worried about how skinny you got” -  discusted stares - size  too big, size -yr fit length but not waist, size -yr too short. - you wouldnt want to sit on their lap because you feel the heaviest - sick in everything. Pale, back under the eyes, damaged hair - you dont want to step in dressing rooms  - you will never be comfortable to go out in a bikini - dainty wrists/ hip bones/ collarbones that will ALWAYS be bruised - “how did you do it?” Its the most awkward and uncomfortable question ever - the lower you get the less confident you get.  
 Its an illness not a game! And unfortunately once you start you cant stop. You are never satisfied - ever! So please dont get lured by such pro posts!  

 rb for @save-pantelina's comment. “do it for the..” lists are ignorant and vapid. proanas dont realize that once you're sick, you wont come near a dressing room. i havent been to a mall in years. the life OP is romanticizing is a life of pain and isolation. dont think things will get better the deeper you let yourself go, your problems just become infinitely more complex.

 People be out here thinking the image and attitudes of women in popular music are an attempt at sex appeal to men when really its about manipulating the behaviour of women. 
 Convincing as many women as possible that they're a boss ass bitch who only needs men for sex, gradually turning them into atomised neurotics chasing impossible standards while filling the void in their lives with rampant consumption is actually a great marketing strategy.

 I don't want to be the biggest sibling and the biggest friend.  

 'you got skinny!' is tactless as fuck. people. shouldn't. say that. 'I can fit my hand all the way around your waist' um if you're that thin you're seriously SERIOUSLY ill. like your muscles are wasted away you probably can't even stand. also who the fuck would just grab your waist like that. Jealous stares - no. concerned stares. are they ok stares. what happened to that poor girl/boy stares. size XXS and size  - clothing sizes are always changing and these sizes are often based on models who starve themselves throw up and are airbrushed to hell and back. 'you can sit on my lap' again what the fuck. why do so many of these read like some pedo is saying them. nobody says that. nobody has ever casually told me 'oh yeah hey sit on my lap'. that just isn't a thing people do unless it's your best friend or significant other, in which case you can be any damn size, they still think you're stunning and love you. beautiful in anything: on a practical level no, everyone has their own individual style and look and colours that complement them which has nothing to do with weight. also if you're extremely skinny yes maybe you have that ethereal elfin thing and yes we're conditioned to believe skinny is beautiful because society is garbage (and there's nothing wrong with being skinny of course you're beautiful regardless) but anorexic thin - you might feel beautiful but sweetheart you're ill. you're dangerously ill. you need help. please get help. 'you're so light/I'll give you a piggyback ride' again weird weird creepy weird do you people not get it these are not things people say to you in normal life it doesn't matter what size you are this really is not a conversation that people have. confidence in dressing rooms: dressing rooms are horrible environments clothing sizes are constantly changing the lighting is terrible if you're not feeling confident you're no different from % of people you're not ugly I swear. also if you're ill you won't feel confident. anorexia is an illness. bikini body: I can't even begin to describe how much I hate this. One: if you're this skinny you'll probably be very sensitive to sunlight you shouldn't expose yourself. Two: literally nobody on the beach cares, unless they're an actual asshole from hell. Three: bikinis are a ridiculous concept anyway which allow women to body shame each other. wrists/collarbones/slender legs/thigh gaps: all symptomatic of SERIOUS DANGEROUS weight loss. also bruising constantly, never being able to get comfy. this is a look which suggests illness and pain and desperation. it is not a goal (side note if you are slender naturally and have some of these features I'm not shitting on you - if this is your body type and you are healthy it's FINE) 'You look like a model!' refer to my earlier point about models being anorexic often and airbrushed etc. 'how did you do it?' you became ill. plain and simple. it's not discipline or health or goals, it. is. illness. ability to feel confident in your own skin - fuck off. fuck right off there. just get out. confidence comes from so many things. the love of your family, a beloved pet, your friends, your skills, the knowledge that you have a beautiful smile, that you are intelligent, kind, funny, gentle, accomplished. not this. not a terrible, tragic illness that should NEVER be romanticised ever because it is so unbelievably toxic. not from a thinspo blog caught in the vicious circle of illness unhappiness and expressing that through encouraging others down the same path. never. NEVER. tl;dr these blogs and post are written by people with a serious illness trying to trap others in the same illness. it's not their fault, they might not mean any harm but they are ill. not goals. ill. As someone who has narrowly avoided going down this path several times, I can't even begin to describe how harmful and toxic this kind of thing is. I'm sorry you're ill, I'm sorry you're going through this but please for the love of god. Stop trying to spread it to other people.

 It is now mid-October, the air is crisp and fresh with the smell of fallen leaves and rain. Leaves in varying hues of amber, golden yellow, scarlet, and warm orange are collected in clusters along the sidewalks and curbs. Amidst the rain and wind, they tumble gracefully from the trees in solo dances. The city's energy is different, as it always is in the fall.  
 You sit in your favourite mocha leather armchair in the corner of the coffee shop a few blocks from your apartment. As you watch the crowds of people with umbrellas and raincoats rush by through the glass, you sip an aromatic latte, warm with the smell of pumpkin and spices. Your long, thin legs are crossed in front of you, easily fitting on the chair. Your delicate frame is kept warm by a soft, oversized sweater that falls off of your shoulder, accentuating your protruding collarbones and poised neck. Your beautiful long hair is tied up in a bun and you wear glasses that frame your eyes, which now look bigger and more innocent on your beautifully defined face. 
 Reaching over to pick up your book from the table next to you, you catch the eyes of a cute boy, a year or so older than you. He is tall, muscular, has soft brown hair and warm olive skin. You can't help but smile, looking down out of shyness, then back at him. He turns away to order his coffee, and you go back to opening your book. About a page in, the boy comes up to you and makes a comment about the book that you are reading. Soon enough, you are deep in conversation with him and feel completely comfortable.  
 You are no longer self conscious about a swollen belly or thick legs. You now have a perfectly visible thigh gap while wearing black leggings, and your arms are delicate and small. Instead of looking fat and dorky in a big sweater, you look cute and cozy. The boy obviously notices that you are cute, and when he asks for your number, you can't help but think that all of that work and pushing was worth it. Skipping meals, constricting calories, working out consistently, lying to people about eating, and fighting binges; All of the pain has finally paid off and you have been rewarded for your efforts. 
 Back to school, apple picking, pumpkin patches, bonfires, halloween costumes & parties, cuddling to keep warm at football games. You want to be thin enough to enjoy all of these things when they come.  
 Keep pushing, stay safe, remain strong. It will all be worth it in the end.

 take up space.
in a world that tells you to shrink
asks you to be smaller and quieter and lessen your voracious appetite for life
in a world that tells you to swallow your words and turn away from food
and teach your heart to whisper its beats,
take up space
fearlessly
fiercely
ferociously
take / up / space
be unapologetic in your greed for life
you do not have to be light and thin and ethereal delicacy
disappearing into a ghost of a girl
I want you to be substance and weight and presence
and when you feel your voice pressing against your throat
desperate to get out the words that lay at the center of your soul
in a world that demands your silence
I want you to yell at the top of your lungs
letting loose the storm that swirls inside of you
you were not meant to deny the pull of lifelifelife pulsing through your veins
you were not meant to exist on a steady diet of “I'm sorry”
apologizing for the very air you breathe
you were meant to stand proudly
walking as though you command the room
speaking as though your words drip diamonds
because my god
we need you
we need your voice, your mind, your raging, passionate heart
and when this world asks you to be less
I want you to yell back as loudly as you can

Hey guys! So I'm back with another full day of eating because you enjoyed the last one 😉 As you know, I'm training for the London marathon and this was filmed on a long run day 🏃🏻‍♀️ I usually eat quite a bit (🙃😏), but training often blows my appetite through the roof!!! Food is FUEL remember, so listen to your body and eat what makes you feel good 💚🙌🏻
-
Breakfast : Soaked oats with soy milk, sultanas and maple syrup as my pre-run fuel 💪🏻Oats sit well in my stomach but I may start experimenting with other foods before I run!
-
Breakfast : Honeydew melon, coconut water (amazing for replenishing electrolytes) and a classic Holly smoothie, blueberry edition 💜 I added bananas, frozen blueberries, frozen mango and pineapple, soy milk, water to blend, flaxseed powder, hemp seeds and salted caramel protein powder. All the powders and stuff I use are from @myvegan (use HOLLY for % off #affiliate) 🤓 I also had a hot lemon and a bowl of fruit with PB 😏
-
LUNCH: I made these savoury oat wrap things (I'll share the recipe soon 😉) filled with houmous, lots of salad veggies and obvs topped with hemp seeds! I always have to eat something sweet either straight away or a bit later, so I made a yoghurt bowl with @alpro vanilla yoghurt, an apple, oats, cacao nibs and a cheaper version of Biscoff spread 😅🤫
-
DINNER: Brown rice bowl with leftover brown rice, edamame and veggies all mixed with a tahini-balsamic vinegar thing (I call everything a thing lol 😅). Oh plus more hemp seeds and pickles (bae 🥰)!!!

🧁  sachet of the @macrmike x @breeelenehan double choc mug cake (code: AMB-BREE + they're % off until :pm Thursday / tomorrow night)
🧁 -mls of nut/oat milk (I personally use oat milk)
🧁  tsp of crunchy Biscoff spread
🧁  heaped tsp of YoPro vanilla yoghurt

Method:
Mix the mug cake sachet with mylk & then scoop out a spoonful of cake mix from the centre, add a scoop of Biscoff spread to the hole you've made, then cover it with the cake mix you spooned out before. Pop in the microwave for - seconds, then add your toppings & enjoy!! 

For so long I believed that in order for me to live a “healthy lifestyle”, I had to cut chocolate & sweets out all together.. But that's not the case. It's not all-or-nothing… Balance is key! For me, as long as I'm also eating nutrient-packed foods like fruit, veg, grains, getting enough protein, carbs & fats to give my body energy… there's absolutely room for those less nutrient-dense foods too.

BUT the reason I created this mug cake range with @macrmike is because I really wanted there to be some tasty, vegan, gluten free, macro balanced, high protein & nutrient-dense sweets / snacks / dessert options too = my mug cake range is ✨ the best of both worlds ✨ & available in  flavours!

Doc ID: 15243, distribution: 0.9388160705566406 ; It's been a bit of a busy day today. GCSE results this morning (they're the national UK exams at age ). No more ridiculous algorithm for these results, they are back to using teacher assessed grades for the exams they never sat. d was very happy with her results, she can't quite believe they're as good as they are. She is not such a hard worker as d, although she has many other good qualities, but I like to think she would have pulled it out of the bag when it counted so she deserves these grades. This afternoon my bff came round for a catch up, which was lovely.  Then I went to meet an old school friend who was up for a couple of days. She has two children who are wheelchair users, so I was trying to find somewhere to go for tea where they would all be comfortable. I also had the baby in a pram, so we were quite a procession. Thankfully the venue I had chosen worked perfectly but I felt a lot of responsibility in picking the right place. Her children love the baby, so it was all a bit mad but we managed to have some sort of conversation over the heads of all the excitement and screeching (baby's new skill). After tea, I left them and went home, left the baby in the care of H and went out for a socially distanced team drink with the other baby and toddler group leaders from church. That was a much needed glass (or two) of wine. Now I'm home and packed because we are leaving for Cornwall at am 😱 trying to beat the traffic. One child is still out partying, H has just picked up another child and third child made her own way home. I hope they are packed and ready by am, whether they've slept or not!! I'm off to bed now for a few hours sleep if I can.

Doc ID: 17229, distribution: 0.9321714639663696 ; Melllllting   Oh my goodness what a hot day it's been! H got up at .am as he had to go to London for work. The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

Doc ID: 17206, distribution: 0.9253839254379272 ; Ahhh babies 👶👶 💕💕  We had a mad morning.  Baby  had a hospital appt at . so baby  had to go to a friend. In order to get both babies up, fed, changed, dressed, fed again, bags packed up and baby  dropped off with friend in time for me to get to the hospital with baby , I had to start the day at .am.  Thankfully we made it all on schedule. Two babies is physically exhausting compared to one (obvious I suppose but it's easy to discount the double exertion involved.) It's like running a km but using all the energy of a km. Two babies and an oxygen cylinder (it is NOT “lighter than air” - it is actually very heavy!) in and out of car seats, in and out of the house, in and out of the car…. We all made it home for .am, just in time for me to eat breakfast (👍) then take d to her friend's house to head off to Greece for two weeks, lucky girl! Got home from THAT about midday ahhhhh It's been a quieter afternoon inside but thunderbolts and lightening outside. Thumping rain. It's .pm now and I'm counting down the hours to baby bedtime. Although last night, baby bedtime was an extended period that went on till .pm ugh 😴 so hoping for nearer pm tonight. I am escaping for a swim and a relax in the spa at .pm, whether they're asleep or not. H can take over at that point!

Doc ID: 17171, distribution: 0.9235976338386536 ; rd August  I think I've hit a bit of a wall! My get up and go has got up and gone. But I carry on, just rather wearily, like ploughing through treacle. I did the parkrun this morning while H had the babies and took the car to get a new tyre. The tyre took longer than expected but he did eventually manage to meet me after the parkrun and we went for a coffee in the same outdoor cafe as yesterday. Parkrun was a slow one. I knew I didn't have the energy to push myself so I just took it steady but even so my legs were running on empty. I think I am probably exerting more calories than I'm taking in, even though I'm stubbornly pushing myself to eat three meals a day and mostly succeeding. I think I should eat more but my rigid brain doesn't want to bend that way. This afternoon we have hung out at home, taking it in turns to entertain the babies and do jobs. I managed a nice period of one-handed jigsaw doing (I was bouncing baby  in the bouncy chair with the other hand) outside in the warm weather, so that was good. A little bit of (almost) me-time. H and I also took it in turns to each have a short nap on the sofa. Now it's the evening. We might get a Chinese takeaway later but H and the girls are out, and I am home with two sleeping babies, so I'm waiting for the others to get back. I'm sitting with the remaining mess of the day around me, and ignoring it while I drink a glass of white wine and try and catch up with the babies' daily diaries. I'm supposed to write in them every day but I'm pretty rubbish at remembering and always end up writing a few days at a time. I really hate to admit it, but I think two babies for three weeks may be my limit. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16090, distribution: 0.9233157634735107 ; Thurs  Feb  The last thing H said to me this morning before he went to work was “Why don't you just have a restful day today.” It seemed quite possible at am this morning, with the whole day stretching ahead of me.  I got a text from d in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said “Can you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.” Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an  minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn't pass 😭. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn't a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I'd ordered wasn't there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn't ordered was there. So we made a profit of  packs of brioche,  packs of krispie cakes,  bags of crisps and  eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I'd sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d's medical needs, I was rather hoping my pm tutee would cancel, but she didn't. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D's bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I'm finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week's episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice. I'm nibbling on dark chocolate and raspberry coated almonds which I bulk ordered online as a nutrition dense snack to help push my intake up after my long runs.  Tomorrow I am hoping for a proper restful day. All my children may make it out of the house (d has improved as the day has gone on and hopes to make it back to school tomorrow) and I may even get chance to paint the bannisters!

Doc ID: 15729, distribution: 0.9224027395248413 ; Question: How old are the kids you foster? How many kids do you foster? Answer: We foster babies. They're generally newborn, just a few days old, when they come to us. We only foster one baby at a time. They usually stay with us between  months and a year. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15854, distribution: 0.9223574995994568 ; An unexpected consequence of these lockdown times is that that baby gets loads more holding and cuddling. No one is going anywhere, so with the baby there's no groups to go to, no car rides, no teenager activities to try and fit around, no evening activities to go out to that I need to try and get the baby asleep before I go. So the baby leads a lovely life that is just a constant round of feeding, snuggling and sleeping. When she wakes early from a nap, she gets more snuggling till she goes back to sleep again. It's nice. Maybe this is what it used to be like for babies back in simpler times. When busy lives didn't have so many demands on our time.  The first couple of weeks after lockdown occurred, I said to friends “this is a rubbish time to be a baby!” - mainly because I couldn't buy nappies, I couldn't buy formula milk, and no health or social care professionals wanted to come and visit us. But now I think “this is the best time to be a baby!” - just nesting and nurturing. Who'd have thought it. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15020, distribution: 0.917773425579071 ; Question: Who is H? How many babies have you fostered? Could you ever adopt any of them? Answer: H is my husband (H for husband!) We've fostered  babies and no we haven't ever had the option to adopt any of them. Fostering babies in the UK doesn't generally lead into adoption by the fostering family. The usual outcome is either reunification with birth family or adoption by adopters who are already assessed and waiting.

Doc ID: 15968, distribution: 0.9169606566429138 ; Lockdown Day   These lockdown days seem to get so full up of stuff that I barely have time to get on tumblr, which is sad because it makes me feel disconnected from all my tumblr friends. Eating has been somewhat better today, although after doing PE with Joe (and d, d and d), I went for a run (my one allowed daily outing for exercise). It was the penultimate run of my half marathon training schedule, a tempo run with  minutes warm up jog then  minutes at fast pace and  minutes cool down jog. My legs were dead, I don't think Joe's PE was a good pre-run idea. For the first time ever in the entire training schedule I skipped the optional extra part of the run, so I only did  minutes fast. Then walked home for the cool down. I didn't eat enough yesterday and I exercised too energetically this morning and it came back to bite me at pm when I crashed out on the sofa. So none of that was great.  On the positive side, the weather was so sunny and warm today, I started to wonder if I should have worn suncream for my run. It's been beautiful and we've been sitting out in the garden enjoying it. I want to write about therapy - last week and this week. I'm hoping I'll have time to do that tomorrow. I am in need of a peaceful day just pottering around rather than frantically trying to do jobs and take phone calls in between the baby's schedule and trying to keep on top of everything as much as I can for the girls. In other news, we got Disney+ yesterday and everyone is very happy. I'm not really bothered about watching it (no time haha) but I'm happy that everyone else is happy. Since the gym is shut, we get a rebate of our gym membership which will more than cover the Disney+ cost so that was our justification. Plus we need things to do in these lockdown times. Of course our daily appointment with Boris at pm. He wanted to be remembered for Getting Brexit Done, and instead he'll be remembered for Getting Us Through The Coronavirus Pandemic. I don't like him and his party and policies but I do think he's doing a pretty good job overall of this. And Chris Whitty and the other guy (Prof someone) will be up for knighthoods when this is all over I'm sure. This evening we had a Zoom with our church group and that was lovely to see everyone and give thanks for the good things in our lives and pray for each other's needs. Very encouraging. I'm heading for bed very soon now so I'll say goodnight. Stay safe and healthy everyone if you can x

Doc ID: 16034, distribution: 0.9155011773109436 ; Question: why does baby get contact with mom if shes in foster care? is it only for babies or for older foster kids too?  Answer: All children have the right to a family life through the Human Rights Act. This means even if they are brought into foster care, they have the legal right to continue to have a relationship with their birth family unless or until there is good reason to stop this. This applies to all children of all ages. When children have arranged contact with their birth family, this right to family life is protected (even though arranged contact may not be what everyone views as 'family life').Baby will continue to have supervised contact with her birth mum until a ruling is made by the court abut her future. Imagine if there was no contact, and then the court found six months later (the standard minimum length of family court proceedings in the UK) that mum was able to safely parent her baby. By then mum and baby wouldn't have seen each other for  months and the relationship would have been severely damaged. Contact can also form a very useful part of the parenting assessment, which contributes to the court's final decision.Newborn babies typically have relatively large amounts of contact with their birth parents -  hours, three or four times a week. This helps preserve their relationship in the critical early months of life until a court ruling has been made. Older children in care of the local authority have varying amounts of contact depending on the circumstances, but very rarely as frequent as newborns.
