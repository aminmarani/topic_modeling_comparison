The hormones in a woman's body cause us to store fat in places we're taught to feel ashamed of… 😮‍💨⤵️

Our thighs, legs, stomachs, arms, cheeks, hips, etc

None of those things are actually bad, they're just part of being ✨ human ✨ 

This isn't ONLY directed at female bodies… ALL bodies are different 💫

Accepting & even “romanticising” that has helped me see the divinity in all of these squishy, dimply, wrinkly, magical parts of me.

I hope it helps you start seeing yourself through a gentler lens too🪞❤️‍🩹

Which one of these  is your fav? Lmk in the comments, I'll be replying to them all! 💛 Anyway, happy Monday my friends, I give you full permission to walk into this week with confidence & loving self-thoughts! 😏 I hope your week is just as AMAZING as you are! 🧚🏻‍♀️

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

Wearing @baseline's new Seamless collection 😍 absolutely adore these pieces & the gorgeous ribbed fabric!! You can get % off too with the code BREE - orders over $ get free shipping! 🥳

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human — there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

Btw how cute is this set from @boandtee?! It's from their new Eclipse collection & I've been living in it 😍 [ad]

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. A healthy & fit body looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

This is what activewear ACTUALLY looks like on the human body & what you'd see if you bumped into me at the gym. It moves and rolls and squishes and folds over. It has lumps and bumps and is soft. It works hard for me, allows me to get active, lift things and challenge myself!! I'm so grateful for it 👏🏻

In my books, you're already a healthy & fit babe the moment you start making healthier decisions both physically & mentally! So rock that cute activewear set you've been too scared to wear! 🥳

I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL body! You can't hate yourself into a body you'll love. Trust me, I know 💛

Happy Real Me Monday 🦋 have the best week xo

Doc ID: 2374, distribution: 0.8475911069267604 ; The reality of wearing a tight bodycon dress (& being human) 🤷🏻‍♀️

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

🌟 Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
🌟 Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
🌟 LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world 🥹 I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same… Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
🌟 Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
🌟 Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you… 
🌟 If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key 🥰
🌟 At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us 💅 It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible 🫶

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks 💗

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2392, distribution: 0.8444799403591521 ; You will never ✨actually✨ see your own body. You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

- diced red onion 
- chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- vegan feta cheese 
- chopped arugula 

toss everything together and then add in the vegan basil pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

-  apples of choice, diced (i used envy apples)
-  can of chickpeas (oz), rinsed and drained
- / cup vegan feta cheese

maple djion vinaigrette:

-  tbsp dijon mustard
- - tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup      
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the vinaigrette over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

i poked and grabbed. i wasn't satisfied with the shape of x, or the softness of y. my mind instantly painted the situation as problem/solution.

what i mean by this is that i looked at these body parts as they were, and i told myself that there was a problem; a problem that was causing them to look this way. this is a narrative deeply ingrained in my being. i am aware of it. i am conscious of it. it is a whisper that i have virtually muted, and when it slips through the cracks, i am able to catch it.

but that doesn't mean it's not there.

you see, the words we use to speak to ourselves can alter the course of our lives. by analyzing a body part and thinking, “the problem is…”, i'm telling myself that ) this body part isn't SUPPOSED to look this way, and ) it is my fault, that i am to BLAME for not having executed the solution.

in the past i've let this language win. and when it wins, it ends in misery. it ends in self-torture, bending over backwards to desperately alter the body that stands before me in the mirror. that “solution” i'm looking for? it doesn't exist. nothing will ever be % satisfactory.

the narrative i've shifted to instead falls along the lines of “this is how i was built”, “this is the body that was intended to carry me all along”. this narrative does not have hints of failure or blame on my behalf. it harbors acceptance for what is and what is meant to be. it is hard work. this is not always my default mindset. but it's the one i work diligently to calling on each day. 
this is not discourage pursuits to change our bodies or efforts to grow stronger and more confident. it's just a reminder to be mindful of our intentions and the way we speak to ourselves, always ♥️

maybe you've struggled with saying “yes” to things that you should have said “no” to in anticipation of  of how the other person would react…

but here's what can happen when we do this:

✖︎we don't have time for our own personal affairs

✖︎we don't show up % for that project/event

✖︎we take the opportunity from someone else who may have LOVED to do it

✖︎we become less connected with our intuition, our bodies, and our inner caretaker

✨what about when you say “not right now, but i appreciate the thought?” ✨

some things that might happen: 

❀you show up for yourself by holding those boundaries

❀you strengthen your relationship with your intuition & body

❀you prove to yourself that you can take care of your physical and emotional needs

❀you give the opportunity to someone else who might love it more than you

❀others either respect you more, or learn about what you can and can't do at that time

❀you release the responsibility of someone else's emotions (whew! that's a big one!)

When on the self ____ journey, sometimes your “no” can be one of the most loving things you can offer. if you resonate with this, you know that it does take some work & self reflection for it to be your normal.

it's okay that you don't know who you are yet, this isn't your forever, and one day, you'll be able to genuinely say that you feel confident, at peace, hopeful, and free.

i'm proud of you. keep fighting.

love,
 year old me who is feeling confident, at peace, hopeful, and free

i have my share of day to day struggles, and managing chronic depression and migraines is something that is still part of my current reality, but the difference between how my struggles affect me now vs. in the past is that my struggles no longer define or control me. when hard times happen, they're easier to deal with, and when good times come, they're more fully enjoyed.

it's moments like these, when i put down the heaviness to embrace the present, go out in the world, and do something joyful, that remind me of how far i've come and that there is always hope to hold onto.

shoutout to everyone healing from things others don't know about, making progress that no one recognizes, and fighting battles others may not understand.

i see you. I'm proud of you. keep going.

my inner critic voice is loud today, but rather than letting it dictate my life and influence my actions, i'm choosing a new narrative to tell myself instead. gentle reminder that we are our biggest influence, and the way we speak to ourselves matters!

here are some affirmations that are working for me today and may be resonating with you too:

i am greater than the narrative my anxiety is creating in my head.

i matter, and i deserve to live a life of peace, joy, fulfillment, and love. i will let go of and separate myself from the things getting in the way of the life i deserve.

i am in control of how i show up, what i focus on, and how i respond.

i am enough. who i am is enough. what i do is enough. working on accepting and loving myself fully and unconditionally is how i take my power back.

——
one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.
——
we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

This session I looked around the room blankly and eventually pulled a helpless face at T, and she just raised her eyebrows back at me and smiled in a kind of carefully equally-helpless “yes, this is a dilemma isn't it?” I sighed and looked at my short page of notes and said “I'm trying to decide what order to say things in”. This is just a variation on things I say to try and get started. “Hmm ok. Well, you could start with the most difficult to get it out of the way, or you could build up to it and do it last but we might run out of time…” This is also just a variation on things T says in response to me trying to get started. I wish I could be someone who just sits down and start splurging their innermost thoughts. I seem to need  or  minutes for the emotional pressure to build up enough to get me speaking. I don't know whether there's any way to bypass this. I might bring it up next session. If nothing else, it will be a different way to start 🤷‍♀️

(There isn't much heroic about her imho but I get it's just what you call it) Then she said that the story feels unfinished and she wants to know what happened next…but no rush to write the next instalment. (There isn't another instalment) I guess we'll talk about it next therapy session. I think last session when T said what she said, it made little Faith think that T is on her side and be finally able to trust T enough to speak up. I don't know but that's what it feels like. When I read the story, I think yep that sounds pretty messed up. Yet if I try and think about the story in context of me, I think ehhh it was just how it was. Reading in black and white the facts as I remember them, I can see loads of reasons why I might have developed an eating disorder (or indeed any other coping strategy for anxiety)

How did you know it was a good fit with your current therapist Answer: I had no idea about therapists being a good fit when I started therapy tbh. I didn't know it was a Thing. I'd never seen a therapist before and I knew nothing about therapy and was terrified about the whole process. I was only there because my friends dragged me there. It didn't even cross my mind that there might be options of other therapists. As far as I was concerned, it was this therapist or die trying.Having said that, now I know more! It's very understandable to be apprehensive and scared before meeting a new therapist. It takes time to feel comfortable with someone, so don't be disappointed if you don't “feel it” straight away. Give it a few sessions and try and keep an open mind. Think about what you want from therapy and whether you feel you can work on that with this therapist. I hope your first meeting goes well!

Doc ID: 15999, distribution: 0.9778303638666734 ; Therapy .. // how did we get here?  “Where to today then?” I could complain that T always starts like this and it feels like asking me to jump right in a bit too abruptly. However, she used to start with “How are you?” and that always made me freeze up, so I have to concede this is preferable. There's always an awkward pause after T asks this question, while I psych my brain and mouth up to cooperate. “Sooo, I had a list last week and I know said that it connected into the previous week's list…. but then we talked about the first two things on it and never got on to the bit that connected….” “Ah ok, and how many things do you have on your list today?” I laughed and shook my head and told her I don't have a list this week, it's been too mad and I'm too tired to even think about a list. “Ok so do you want to talk about the thing you didn't get on to last week?” “Yeah…. so… uh I just wanted to check in that… uh… so I had this list we were talking about… and it kind of came from stuff we were talking about maybe  weeks ago… and I guess I wanted to check that…. you know how we got here?” T paused and looked confused for a moment, and then said “hmm… I'm not quite sure what you're asking me?” She thought a moment and said “My recollection of where we got to was that last week we were talking about regulation. We talked about our relationship being sort of like a mother and daughter. But with conditions. I don't want you to feel trapped in it, like with d about to go off to university, you have given her that emotional regulation and now she's grown up and will find new attachment figures and she can do that because you've given her enough regulation for her to be able to do that. She's almost ahead of you…. when you were a child you didn't get enough emotional regulation and so you're still working it out now, how to do it.  Like with eating, you had to learn how to regulate and respond to your physical needs, and you've pretty much got that now. Now you're learning to do a similar thing with your emotions…. That's my recollection of where we got to. Does that fit with what you were thinking?” I think for a therapist, T talks quite a lot. I have used and abused it a bit over the years. Sometimes I know she'll answer her own question if I keep quiet long enough, but sometimes she talks too much for me to process all of what she says and it just throws me into shutdown. In answer to her question now though, I said “Er, no.” T smiled. “Ok, well that's ok, it's ok for us both to see things from different angles.” “Yeah… I do agree with what you said. It just wasnt quite what I was thinking about.” T waited. “Go on! take the plunge”, she encouraged. It's annoying because I've got it all written out, so I don't know why I'm struggling for words. They're all there on the paper in front of me. I eventually managed to read out that I meant the chain of conversations that had gone from six weeks ago when we looked at the first of two screenshots from books about attachment, and about feeling subtly trapped by the people I'm closest to. And how we went from there to talking about me and H, and then T asked me how I would like our relationship to look like and that's when I wrote the list. But then we had that week off when I was away, and then that first week back it felt like she'd forgotten what we were talking about. Up to then I felt like we knew where we were going and then that last week before the break, it was quite a difficult session and then we had the break and then it just seemed like you didn't remember where we were going with it all. So I just want to feel like you've picked it up again. T replied, “Yes ok, so therapists are just people like everyone. I've had some really difficult stuff going on in my life -“  (don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is don't tell me what it is)  “- which you may have picked up on because I may have not been as quite on the ball. It's ok for us to “miss” each other sometimes, because that's what happens in relationships. It's life. We have to learn to miss each other and then get back on track.

And it's ok for you to tell me if you think I'm losing track, that's ok, that's your responsibility to do that.”  Ummm I know it's my responsibility, that's why I'm doing it now?? Anyway, I said “Uh uh. But I'm not mad. I just want to know that you know where we're up to. Because that session before the break, we talked about me and H, and it was quite difficult…. and I don't really want to have to say all that again.”

Doc ID: 15350, distribution: 0.9760008952417593 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16905, distribution: 0.9755624180539556 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16144, distribution: 0.975105449778744 ; Question: I was wondering if you do think I am really lucky with T that we have just been a great fit for each other and the way she does therapy really worked for me. It took me a long long time to build up trust with her (now I see that was transference and I was just very scared of her responding to me the way important people have in the past) but she must have learnt a lot about me through that period. I think it really depends how your therapist works, but one useful tip I learnt in therapy is if I get stuck, to talk about the process. So I say, “I have a list of things here but they're too hard to start talking about”. Or “I have thoughts in my head but I can't put them into words” etc. Then T knows what I'm thinking (remembering she's not a mind-reader!) and she can help me move forward.I'm happy for you to private message me but apologies in advance if I don't always reply very speedily 😊 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15026, distribution: 0.9747906434816207 ; We were talking about some really deep childhood stuff this week in therapy, and near the end of the session T reflected that and said that we just have a few minutes left. I said “I think I need to talk about something else now” which T thankfully correctly understood as meaning I need to put these thoughts away so I'm not left with it all open when this session ends. T asked what I would like to talk about and I was a bit floored due to most of my brain still being stuck in childhood mode. “Shall I ask you some questions then?” she said, and I nodded. She carried on “Hmm… ok… children… holidays… the baby… what shall we go with?… oh the baby, tell me about the baby. I've hardly seen this baby because H has been around to look after her during your sessions! Usually I get a glimpse or two here and there…. So, what's happening with her future?” I started telling T about the plans for the baby's future and it quickly brought me back into the present time and space. We ran over time by  minutes, but it was very effective for me. It closed down what we were talking about so well that I've had a hard time re-accessing it since! Usually I go back and mull over what we've talked about, but this week I don't seem to have been able to do that. Maybe it's a good thing, it would have been hard being stuck in those childhood feelings all week. I think I will still try and write a post or two about the session but there might not be too much detail of some bits.
