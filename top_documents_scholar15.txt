Doc ID: 7209, distribution: 0.961758553981781 ; i've been sitting on this recipe for weeks- i'm sorry in advance 😣 the heartiest, most nourishing stew, brought together by a creamy dairy-free cashew cream sauce. i think about this bowl more than i'm comfortable admitting lololol. you can find a step by step below. sauce details there too! i use this dreamy spread in loaded veg bowls, on stews, spread over toast- options are endless here. 

butternut squash black bean stew (inspired by the pumpkin and lentil stew from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- can rinsed and drained black beans 
- cups diced butternut squash
- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
-/ cup diced mushrooms
- cups water
- can diced tomatoes
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add mushrooms. cook for a few more minutes until softened. add the black beans, butternut squash, tomatoes, spices, and water to the pot. bring the mix to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. once the water has reduced, add any last spices based on your taste preferences. 

garlic cashew cream: 

to a blender add:
- cup cashews soaked overnight (drained)
- cup water
-/ cup olive oil
-/ cup lemon juice
-/ cup nutritional yeast 
- garlic cloves
-sea salt

blend until smooth, then pour into a glass jar fitted with a lid. store in the fridge for up to a week (will thicken as it sits, so feel free to thin with some water before serving if desired)

weeknight vegan chili

 chopped onion
 stalks celery, diced
 large carrots, diced

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
roasted red pepper cashew cauli mac:

make the cashew cream ahead of time by blending the following: -  roasted red peppers
-  cup cashews (soaked overnight or in hot water for at least two hours, then drained)
- / cup water
-  tablespoons olive oil
- sea salt
- splash of maple syrup
- splash of lemon juice

for the stew: -  onion, diced
-  head cauliflower, cut into florets -  can rinsed and drained chickpeas
-  can diced tomatoes
- / cup unsweetened almond milk
- / cup nutritional yeast
- cashew cream (above)
- sea salt

in a stovetop pot, sauté the onion in oil until browned. add tomatoes, cashew cream, nutritional yeast, and milk. bring heat to a boil, then reduce to medium heat. simmer for about  minutes before adding in cauliflower and chickpeas. bring heat back to a boil and mix thoroughly, making sure the vegetables are coated in the sauce. reduce to a simmer and cook for about - minutes. i like to break up the cauliflower toward the end for texture. add more salt to your liking!

 bag escarole (about  cups worth)
 can of lentils (i use either canned or boxed lentils to save time)

over medium heat sauté the garlic in sea salt and olive oil until soft. add in the escarole in increments and let it cook down until tender. once all of the escarole has been added and cooked throw in the carrots and more olive oil. cook for about ten minutes or until carrots are soft. add the lentils in at the very end with more sea salt and garlic powder and cook until warmed all the way through! .

boil a pot of water for the pasta (i use @traderjoes quinoa and brown rice fusilli!). in another pot sautéed onions in sea salt and olive oil until browned. toss in carrots and more oil if needed and sautéed until soft. then throw in steamed lentils and cook for about five minutes. next add in your sauce (i used @raoshomemade) and cook on low until hot all the way through. add the pasta to the boiling pot and cook and drain. a few minutes (like ) before the pastas done i cover the sauce with a lid and let it sit with no heat to let it get thick. once the pastas done too with the sauce and that's it!

 can butternut squash puree
 can rinsed and drained white beans
 onion
/ cup chopped mushrooms
 zucchini 
Olive oil
Cumin
Sea salt
 tablespoons maple syrup
 cups vegetable broth
 can tomato puree
 can filtered water

sauté the onion in olive oil, cumin, and sea salt until fragrant and browned. toss in diced zucchini and mushrooms and cook until tender. add white beans, tomato puree, butternut squash puree, vegetable broth, and water to the pot. turn heat to high and cook until boiling, then reduce to low heat and partially cover with a lid. now you're cooking the sauce down until the liquid is absorbed and a thick mixture forms (I stir every  minutes for about  minutes). at the very end i added the maple syrup. once the liquid is mostly absorbed it's done!

no matter how the upcoming holiday is for you, i hope you can take things day by day and take whatever reminder(s) you may need below with you:

- you don't owe anyone an explanation about your weight, your appearance, or what you are or aren't eating.
- it's okay to set boundaries and take the time and space that you need.
- “no” is a full sentence.
- what somebody else eats has nothing to do with what you should eat. keep your eyes on your own plate.
- hurtful words are often more a reflection of the person who said them than the person who received them.
- chosen family IS family.
- you are allowed to do what it takes to preserve your peace and energy.
- if thanksgiving is hard for you because of grief, a complicated family situation, financial hardship, trauma, physical or mental health battles, or anything else, you are not alone.

made this pie using the “apple pie recipe with the best filling” from @natashaskitchen. so so good and an extra reminder that you CAN use regular all purpose flour and sugar in your thanksgiving recipes and feel good about eating them.

i'm ALSO excited about the things blake and i have planned to do before he leaves, happy i'm able to take a couple days off of work this week to take a break and spend some extra time with blake, grateful that i live close to family, and accepting of where i'm at.

duality is something i have to remind myself often is OKAY to experience especially when it sometimes feels like gratitude, positivity, and moving on are the only acceptable responses to hard situations.

if you need to hear it:

you can experience joy AND feel sad.

you can accept what you can't control AND feel angry.

you can be grateful AND wish things were different.

you can feel hopeful AND be worried about the future.

moving to philly was one of the hardest things i've ever done. it's the first time i've ever lived in a city outside of my hometown, and to be honest, the big move completely rocked me. but, sometimes you need to be broken down to be broken open, and embracing change and the hardships that come with it is one of best things you can do for yourself. since moving to philly, i've learned so much about myself and my career, strengthened my relationship with my fiancé, became a dog mom, and had so much fun exploring this city that i currently call home!

Eagles football is big here, and @dunkin's fall drinks which include the nutty pumpkin coffee (available iced or hot), the iced chai latte, which for in-app Perks members can be leveled up with pumpkin cream cold foam, and the blood orange Dunkin' refresher are the perfect way to fuel up and cheer on the Eagles!

if you needed a sign to make the move, challenge your fears, leave the situation, speak up for yourself, speak up for others, wear that outfit, or do whatever else feels hard and scary, consider this it.

choosing recovery and/or pursuing food freedom can sometimes be made out to seem simple and easy. they aren't. in fact, choosing food freedom in a society with body ideals is really really hard. but, it's definitely worth it, and here are some reasons why:

- the ability to be spontaneous
- more mental space for things you care about
- better mood
- being present
- connecting with others
- more energy
- better focus on important tasks
- being more in tune with your body
- feeling empowered
- enjoying new foods and drinks

& many more!

i love trying seasonal food and drink specials, which is why i was SO excited tor the return of @dunkin's summer specials, which include the cake batter signature latte, the butter pecan iced coffee, and the mango pineapple dunkin' refresher.

hot humid philly summers are made better with a summer @dunkin drink in hand!

while i've been enjoying living alone and embracing all that comes with it, i also love the physical presence of other humans.  especially during quarantine, when i'm alone in my apartment, i sometimes struggle to navigate all my feelings without the physical presence of someone else there to help me feel supported.

as someone who tends to distance myself from others when i experience difficult emotions, i have to remind myself that just because i can do things alone, and it may even feel easier to do things alone, doesn't mean that my life is better when i do.

i'm so grateful that blake's here because hugging him for the first time yesterday felt like a big release. his touch served as a reminder that i don't have to just act “fine”, and a life where i let my guard down, allow myself to be vulnerable, and let others in is a more fulfilling one.

on the agenda today:
coffee, a morning walk together, eat a nourishing breakfast, work, spend the afternoon at blake's parent's house, get dinner with my parents, & chill back at my place

swipe for coffee pours —>

blake's: chocolate syrup drizzle, @lacolombecoffee cold brew, and @elmhurst hazelnut milk frothed together w/ @shopkarenberrios cacao + maple syrup

mine: @lacolombecoffee cold brew and @elmhurst hazelnut milk frothed together w/ pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, + maple syrup

- bomb food & drinks at momocho (@momochochef)
- exploring the east side & spending time with my family
- going to some of our favorite local coffee shops (@heartwoodcoffee & @risingstarcoffee)
- going out for ice cream (@masonscreamery & @jenisicecreams)
- watching the browns & spending time with blake's family

there are a lot of people who don't really understand why i'm in a long distance engagement, and i get that because i know it's not the “norm”. but, blake and i are happy (not to be confused with perfect) in our relationship, and what works for us, works for us. 

with pretty much everything in life, there's some relative idea of what's “normal”, and most of us try really hard to stay within the confines of “normal” because we all want to be accepted, do what's “right”, and avoid the judgements and disadvantages that being “abnormal” brings.

choosing to adhere to norms is not inherently bad (it makes sense to want to!), but if it's keeping you stuck, causing you harm, or making you unhappy, it's OKAY to do things differently even if it means being “abnormal”.

this is all to say that normal is a social construct, and normal ≠ better even if society makes it feel like it.

happy monday & stay radical 🤘🏽

thank you sooo much for all the love i've received in the past  hours!! 💍 i am truly grateful for every single one of you who choose to follow along here, write comments or send messages (it's hard for me to respond to them all, but i seriously appreciate each and every one of them), and offer me your love, support, time, and energy.

i know it may seem a little odd to say, but here's a reminder that we are allowed to feel JOY and experience HAPPINESS. even among grief and sadness, even if we aren't where we want to be, even if nothing “special” is going on, there is space for joy, and it is a gift that is too precious not to treasure and hold onto.

this week is filled with a lot of different feelings and emotions, and everyone's holiday week may vary drastically. please please pleaseeee remember that there is room for all feelings and to be kind to yourself and those around you.

pictured here is vegan chocolate and taro swirl soft serve that blake and i enjoyed from @masonscreamery yesterday! sometimes the simple joys are some of the best joys 🤍

Doc ID: 24525, distribution: 0.9971320629119873 ; i need ur help it takes  seconds
 
 so im entering a contest to try and win free tickets to go see flume (my favorite artist who's music has kept me alive since high school) in colorado this summer and this is gonna be a REALLY longwinded post but ill put the link here and if you “pre register” this little form for me aka enter a phone number and email for me, i get  points which helps my odds.  
 if you have more than five seconds, continue reading and i will elaborate on why this means so so much to me: tw abuse i wont go into detail but yeah 
 this would be the second time i'd be seeing him at red rocks. unfortunately my first journey across the united states to colorado was terrible. this was a few years ago, in / ish. i drove with my abusive ex, about  hours. he sexually/physically/mentally/chemically abused me the entire time we were there. the majority of the trip was spent in a hotel room, giving him sex.  
 seeing flume was an amazing life changing experience, hearing this extremely special music in front of a backdrop that's too beautiful for words. i even got to meet one of my internet friends for the first time at this show, she's a living breathing angel. this was supposed to be a good trip, but unfortunately i couldnt enjoy it to the fullest because of my ex. 
 im gonna try and explain this the best i can, sorry if its not cohesive. my ex convinced me to take cocaine for like the second time in my life at this concert, it wasnt my idea but he insisted. i could've been content stopping after my first time… cocaine and i do NOT mix but at the time i didnt know this so i just took it, i didnt see or predict the long term harm it would cause when i turned into an addict/abuser months later. to make matters worse, my ex bought it off a random wook who was lurking the parking lot before the event. so imagine this concert - im “coked” up on miscellaneous powder, and im doing my flow art. 

i “glove” for fun, its basically hand dancing but with LED lights attached to your fingertips with white gloves, depending on how you move your hands and fingers you can make shapes and patterns with the lights and its cool. its considered a “flow art” and its one of the very few things i enjoy doing. im listening to flume, flowing, feeling FILLED with love, and then all of a sudden my ex turns to me and says “can you stop doing that” so he could hold me / grope me to the music instead. 
 word to the wise, if you ever see someone EXTREMELY involved in a task, and they're having fun - dont ever, ever, ever, ever, ever… tell them to stop. unless there's a tsunami coming. that shit is heart breaking. i couldn't bring myself to enjoy the rest of the event or put my gloves back on, i just completely retreated inside of myself. all i could do was stare ahead at the stage and hold my own hands/cross my arms. 
 the night got worse, much much later after we dropped my e-friend back off at her home, we were driving back to the hotel in my vehicle. my ex started to lose his mind and was blowing red lights. literally would stop for the light, and then would go through it before it ever turned green anyways. i kept asking him what the fuck was wrong with him and to pull over and his only response was “i dont know sorry” and he would just keep going. back at the hotel, he threatened to fly home and leave me alone with my car across the country twice. looking back, i should of let him. 
 the one other time we left the hotel, i wanted to go to pike's peak. pike's peak is a k ish foot mountain. the weather was beginning to get inclement as we drove to the top. i am absolutely terrified of heights (have had recurring nightmares since childhood about driving straight off of mountains) and was crying in the passenger seat the entire time. there are no guard rails in most places driving up to the peak so you can imagine my terror as im letting this beans for brains of a man drive my vehicle , feet up into the air, he cant even tell green apart from red. when we reached the peak it was beginning to hail and thunder but i wanted to get out just to take a single picture to celebrate the fact that i made it… as soon as i got out and took my picture - lightning struck the ground no more than  feet in front of me and i felt it shock my feet, even with rubber soles. we promptly left after that. i kept asking the universe for a sign while i was there, and in that instant it gave it to me. not the sign i was looking for but a powerful sign nonetheless. 
 the rest of the trip was filled with tears and sex that i didn't want to have. an ATM machine ate my debit card in downtown colorado so i didnt have any money on me at this point. we almost didnt have enough money to get home, my ex had to overdraft his account and luckily we had just enough cash to get back. when we embarked on our journey home i was driving for about  hours when i got pulled over in iowa for speeding. my ex had gotten pulled over for speeding on the journey TO colorado but the cop had let us go. this cop wasnt feeling as generous, he illegally connived me out of my car, prolonged the traffic stop, bullied me into sitting in the front seat of his cruiser - and then he interrogated us separately. eventually my ex admitted he had weed in the car. we gave it to the officer. 
 the officer only gave me a possession charge even though the weed belonged to my boyfriend. this cost me $, that i did not have. come to think of it, this is the event that triggered the snowball of financial problems im currently still suffering from. i had to hire a lawyer in iowa so that i didnt have to go back there for my trials, he was the only lawyer who answered my calls. 
 after  and a half hours the cop let us go (on the police report he said i looked “drug sick” but told me to my face that he was only letting me go because “his niece struggles from an eating disorder too”… yeah i used that as an excuse.)  i blacked out from stress and hit my head extremely hard on the windows inside my car. that was the first time i gave myself a concussion. we barely got home in one piece lol. 
 the relationship was over once and for all after that - even though he said he'd help me pay for the charge, he never did. this same ex was stalking me at a festival a month later - , people there and somehow he found me and was following me at one point, aggressively questioning me and my now-boyfriend. then a month later, he attacked me and my now-boyfriend at another concert. i was facing the stage and someone punched me in the back of the head, when i turned around my ex was attempting to grab onto my now-boyfriend. everyone in the vicinity was getting hit and shoved, and it was chaos. my ex ran off before security could come. i now have a restraining order against this person but thats about all i could do. i tried to press charges but the courts messed up the case and dropped his charges. i worked with a detective, i drove an hour downtown multiple times, i showed up to court the first time EARLY, : on the dot, he didnt even show up. the scheduled him a re-trial and told me i didnt have to come next time, so i didnt. and because i didnt show up, they dropped his case. 
 super long story short i really want to go back to red rocks because since the last time i went there, my life has been nothing but trauma after trauma. i dont really have the money at all to buy show tickets and plane tickets but i will probably buy them anyways at some point and end up going alone if i have to. i have nothing else to look forward to in life and this man's music has single-handedly kept me sane and on this earth since  and i really want nothing more than to just feel reconnected with him again. this will be his only show in north america this year. 
 right now all my money needs to be going into fixing my truck that i have to turn back in, in july. flume will be at red rocks in august. if i can pull my life together and get this car returned with no problems by july, i'm going to quit my day job (which has had me extremely suicidal for months and months now) and i'm going to enjoy being car-less for a month or a few until i can save up for a new one. i will subsist on my garden money and maybe i will go back to college. maybe i will move out of the state. i dont know. all i know is that a lot of my responsibilities are worries will be alleviated by august. since the last time i went to colorado i've felt cursed since, and i really just want to go back and heal that part of my life that still hurts me a lot. i dont know. its a beautiful state and i'd like to try and make peace with it and myself. and i miss my friend, we're both so much more grown now and i'd like to hang out with her again while i'm not on cocaine/being influenced by a looming man thats dulling my shine. 
 if you've made it reading this far i love you and im sorry for making you bare witness to my weird painful stories but it would really mean the world to me if you could click the link i listed and enter your info - or any info. if i won these tickets it would be an absolute miracle and would really help make up for the past few years that i've been scraping through.

In order to get both babies up, fed, changed, dressed, fed again, bags packed up and baby  dropped off with friend in time for me to get to the hospital with baby , I had to start the day at .am.  Thankfully we made it all on schedule. Two babies is physically exhausting compared to one (obvious I suppose but it's easy to discount the double exertion involved.) It's like running a km but using all the energy of a km. Two babies and an oxygen cylinder (it is NOT “lighter than air” - it is actually very heavy!) in and out of car seats, in and out of the house, in and out of the car…. We all made it home for .am, just in time for me to eat breakfast (👍) then take d to her friend's house to head off to Greece for two weeks, lucky girl! Got home from THAT about midday ahhhhh It's been a quieter afternoon inside but thunderbolts and lightening outside. Thumping rain. It's .pm now and I'm counting down the hours to baby bedtime. Although last night, baby bedtime was an extended period that went on till .pm ugh 😴 so hoping for nearer pm tonight. I am escaping for a swim and a relax in the spa at .pm, whether they're asleep or not. H can take over at that point!

Doc ID: 14671, distribution: 0.9742732048034668 ; Life update  Yesterday I went to see our last foster baby for the final post placement visit. Because of lockdown we met in a park for a walk. Unfortunately it was cold, icy, drizzly and misty, so not the best conditions but it was lovely to see her again and she was so happy to see me. She has my heart forever ❤️ We are still taking a break from fostering just now, although our social worker emailed to ask me if we were ready to go back on the active list. I said I'd let her know. I'm thinking of this time as my “annual leave” so I'm enjoying having a bit of time and space to relax (and supervise home-learning, cope with lockdown etc). I got all my boxes of baby clothes out yesterday and sorted them back into size order. They tend to get all muddled up as I'm taking stuff out and putting it back in during a placement. I met a friend for a nice long walk yesterday afternoon. She updated me on the domestic violence situation. The abusive adult child has temporarily moved out as things got really bad and the police had to be called again, which meant social services got involved again, which means she risks losing her two year old if she doesn't get him out of the house. Before he moved out, my friend also had the mum and two year old to stay in her house for three nights to keep them safe. She doesn't know if she's enabling the mum to not kick her son out by providing a safe space. Then after she's told me all this, she says don't tell anyone. I don't have anyone to tell and I feel like the pressure is off a bit because things are happening (police, social services) to keep the little one safe. I don't feel the same stress as I did a week ago. The mutual friend I did drop some pointers to had the mum and little one round for lunch and a chat, but the mum wouldn't share any details so my friend is still the sole carrier of this secret. My friend and I still debate what the best way to support the mum going forward is. It reminds me of Janet Treasure's how to support someone with an eating disorder, are you a dolphin or a whatever the other supporter-types were, I can't remember now. Today the sun is shining and we are hoping to go for a family walk. The UK news is full of one police force yesterday fining two women £ each for driving  miles from their house to go for a socially distanced walk with a cup of peppermint tea each, because they “left their local area” and “had a picnic”. Thankfully I don't live in the jurisdiction of that police force but I'm still not sure who decides where your local area ends. We want to drive a couple of miles and then walk. I think that'll be ok.

Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.9719064235687256 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

I got a text from d in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said “Can you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.” Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an  minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn't pass 😭. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn't a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I'd ordered wasn't there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn't ordered was there. So we made a profit of  packs of brioche,  packs of krispie cakes,  bags of crisps and  eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I'd sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d's medical needs, I was rather hoping my pm tutee would cancel, but she didn't. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D's bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I'm finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week's episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice. I'm nibbling on dark chocolate and raspberry coated almonds which I bulk ordered online as a nutrition dense snack to help push my intake up after my long runs.  Tomorrow I am hoping for a proper restful day. All my children may make it out of the house (d has improved as the day has gone on and hopes to make it back to school tomorrow) and I may even get chance to paint the bannisters!

Doc ID: 15241, distribution: 0.9662984609603882 ; Hello tumblr This week I'm coming to you from Cornwall (for my non-UK followers, this is the very south west part of England). It was supposed to be Menorca, but eh… Covid disrupts the best laid plans. We left our home at am yesterday morning for the  hour drive. To Americans, I believe that's a standard day trip, but to us Brits that classes as “a very long car journey”. The traffic is notoriously bad on the route, causing long delays, hence the early start. Alarms went off at .am, we got up, packed the car and away we went. The girls promptly all fell back asleep, and H and I took turns to drive. At .am we stopped for brunch in a fab farmhouse-type restaurant (scrambled eggs on toast for me and full English for the other four), and by am we were in St Austell, dazedly walking round Tesco buying food for the next few days. d insisted on buying a giant watermelon. It's nice to be able to shop for holiday food without it being a huge eating disorder trauma, which it has been for me on so many family holidays. The only foods I “needed” us to buy were eggs and yoghurt, everything else I went with the flow of the communal decision making. I didn't even buy salad leaves, I looked at them and felt grateful that I don't even need to spin off down a spiral of feeling the obsession to have them. Shopping is so much easier without an eating disorder shouting in my head! After much hilarity trying to fit four full shopping bags into our already full car (you probably had to be there, but we just stood there by the car with the giant watermelon in our arms wondering where it could go - eventually we strapped it into the seating part of the baby's pram), we headed on to the Eden project (pictured above). We were really a bit too tired to enjoy it properly but it filled the afternoon until we could get into our holiday cottage nearby. Then we safely arrived at our cottage, unpacked, and the evening passed in a haze of snoozing on the sofas and then bedtime. Food today:  scrambled eggs on toast, porridge oats bar, half a tub of chilli bean soup, many slices of french baguette with spread (I was really hungry and ate and ate the bread),  chunky ginger biscuits,  pieces of chunky hazelnut dark chocolate. I think I underate today but my hunger cues were all confused from the early start and then being too tired later in the day to feel hungry or care.

Doc ID: 15274, distribution: 0.9614055752754211 ; Question: How were grades predicted? What are A-Levels typically like? Answer: So because the exams were all cancelled due to Covid, their teachers predicted the grades. And each school also had to rank all the kids in each subject from highest to lowest. So if they predicted four B grades, they had to put those four in order from the most secure to the least secure.What has happened then is that the government in its infinite wisdom devised an algorithm to “moderate” the grades, and this has basically downgraded almost half of the nation's grades from the teachers predictions, by at least one grade and in some case two or even three. It's done it by taking the rankings the teachers provided and then some other system working out how many of each grade they think the school should have got and allocating the grades via the rankings. Unfortunately the way it's worked out how many of each grades each school should have has been flawed. The algorithm has favoured private schools (where pupils pay to attend) over state schools (where the majority of average peoples kids go). Sixth form colleges have come off worst of all. It's been a stupid flawed system that has caused a lot of heartbreak today. Best case scenario, the government has to do a U-turn like in Scotland and go back to teachers predictions. This will mean kids will overall get better grades than they would have if they'd sat the exams, but at least it will feel fair and not like they're the victims of a stupid computer programme. For example at d's school, no one got an A* (the top grade) in a particular subject. That means even though her teachers predicted d an A* and she was probably the top ranked pupil in the school in that subject, the government algorithm decided that no A* were to be allocated to her school in that subject. So there was no way she could have got that grade even though she totally deserved it.Sorry I've probably lost you long ago but it's such a hot topic right now in the UK and we are so furious and disappointed for our children over how it has worked out. To make it worse, we get to do it all again in a week for d as it's the turn of GCSE results (age  exams) and it will likely be just as shambolic.As to what A-levels are typically like, two years of a lot of hard work!

No more ridiculous algorithm for these results, they are back to using teacher assessed grades for the exams they never sat. d was very happy with her results, she can't quite believe they're as good as they are. She is not such a hard worker as d, although she has many other good qualities, but I like to think she would have pulled it out of the bag when it counted so she deserves these grades. This afternoon my bff came round for a catch up, which was lovely.  Then I went to meet an old school friend who was up for a couple of days. She has two children who are wheelchair users, so I was trying to find somewhere to go for tea where they would all be comfortable. I also had the baby in a pram, so we were quite a procession. Thankfully the venue I had chosen worked perfectly but I felt a lot of responsibility in picking the right place. Her children love the baby, so it was all a bit mad but we managed to have some sort of conversation over the heads of all the excitement and screeching (baby's new skill). After tea, I left them and went home, left the baby in the care of H and went out for a socially distanced team drink with the other baby and toddler group leaders from church. That was a much needed glass (or two) of wine. Now I'm home and packed because we are leaving for Cornwall at am 😱 trying to beat the traffic. One child is still out partying, H has just picked up another child and third child made her own way home. I hope they are packed and ready by am, whether they've slept or not!!

She just takes a long time to feed. Thankfully then she slept through till .am, which gave me time to wave all the girls off to school with a bit of individual attention each on the way. All three of them managed to walk several times past their piles of clean laundry on the landing though 🙄 but I think that's standard for teenagers. Baby fed and then I gave her her first bath since she came to us. She wasn't impressed and cried the whole time till she was snuggly wrapped up in a towel again.    I had to phone d's new school as the issues that caused her to move schools just won't die down. I think teenagers just don't think about what they're doing or what the consequences might be. I reported a threatening text d received to the police over the weekend so I'm waiting to hear back from them. This has gone on long enough. d needs the chance to settle at her new school without all this horribleness. Unfortunately the older brother of the girl who's caused a lot of the problems at the old school was moved to d's new school a couple of years ago, and he is now sticking his oar in with some horrible comments. Managed to shovel some scrambled eggs (and toast!) in while hustling around and organising, then took baby out to the contact centre to see her mum. While baby was in contact, I went for a run. It was hard hard hard. I ended up in a local cafe where I enjoyed a blissful  minutes sitting down with a coffee before going back to collect baby. We arrived home about .pm and it was such a relief to plonk myself down on the sofa. I've been waiting for the midwives to visit since then but there's still no sign of them. I'm suspicious they've forgotten. Nothing ever goes smoothly in foster care. I'm tutoring in  minutes and I could do with them having been and gone by then! Seems unlikely eh.

chocolate stuffed peanut butter cookie dough cups

inspired by @blissfulbasil!

cookie dough base: -  cup peanut butter -  cup coconut sugar
- / cup oat flour
- / cup almond milk
- vanilla
- sea salt

set the oven to  and line a mini cupcake pan with liners. using a hand mixer beat together the peanut butter, sugar, and vanilla until well-combined. add the oat flour and sea salt and beat on low until a crumbly batter forms, then slowly add the almond milk on top and continue to mix until batter is sticky. roll into small balls and place in the pan, using your fingers to press an indent in the center. bake for  minutes and then let cool completely (i placed in the fridge for a half hour). chocolate filling: - / cup @enjoylife mini chocolate chips - / cup coconut oil

place in a microwave-safe bowl and melt for  minute. the chocolate chips may not have melted completely, just stir them around in the oil and they'll melt in seconds. when the cups are cooled fill each cup with chocolate. place in the freezer to harden!

sweet potato fudge cookies with chunky peanut butter dip:

cookie: *  large steamed and cooked sweet potato * / cup coconut sugar
* / cup melted vegan butter
*  cup almond flour
* / cup coconut flour
* / cup cacao powder
*  egg 
preheat oven to . beat the sugar and butter until mixed. i used a hand mixer for this. crack the egg and mix together. do this again with the sweet potato (skin removed) until blended together. mix the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and add to wet using mixer. if the batter doesn't hold together well add more coconut flour as needed (it absorbs moisture). roll batter into balls and place onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. push down a touch to flatten each cookie and use a wet fork to make criss cross imprints on each. bake for - minutes. let cool completely and store in the fridge.

chunky peanut butter dip: * / cup creamy peanut butter
* / cup maple syrup
melt these in a microwave safe bowl for  minutes. it will be super thick so add almond milk to thin into a runnier mixture. i used creamy pb but when it cooked it broke into chunks! dip half of each cookie in the mix and sprinkle with a touch of coconut sugar. set on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and place in the fridge overnight or a few hours to set. .

Doc ID: 8119, distribution: 0.9623300433158875 ; catch me downing smoothie bowls all 👏🏼 summer 👏🏼 long 👏🏼 i refuse to have a smoothie if it's not thick enough to spoon, and i know there's lots of you out there who feel the same! here are my best smoothie bowl making tips that always deliver for me.
▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
• the ORDER of the ingredients matters! this is a point i've never seen anyone address and i've found it to make all the difference when building my bowls. i get the creamiest texture when i place my avocados in last. my usual order goes like this: chopped zucchini first, then rice frozen cauliflower, then whole frozen strawberries, then frozen blueberries, then fresh blueberries, then protein powder, then avocado, THEN pour nut milk over everything. i've found all of the ingredients blend better this way!
• the BLENDER can change the texture. i've posted this on my stories before but i have two different blenders at home and using the same exact recipe gave me two totally different results. my nutribullet tends to give a creamy texture but not very icy. i like my fruit ninja blender (but am getting a vitamix soon!)
• MILK matters! i just recently switched to @ripplefoods unsweetened vanilla pea milk for my smoothies and oatmeal. game changer! so much richer and creamier than almond milk.
•protein powder! my favorite is @nuzest_usa (code: “healthful_radiance”). i've tried so many plant based proteins but this is always my favorite! the vanilla pairs super well with frozen berries 👏🏼
• JUST enough of everything. i don't measure any ingredients, but a little goes a long way. i usually use half of a medium zucchini or one small one, and maybe /- cup of frozen riced cauliflower. i used to add soooo much of the cauliflower because i wanted more volume, but in the end it just makes it almost gritty because it's so icy.
• TIME! dont overblend the mix, i usually do two minutes TOPS.
• NOT a building tip but an important reminder: it's so easy to swallow a smoothie bowl in  minutes tops (guilty)! next time you eat one remember how much food goes into the mix. take the time to eat slowly and mindfully. you wouldn't inhale an entire meal of veggies and fruits that fast! 
now get blending babes!

Doc ID: 2405, distribution: 0.9786210060119629 ; REALITY CHECK❗️This is a body that has been working out consistently for a couple of years… 

The left photos are an example of what I personally used to expect a body to look like after working out & having a balanced diet. I also used to expect that someone with a “healthy & fit” body would automatically be “flawless” & confident too.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who believed this either… 🫢

We collectively have this expectation that confident, healthy & fit is: a rounded peach, tiny waist, flat tummy, perfect skin, no more hip dips or cellulite or rolls, with curves in all the right places… Right?

But the truth is, you can be confident, healthy & fit and:
🍑 still have a small bootay
⚡️have cellulite, hip dips, stretch marks, belly rolls, the works
🤰🏻 still have a lower belly bump
💪 not have noticeable chiselled abs or muscle
😮‍💨 not force yourself to workout in ways you dread
🍕be flexible with eating
💤 rest
🕺🏼have a body like the one on the right <

You can also be someone else's “ideal body”, but still experience low self-esteem & negative body image yourself.

Health & fitness isn't about abs, a firm booty, tight skin, nice biceps, poppin' quads & definition from head to toe. It looks different on everyone, it isn't a one-size-fits-all, and those fitness influencers you see online & strive to look like don't always look chiselled / either. They get bloated, they have cellulite, they have rolls, some even have loose skin (like me), and they get self-conscious too. 

So I hope this weekly series will continue to chip away at those unrealistic standards you've set yourself & encourage you to feel more accepting & loving towards your NATURAL, UNPOSED, UNEDITED, REAL self! You can't hate yourself into a version that you'll love, trust me, I know.

Happy Real Me Monday my loves xo

The last decade has seen the rise of social media… It has pretty much taken over the lives of not only teenagers & adults, but younger kids too… I grew up being influenced mostly by TV, magazines, celebs, models, radio & my peers — & that did enough damage to my self-esteem — so it scares me to think about how harmful it can be to grow up today in an era of social media being accessible at your finger tips ON TOP of everything else in the media 😮‍💨 so that's why I post this series every Monday, to remind you of what's real & to gently nudge you to be kinder to yourself.

Several studies have suggested that social media exposure fosters body dissatisfaction & results in risky eating behaviour by broadcasting thinness ideals, comparison, perfection, food restriction, over-exercising & unrealistic beauty standards. And while I don't deny that I am in a thinner body myself, I'd never want to portray perfection the way I have felt pressured to in the past… I want to be a safe corner of the internet that shows up authentically & uses this platform to encourage you to be kinder to yourself 💛

Let's not continue feeding the message that belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, blemishes, skin conditions, belly rolls, wobbly bits, body hair, skin colour, hair type, body shape, etc needs to be “fixed” or changed. None of those things make you “less than”. Our individuality is our magic!! Leave a “📱” below if you agree!! Have the best week my loves 🫶

Me when I just relax & stand up straight: 🚪 

Anyone else? 🙊 [ad]

But if you only accept your body when it looks a certain way, that's not self love, that's self objectification.

It's so easy for us to judge ourselves against others, but it's so important to remember that comparing:
✨ yourself to others
✨ your posed body to your relaxed body
✨ your achievements, job, productivity, every day life to someone else's online highlight reel
is TORTURE… & hardly fair.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love social media — but there's no denying that most share their best life & best versions of themselves on here, so it makes sense that we'll find ourselves comparing ourselves & our lives while scrolling through. 

Here are some things that helped me stop comparing myself:

🦋 Their beauty and/or success doesn't take away from yours
🦋 Perfection is an illusion - we only see what someone wants us to see. The photos that are posted are only % of someone's life. There are  hours in each day, and we usually only see a few minutes of someone's life online. (Myself included)
🦋 Bad body image days happen to us all — so if you think weight loss or a makeover is going to magically fix that, you're in for a shock 🙈 finding peace with your body & appearance happens when you start working from the inside out ✨
🦋 We're all living on a different timeline. Mark Zuckerberg might've created his multi-million dollar company in his dorm room as a teen, but Vera Wang didn't design her first dress until . 
🦋 Beauty is subjective - you might not see your beauty, but you also don't see the way your eyes light up at the sight of puppies or sunsets, so how can you really ever know your true beauty when you've only ever seen yourself in a mirror or photos?

Doc ID: 2328, distribution: 0.9728824496269226 ; A dose of reality from my camera roll to spice up your feed & remind you of what's real… Because social media is filled with everyone's best moments & just because people don't always share their less flattering moments, doesn't mean they don't have them too! 🫢

Why would we try to attract others by portraying our most perfect, filtered selves? We're not two-dimensional, there are SO MANY layers to us… The way that we look is just our “external layer”. It's just our shell. It isn't a representation of what's inside.

By embracing my authentic self, I've drawn people into my world who see me as I am & accept me for ALL of my layers. I no longer feel compelled to maintain a flawless appearance or conceal my cellulite, bloated stomach, breakouts, loose skin, wobbly bits, feelings, or my love for food.

I no longer give the “flaws” in this video any power over how I feel about myself or how I live my life, because I gain nothing & lose everything by hiding as the shell of who I am.

Your “imperfections” aren't a source of shame or weakness. When you embrace who you are (inside & out), you're able to live a life aligned with your values, beliefs & true desires, rather than trying to conform to someone else's expectations or be controlled by FOMO.

When you're not afraid to show up as you are, you'll inspire others to be more authentic & vulnerable, creating deeper connections & a sense of community 🥹🫶

Being unapologetically yourself allows you to live a more authentic, fulfilling life. It's a powerful mindset that you deserve & only you have the power to give yourself 🧠 

So don't be afraid to embrace your “flaws” - they might just be your greatest strengths in disguise!!! 💪😙

Happy Real Me Monday!! This series looks a lil bit different this week, but I found all these snippets in my camera roll & thought they deserved a spot on the feed too 💗

You could be told everyday how beautiful you are by those around you, but you'll never see, believe or feel it unless you start viewing yourself for everything else that you are… because all the things that make you beautiful aren't found in the way that you look. You aren't your best or worst photo. You aren't your body or looks.

You are the warmth people feel when they see you laugh or smile, you are the kindness you show others, you are beautiful because of your story, your challenges, your strength, your ability to make others feel safe/seen/heard, the way that you light up when you're doing what you love, the confidence you have when you wear the clothes that make you feel good, the way you inspire others by owning your “flaws” & just being yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it when it's the least important thing about you. If you could be outside of your own eyes for a day, I think you'd see how much more you have to offer yourself & the world than the way your flesh sack looks. Please don't give it more power than all the light you have to shine ✨

(I post this weekly series to share what would've helped me when I was struggling with my body image, food & online comparison. I share these for my younger self, who felt a need to edit my photos to look a certain way online. There is nothing wrong with the left OR the right. Both are human, both are me, minutes apart. While I can't represent all bodies, I CAN showcase my reality & be part of the change I wish to see in the world. I hope to encourage you to be a lil kinder to yourself & live a life uncontrolled by the way that you look)🌷

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

💭 going swimming with your friends in the summer because your body was soft & wobbly.
💭 laughing until your cheeks hurt because your teeth weren't perfectly straight.
💭 wearing your fav shorts because you were embarrassed of your cellulite.
💭 sharing candid, real, happy photos of yourself because they “weren't aesthetic or perfect”.
💭 going into stores & trying on clothes without hating what you see staring back at you.
💭 saying yes to invitations & opportunities because you didn't believe you were good enough.
💭 hanging out with your friends in case you didn't live up to their expectations of you.
💭 wearing what you want to wear.
💭 enjoying all the snacks at the sleepover because food made you feel guilty.
💭 saying BYE to diet fads & creating real healthy habits, not restrictive ones. 
💭 living your life completely on your own terms.

Please don't give your looks more power than memories, love & joy. Please stop comparing yourself to others, you are not them, they are not you & your time is far too precious to spend it wishing you were anyone other than your unique self. Don't wait until you can no longer make the change. 

There are no limits or boundaries. You deserve it all. The confidence. The outfits you wanna wear (but tell yourself you “can't”). The acceptance within yourself to embrace who you are & share imperfect photos that are actually perfect because they're the real you. The self love. The life you dream of. 

The good news is, you can still go swimming, laugh with your friends, say yes to invitations, wear the shorts, eat the burger, go on dates, post the photo & embrace what you've got! As you are, right this very moment. Go & live this week as if you really were  & have just been granted another chance at living the full life you dream of 🫶

If you've ever felt insecure & negative towards these parts of your body, leave a '💛' in the comments. Let's show other women (and men) they're not alone in feeling this way, but I hope videos & reminders like these will slowly chip away at the negative self-talk & encourage you to accept or eventually even embrace yourself like I have.

Confidence isn't a one-size-fits-all, be kind to yourself & to one another, because we've all been programmed to never feel good enough & to always want to be more 'this' or less 'that' 🥺

Our thoughts become our reality. If I continued picking myself apart & thinking there was something wrong with my cellulite / my thighs touching / my tummy bloating, my mind would constantly cherry pick all the things I don't like about my body and I'd NEVER be happy or comfortable in my skin. But once I started seeing more REAL bodies online, being kinder to myself & accepting my body as it is without all of the posing, sucking in & editing, I started feeling more confident overall. Feed your mind and body kinder, more forgiving thoughts & watch your life change. 

YOU are wonderful & you are enough, okay? GOOD, ILY 🥰

Here's your weekly reminder to not punish yourself or compare yourself to others 🙅🏻‍♀️

Comparing my body to a super strong athlete doesn't make sense… Because I don't train hours every day for sport or have a lot of muscle on my body burning through energy.

Comparing myself to a curvy goddess doesn't make sense either… Because that's not the way my body is built. I'm built like a door, not an hourglass & THAT'S OKAY 👌🏼 

Comparing my relaxed, everyday self to the posed & perfected photos of people online is setting myself up for failure… Because it's not realistic. Most people only post their very “best” photos & you can't compare your % to someone else's %. 

The point is: comparison is the thief of joy! Comparing yourself to ANYONE doesn't make sense… Neither does setting someone else's body as your “body goals” because we are all unique, with unique habits, lifestyles, genetics, stresses, sleeping patterns, health concerns & body types (the list goes on).

It's so important to fill your social media feed with diversity, so you never forget that beauty & bodies don't just look one way. Find people who fuel positive thoughts & don't leave you feeling worse! At the end of the day, your appearance is the least interesting thing about you. Here are some things that matter more:

🧠 Your mindset
🤗 The people you love
💭 The memories you make
🤝 Believing in yourself
🕺🏼 Creating habits that bring you joy & purpose
🧖🏻‍♀️ FEELING good in your skin
🪄 Creating a positive space in your own mind
🙌 Not being your own bully
🧘🏻‍♀️ Looking after yourself internally 
👑 Not letting your body hold you back from the life you want!

Now go have an amazing week celebrating everything that you are! Happy International Women's Day ✊💗

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

Doc ID: 14933, distribution: 0.9692164659500122 ; Question: Hi Faith, I've been following your blog for a long time now and was hoping for some advice from you or your followers. I know about how your therapy journey started but do you have any advice for anyone starting therapy? After years & years of wondering, I'm now starting therapy next week. I don't have an ED and I kind of feel like I don't "need" therapy but I also don't really know how to feel happy & can't remember the last time I did. But I don't know whether a therapist could help with that. Answer: Ah I think a therapist could definitely help with that! Well done you for being brave and taking the plunge to work on something that you want to be different in your life. I would have also said I didn't “need” therapy when I started. Because I was keeping myself alive day to day and wasn't that what really counted? But you don't need to be on the verge of insanity before you can go to therapy. Wanting to improve your life in any way related to your mental wellbeing is a good enough reason to go to therapy.I am never sure how helpful it is to give advice about starting therapy, because I think every therapist is slightly different and going in with too much advice given beforehand means you already have expectations about how it should go. I don't know what sort of person you are, whether you find it easy to speak about how you're feeling or not. I also have a whole load of words now to describe my inner world that I didn't have any concept for when I started therapy, so I could suggest from my 'enlightened position' that you say this or that, and you might look at me like I'm talking a foreign language. I think just turn up and try and be as straight up as you can. Tell the therapist why you've come for therapy, and let them take it from there. For me, because I'm quite avoidant and reticent in therapy, sometimes I try and pretend that I'm someone who doesn't mind talking about these things, who doesn't get tied in knots over it. Because I truly believe there are people out there who are like that. So I try and pretend I'm one of them and that can help me just get on and say stuff without overthinking it to the nth degree. A bit like, Fake it till you Make it, although I'm not encouraging you to be fake in therapy, it's just brain tricks I try and use to help myself talk! Best wishes for your first therapy session, I hope it goes well and you click with your therapist. (Remember you can shop around for a different therapist if you find after a few sessions that they're not the one for you) xx

I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  “Oh yes, I remember” T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . “I genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?” That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the “time to end therapy” is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said “uh I don't have much time left”. T said “Does it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?” and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside.

Doc ID: 17232, distribution: 0.9540854096412659 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me “Do you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?”. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be “No”, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do.

Doc ID: 14932, distribution: 0.9535037875175476 ; Therapy .. // struggling to speak   I'm struggling to get started writing about this session, just like I struggled to get talking in the session.  I had things to talk about, although not in list format. It was more a stream of consciousness I'd written down. But although they'd felt important when I wrote them down, suddenly in session they seemed unimportant. I don't think they were but my brain became uncooperative. I sat in silence for some long periods, wrestling with my thoughts. I could feel T was there with me in the silence, I think she was frustrated on my behalf that I couldn't get going.  The first half of the session was a bit stop-starty, and I was half expecting T to comment that she felt we weren't really connecting this session. Which would have been a valid observation. I really wanted to connect, I just couldn't find my way through. T asked me if I thought that when my friend commented to me that my parents issues were 'generational', did it make me feel invalidated, like I couldn't believe myself about my childhood? Is that what was making it difficult to speak? I said that I didn't feel like it did. I said that I don't feel like I need to prove anything to anyone else, or to justify myself to other people. I'm not really interested in that. But I do want to be able to believe myself. I don't need to talk about it with others because I know we have talked about it here in therapy. T reflected that it was like she was a witness, and I said yes, exactly.  Eventually I managed to move on to asking T about when I started therapy. I wanted to ask her if she could see from the way I responded in those early therapy sessions, some of what my relationship and attachment with my parents growing up must have been like. A straight forward question, it seems, but it took me a long time to get the words out in a way that conveyed what I meant. T was patient and willing to keep trying till we'd got ourselves on the same page. Once or twice she reflected back and missed the mark, and kept correcting and pulling me back from the withdrawal that always comes when I feel she misses me. I briefly spoke about some of the things I'd believed when we started therapy… I was so so convinced that T would shout at me. I only fully stopped believing that after  years of therapy when she told me in an email that she was not really a shouty person. From my childhood, it's not hard to see where that belief of mine came from. T said maybe it would be good to think about what I believed when I started therapy and how those beliefs have changed now. I pulled a bit of a “maybe” face at her, and said really it was more like, here Faith was born… and over here Faith started therapy [I was gesturing with my hands]… and it's like making sense of the story, how did I get from there to here. How did I get to those beliefs I had when I started therapy? T got that. She suggested that I write down some of the things I believed when I started therapy and that could be our starting place for next session. Hopefully I can do that and not sabotage myself so much by not speaking. At least the second half of this session felt more connected and flowed more easily. T is away the week after, so that puts added pressure on next week to be a good session and leave things in a good place for a week break. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16349, distribution: 0.9498260021209717 ; Therapy .. // ending talk // part two  Then T said “but you brought up last week that you had been thinking about ending therapy….” I haltingly explained my thought processes around that. Mostly thoughts that ending therapy is a necessity at some point and that I want the ending to be well managed and enough time to do it properly, not have it forced upon us by external circumstances. I said that I hadn't intended to say it last week but I felt like after T had brought it up, I felt like I had to say it because if I waited till this week to say it, it would seem like I was just saying it sort of as a defence to what T had said. T said I was making good progress, some big leaps, in therapy and if I wasn't making any progress, she would be suggesting we finish. But I am making progress. I was thinking, are you talking me out of finishing? It felt a bit like that, even though she said “I'm not saying that I think we should finish this year or that we shouldn't finish next year” I do trust that she works very ethically and she has supervision, so I don't think she would talk me into staying as a client if she didn't think it was best for me. I asked “but how do you know when you're ready to end?” T said “Hmm I think you just know” I said “Yes but when we have a foster baby, imagine if there was a family all ready to adopt them and social care said to us, when will you be ready to say goodbye, what date would you like the move to be? I would say never. I'd never be ready. It feels like that with therapy.“ I said “On the other hand, I'm never going to know if I can cope with stuff, the stuff that will inevitably happen, without therapy, until I actually try it.” T agreed with me and talked again about how when we felt like the time was right, we could cut down therapy sessions, first to every fortnight for a while, and then to once a month. So we would have time to see how I coped without therapy in those in between times and get used to managing things myself. T said “Maybe you need to hear that this is about a relationship, for both of us. That we will both grieve it when it's ended. To do long term therapy, it has to become a relationship. We have a meaningful relationship and there will be a time of grieving when it's over.” We had lots of eye contact and I felt our good connection while she was saying this. After she'd said it, we sat quietly for a few moments. “How does it feel in your body right now?” T asked. Ugh I can't answer that. I scanned my body but there was nothing in particular there. I felt sad but it all seemed to be in my head. T said she felt a tightness in her chest and throat, like you might feel when you were sad. Even with her prompting I couldn't answer her question though. Eventually I told her “That's a too-hard question”. We sat quietly again. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14462, distribution: 0.9422426223754883 ; Therapy .. // no change please  We had a slightly awkward start to this session (when do I not have an awkward start?) as I always struggle with those opening lines and how to get going. Also T seemed completely fine and oblivious to the fact that I might be unhappy after last session. I think whether she picks up on it or not, she always opens the session in a neutral way rather than pulling in the mood that the previous session ended in. That gives me the option of picking up from last session, or starting with something fresh. I'm going to try and write in a way that shows how we repaired our rupture. I guess anyone in a long term therapy relationship experiences ruptures and they probably all get repaired slightly differently depending on the therapist and the client and the situation.  “Can we talk about last weeks session?” I asked haltingly. T was still all happy and I think oblivious to the fact that all was not well after last week. She nodded and said “Yes of course” and then waited. “Uh… so when you said what you said about therapy changing…” - T nodded and remembered what she'd said - “well, why did you say that?” “Well it was an observation I suppose. It's good to notice how therapy is going.” “Mmm… It felt like you were saying you wanted to change things.” T said that she thought it was more that she was noticing things that had already changed. She talked about when I'd had the episode with my neighbour that upset me, and how I had known that I was triggered because it reminded me of my dad. “That's when I thought, oh Faith is further along here that I'd realised. She doesn't need me to make the connection for her anymore.” I said how scary talk of change is for me and how it unsettles me that T might change things in therapy. T repeated that maybe what she really meant was that she had noticed I had made progress and so there had already been change, and she needed to move with it. That's what she had meant when she said it, rather than she wanted to deliberately make a change from how we were doing things now. I felt reassured on that front and some of that fear that she was going to deliberately engineer sessions to be somehow different started to ease. After about  minutes of conversation, I paused and T asked if we had covered that now. “Shall we park it there now…. or do you want to keep talking about it?” I was so not done with talking about it! I still had a lot of thoughts that I hadn't said yet. Little did T know! It took me a minute to get the words out, “I think I need to keep talking about it” 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15811, distribution: 0.9399635791778564 ; Therapy .. // starting and ending  I really struggle with the start of therapy sessions - moving from that “everyday-life” mindset into the therapy space. And then I struggle again at the end to get back out of the therapy space. I only really registered that it's difficult both ways last session. I think my therapist thinks I am more aware of the time than I am. I often find I glance at the clock about halfway through the session, but then I get deeper into things and I don't look at it again. At the end of last week's session, I was talking about something deep, and then paused to think and then suddenly T was saying “so how about before we end, let's talk about something lighter… how about you tell me about what you've been up to with your family in lockdown”. I was a bit taken aback by the sudden transition from therapy material to surface stuff, and I struggled to find my way out of my head back into the world again. I often feel like I'm far away and the jump back into present time is too hard. I tried to wrestle myself back up to the surface, but in the end I just said to T, “I don't like it when you do that!” She took that on board and asked me how I would rather end things. “Would you rather just keep on talking about deep things right until the last moment?”  “Noooo…. it just feels like too much of a jump though. Too sudden.” I need her to wrap up what we're talking about a bit more, even if it's just saying that we'll carry on talking about it next week but we need to start bringing things to a close now. I know I am bad at ending on time. I never take responsibility for it. If T doesn't end the session, I just keep talking. I don't like the ending, having to leave and not see her for another week. She does have to gently push me out a little bit at the end. She usually does it by talking about scheduling for my next session, and at that point I will take it as my cue to end. But until she moves into that, I figure she's still willing to sit there and be with me so I just keep going. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15833, distribution: 0.9398680329322815 ; Therapy .. // good end bad end  Then the second thing that rocked my world a bit was I'd talked about the controlling mind end being similar to my mum and the “good end”, and the greedy needy body end being similar to my dad and the “bad end”. I said I try and stay as close to my mum's end as possible, my mind in control of my body as much as possible. T looked at me and said “What if both ends are bad though?” I had a sudden feeling of intense panic/terror. If both ends are bad, where can I go? Where is safe? If this end is bad, what am I doing here? How do I know where in the huge expanse of middle is the right place to be? The floor has just fallen out from under me. It all felt very huge and real in the moment. T started talking about anger and how expressing not enough anger and too much anger are both bad and she was going on and on and on. I told her it wasn't really about anger but she said she was just using it as an example and carried on talking. I just let it wash past me while my thoughts whirled round and round in my head. She talked and talked and eventually I felt like my head was going to explode till I couldn't stand it any longer and burst out “Can you stop talking for a minute!” I'm sure she's supposed to be tracking me and seeing if I'm with her…. although I'll grant it was a bit hard on the iPad as she can't see where I'm looking with accuracy. Anyway, she had totally lost me and gone of on her own tangent. But when I asked her to stop talking, she did straight away. She said “Yes of course” then she said “Well done for telling me to stop talking” and “I'm glad you could say that to me”. I sat with my face turned away and my hand up in front of it for a while, taking some deep breaths and just trying to calm down a bit. Eventually T asked me what was going on for me right now? I said I was just thinking if both ends of the line were bad, then I thought I was safe but I'm not, and how do I know where to go? T said “It seems like your world has just shifted in a major way…”  I was a bit zoned out and sat mostly in silence for a few minutes, then T said “We have gone way over time, but I know this is a challenging place to end… I'm just wondering do you have a couple of minutes to talk about some more light hearted things….?” I sat in silence. I was a bit too deep in my thoughts to come out of it by myself. I could have done with T asking me a few more questions to pull me up out. But I know she was there with me. When I didn't say anything more, she brought the session to a close. I kind of nodded at her a few times and I did manage to say goodbye, she said “Stay safe” and I said “You too”. She said “Thankyou, I will do” and then I managed to end the call, which told me I must be partly back in the present because when I end therapy feeling really far away, I have to get T to click the call off. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15251, distribution: 0.939178466796875 ; Therapy .. // 👍  T's very first words after we'd logged in this session were “So, how were the A-level results?” She caught me by surprise a bit as I had intended to start by talking about her reply to my text, and instead I found myself answering her question. She followed it up with a couple of other questions, and then she asked me how I was after last session. She isn't usually as directive as this, with question after question. If I didn't have my stuff to talk about, I would be loving it.  I ignored her last question and said “Can I talk about something else first instead?” She said “Yes of course…. I just have a note in my diary that we would talk about endings this session, so I wanted to sort of tie up the loose ends from the last week first.” I nodded because I hadn't forgotten about the dreaded 'endings' talk, but I can't talk about anything more until I've got this said. I started, “I sent you that text about d's A-level results -“ T interrupted “Did you?”. She sounded surprised. “I don't think I got it” “Yes you did! You replied!” T scrolled through her phone. “Oh yes! So I did” “Uh, so, I didn't really like the thumbs up emoji for a reply. It felt like a brush off. Like I could have text you saying I was about to jump off a bridge, and you'd still have sent me a thumbs up.” T smiled “Yes, I see your point. I'm sorry… I think I was… let me see, what day was it… Thursday… oh yes I was busy doing my course and I didn't really register what was going on with the A level results till much later on” “Yeah… I think I just wished I'd not sent the text at all. I mean, I knew we were on a break so I wasn't expecting a big conversation. I just thought you might be wondering… you know, because we'd talked about d getting her results… so I wanted to tell you.” “Yes I understand, I'm sorry. I get things wrong sometimes…. It's actually important that I do, that I'm not perfect, because that helps you learn that we can make mistakes and we can recover from them, our relationship can recover. And I can't deliberately make mistakes! So that learning has to happen as an experiential thing, it happens organically in the therapy process and that's when we can look at it and deal with it.” And that was that. The conversation felt done. I think it gets easier to cope with these ruptures and repairs each time one happens. A few years ago, it would have taken me the whole session to manage to say what I was upset about. It really would. It would have completely sent me out of my window of tolerance, my anxiety over telling T how I felt would have been paralysing. I can take comfort from seeing how I've grown, and even though it still means uncomfortable situations, I can face the discomfort and disaster does not occur. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16168, distribution: 0.9386311173439026 ; Therapy .. // screenshot   ——————————————————————————————————— This is the second screenshot I sent T. It's from “The Attachment Theory Workbook” by Annie Chen. I don't own the book, I was just browsing through it on amazon. When I read this paragraph, it really resonated with me. T read it and set off talking about it head-on at mph, and then seemed to realise what she was doing and pulled herself back a bit and gave me space instead to talk about how it resonated with me. I think this was a moment when her head wasn't fully in the game to start with. I talked about how H comes at me affectionately and it makes me pull away because I am not a touchy-feely person. But then the more I pull away, the more I feels he comes at me and his need for physical touch or closeness overwhelms me. T said maybe his love language is physical touch, and I said yes I think it is. I feel bad for not liking it, and then I feel bad for not being that person who does like it. I feel like H deserves someone nicer than me. H's brother and his wife are very touchy-feely with each other, and I think that's how H would like us to be and I just can't. T talked about how she would work if she was doing couples therapy with us. What she said wasn't really news. I know the theory of how couples therapy in that context works. T said she really only has a hazy view of H, and that's because of my avoidant nature impacting how I talk about him. T asked me if had spoken to H about any of this, and I said no not really. I said we used to talk a lot, before we got married, and we did talk about emotional stuff. But then we had babies and then my eating disorder got really bad and I was very shut down. And now I'm doing well in recovery from that but it's hard to find my way back to connecting with H again. I told her about how we went for a meal a couple of weekends ago and I did tell H quite a lot of the recent stuff we've talked about in therapy, and he surprised me by how well he dealt with it. T talked about how we have built up my trust in her and my relationship so that I can talk with her about all this stuff. I said yes but I don't have that trust with H, I don't trust that he will know how to respond. And then I can't think how I would carry the conversation, and then it all feels too hard.  “I'm going to set you some homework this week, Faith. I want you to find a time to talk with H about some of this, even if you just go for a walk around the block. Maybe you could tell him some of the process, even before you get onto the content. I mean like, tell him that you get uncomfortable talking about this, or that you worry he won't know what to say.” I looked very unconvinced at her. I told her how it all felt hard work, and I wasn't sure I wanted it. I think I said it was too much hard work several times through the session. I want it, but at the same time I know it's hard and uncomfortable to push myself to get to it, and so sometimes I feel like I will just stick with how things are. Towards the end of the session, T said “I've changed my mind on the homework. We'll leave talking to H for now. Instead I want you to think about how you would like it to be different between you and H.” I agreed to that (although I haven't really done it yet).

Topic 8 : 
top terms: shit, ur, fuck, lol, bc, fucking, gonna, ass, literally, wanna
Doc ID: 24051, distribution: 0.9985464215278625 ; been havin intrusive “dont eat” thoughts lately because its literally the only part of my life that i can control (or rather, cant control sometimes depending on how much money i do and dont spend on other things) 
 im sick of my dad belittling me and telling me i dont know anything about shit and going into my garden and ripping shit up/taking shit down/changing things that i know i need. you literally cant tell me im a dumbass that doesnt know what im doing. i know that these plants need to be at  degrees. but go ahead keep turning off and now breaking MY ac units when im away from home. ill just let my plants fry at  degrees because dad says so and doesnt think that air conditioning is necessary in a literal fucking sauna in the summer 
 like im supposed to be getting along with him because im stuck at his house, stuck driving one of his old banged up discarded cars to school, stuck GOING to school because he payed for classes and now im obligated to not waste his money, stuck with fried ass plants that wont make me any money because hes been sabotaging my garden for the past / months every time i go to sleep or leave the house for more than  minutes. i literally cant do any better for myself rn and i cant relocate and things arent TERRIBLE here but i would STILL rather fucking kill myself or kill him before i go back to feeling like an autonomy-less fucking child that he insists on treating me like. im sick of him trying to control every aspect of my life and treat me like im a clueless fucking idiot. the hypocrisy is so fucking real its making me mad. im still miserable. i dont care how “proud” my family is of me for “doing the right conventional thing” i think its fucking stupid as fuck that i have to perform these tricks and jump thru stupid ass fucking hoops just to make anyone proud. i dont even want the pride. or the family. i dont want any of this shit anymore i dont want responsibility for a ghetto ass half ass garden that i cant even keep regulated and thats not gonna yield me any results. i dont even fucking want this laptop he just bought me 
 ive been getting by with outdated technology and cheap stuff that i could afford myself for years but it was putting me behind in school not having a working laptop or printer. and he handed my brother EVERYTHING he has. for the entirety of his life my brother has been a spoiled brat and all the $$ my dad makes went into my brother's hobbies and wants and gifts.  
 the last thing i want to sound like is ungrateful because im not. i cant even believe how nice the laptop is, ive wanted an msi forever. obviously i love it but ive had it for a day and im already realizing id rather not even have it just because of the implications of owing him. i cant even fucking stand him. one moment hes reasonable and the next he's making me want to commit murder because his cognitive dissonance is so thick is suffocates me.  
 so now i have this nice ass laptop that i feel guilty and ashamed of for even having. i feel undeserving. like my only worth is to perform well at school so the family can be at peace knowing im “oN tHe riGhT pAtH”. my happiness or my sanity or my interests will never fucking matter or be a good enough reason to earn anything whether it be respect or a laptop. its only ever about how things “SEEM to be going”. so as long as i can SEEM like im doing fine, everything in my dad's small, dumbass world, are. but im not doing fine. im still self harming. im actually self harming more frequently lately than i have in a long run of years. im still brimming with rage because nobody ever listens to me and when i do speak i get told im wrong and or unwise and or ungrateful and or inexperienced and or just plain fucking stupid. im over it. im sick of trying to appease a bunch of people who make my skin crawl. i dont care if its family and they “love me and want the best for me”. theyre all fucking stuck in their ways with piss and shit for brains and any complaint about unhappiness or discord in the home just gets shut down and band-aid'ed with “buh buh but!!! scKOOL!!! it will give u sense of PurPosE” “buh but focus on the GUD IN UR LIFE (which is… btw..?)” “buh buh heres an excuse as to why your grown ass father can act like an immature damaged joke of a human but you're required to grow personally and gracefully until the point where youve done SO MUCH personal growth that you realize that life is still futile regardless and you eventually snap and off yourself!!!” 
 if i kill myself now or if i kill myself down the line the result is just gonna be the same and i dont know why or how i put effort into leading my life anyways and suffering for now when i know in my heart of hearts that i want to go at my own hand and im probably going to still feel the same way no matter how many years pass.  
 
 
 sorry if this bothers anyone or concerns anyone (pls dont b lol) but i have nowhere else to say this and no friends to take this to and my boyfriend is obviously still useless when it comes to providing emotional support so here i am 
 
 idk all i can think about is “if u dont eat youll feel better” and i know that ill get some sort of sick sense of satisfaction but i also know how pointless self sabotage is. but when every other aspect of ur life feels sabotaged outside of ur control, then does it rly matter? 
 today i havent denied myself any food. i spent the last of the money i had on food. but thats.. thats it.  
 i have no more money rn so i dont even have the means to eat. i wanna be clear here that my dad does NOT pay for everything, he payed for my schooling only ( classes at a community college, he practically BEGGED me to go) and he purchased me a laptop to aid in my schooling. yes i have a financial safety net (tbh if ur gonna MAKE kids thats kinda ur job until theyre self sufficient but anyways) im still responsible for feeding and taking care of my animals and myself and paying all my own bills, electricity included. so yeah. food is lookin like a no go right now.  
 i have a  hour class tomorrow from  to  pm. im gonna see if i can make it through the day without eating because once i feed myself THEN i get hungry. if i just abstain entirely i can get over the hunger.  
 i have noticeably gained weight and i am extremely uncomfortable in my body right now. im used to my stomach being perfectly flat and now i have a bit of body fat on me so i feel like ive been spilling out of my pants the past few weeks. its not a good feeling. i have no means to comfort myself rn so maybe getting my body back to how im used to it being will bring me comfort. i always thought i wanted to put on a few lbs and fill out more but now that i have i feel totally out of place in my skin. i hate having to be hyperaware of sucking my stomach in. once you get used to having a flat stomach i guess you take it for granted. the self consciousness and a lack of funds for food have me feelin like this week is about to be a long one. theyre all long. i just want a break. i just want to feel happy and comfortable with my life and with my plants situation and my decisions but im not gonna while im living here. im gonna be stuck in this shitty ass spot for as long as it takes for me to get through college, hone an entire craft that idek if im passionate about, and then find another  to  thatll probably have more cons than pros to showing up and wasting away at for  hours a day even if im “doing what i love”. what i love is to go about my life unbothered. what i would love, is to not have to participate in this rat race at all. what if i dont want to have a purpose. what if ive already accepted my wasted potential and im perfectly happy doing nothing????

Doc ID: 23926, distribution: 0.9975615739822388 ; when u consistently get three hours of sleep a night because any  out of the  sick/old animals is dying and needs assistance somehow , its really a vibe to just sit up listening to the little crunches of one of the ferrets eating (praise the lord) and morning rush hour starting softly, growing in intensity, and then dying out again. no urgency here. no obligated participation to join the chaos happening on the street rn. just peace. knowing i'm doing everything i possibly can in life for myself and the animals. been feeling largely aimless for the past - years but having to push myself to these extremes has reminded me that i do in fact have a purpose and thats all i need to hang onto to get through life. all i need is like one singular rewarding purpose. growing weed doesnt rly do it for me because in the end it comes down to being for money, and not even enough of it. i want to keep people happy so i take less than what i deserve, and what is market standard. but with nurturing animals… you get that gratification. granted, theres also grief. so much grief lol. overwhelming grief. but knowing i can make them comfortable and loved in the end is worth it to me. raising animals, caring for them when they're young and healthy… its one thing. but tending to sick animals in the ends of their lives is a complete other. i need to learn how to let go of the grief. it comes in waves. it keeps me awake. the sleep deprivation isnt doing me any favors. but i feel like i have no other options. i have to do what i have to do.  i know i havent updated in a while. thank u to those who still check up on me / this blog. luna is finally stable in her insulinoma. her glucose is still low as shit and she was still losing weight last time i checked but with consistency in meds and handfeeding twice a day, shes able to patter around relatively comfortable and happy. we have minimal vomiting episodes now. stella is early stages adrenal disease, has thinning hair on her tail bc of it :( and shes got some terrible respiratory issues that arent responding to any of the treatments ive tried in the last - months.  i hope it doesnt turn out to be a heart condition. my  year old cat stopped eating because he developed a massive cyst above his eye, that is now draining out of an open wound in his nose after i started treating it. i cant tell if its getting better or worse. i woke up at am to him stuck behind my desk and strung up on my mouse cord, minutes away from strangling himself.   no idea what he was doing back there. my wires are pretty organized and kept out of the animal's way… or so i thought… it fucks me up how he managed to even get in that position. he wont eat water, keeps losing his balance, cant get comfortable, blood test results say he has early stages of renal failure. idk what to do anymore. i cant watch him because i need to get some sleep before my  hour long biology class today… my boyfriend is leaving for cali again and hes been so busy the last three days hes been neglecting me and it sucks that i just have to accept his poor time management as an excuse as to why hes slagging me off. if you drag me to ur house, then proceed to not go to bed with me, and i have to wake up to u “just getting off” world of warcraft at am one more fucking time im gonna hack ur account and SELL IT. he doesnt think he has a problem. but i certainly have a problem. im sick of promises of affection being made but never being carried thru with. he can find time to convince me to do anal on the premise of “back rubs before AND after” but cant find time to provide me the care or the promise after. always leaving me alone to fall asleep feeling sad and used. its :am rn hes supposed to come see me around am for like an hour before he leaves and then thats it for at least a month. i have a lot of resentment and sadness so i dont even know if i want to see him. part of me hopes he sleeps thru his alarms and fucks up just so that i can make a point of ignoring him so maybe he can know what its like to feel feel guilty and alone for once in his life.  
 
 i just texted him to not even bother today bc i want to spare myself the disappointment while im ahead. im turning my alarms off and im gonna lay down and shut my eyes and turn off my phone and try not to cry myself into asphyxiation like i always do. if i sleep now i can get like  hours before i have to get up and move about and tackle school.  
 ive barely been eating lately because im so overwhelmed and its so hard to prepare yourself nice food for not a lot of money when you live in the arctic tundra and ur stuck at a college all day with student facilities that are under construction and a broken ass car with no heat. i feel so stupid. i cant save money. i cant take care of myself. i cant maintain peace for more than  minutes. as soon as my animals die im not gonna have a fucking purpose anymore. im not even gonna be able to think straight or rest at all. i cant stop worrying and anticipating. times like this when u wish u had a mom or someone to tell u everythings gonna be ok. ive always sucked at comforting myself. my natural reflex to emotional pain is self destruction, not self soothing. i dont even know what to do. the oscillating catatonic panic attacks and the detached depersonalized episodes have been alternating so frequently that im even neglecting to go to the bathroom as often as i should. i almost pissed myself yesterday morning and i actually did piss myself today. i dont know why i try to fight my bodys cues. i dont know why i can take care of everyone and everything else but not myself.  
 i had a brief moment of hope there and now i just. i just need to shut my eyes

Doc ID: 23909, distribution: 0.9925042390823364 ; how annoying.  ive been getting  hrs of sleep a night for the last  weeks because of my animals. ive woken up in the night screaming hysterically for seemingly no reason, ive woken up to my animals having difficulties and in grave danger bitch in . seconds. im losing my balance struggling to dress and they just keep knocking so now im screaming hysterically and my window is cracked near the front of the house so all I hear is my grandma going “WHAT!?”. and then I realize it' my grandma. and then . seconds later I finally get this hoodie zipped over my bare tits and I clear a flight of stairs and finally get to the door and shes just driving away. like REALLY? what the FUCK was that? I don't even feel bad im not even going to turn my phone on and apologize for cussing at her unknowingly like im not even gonna explain myself because I just don't care. she lives  min away she can go home. I cant ever get one nice day of sleep. I don't know what everyone wants from me. im doing so much right now and im doing my best and I cant even turn my phone off and sleep for  hours for one fucking day when I really need it,. im losing my mind I just need to be left alone. she knows my cat died yesterday and if im not answering my phone why would you just show up and start frantically knocking. can you not knock and wait. I get that its cold but like realistically I don't know what the fuck she was thinking or expecting or wanting. people  never wanna help me they always just wanna bother me.  and im not even talking about yal. everyone on the internet his mostly either been supportive or apathetic which I appreciate/don't mind. but life doesn't exist inside of the internet unfortunately. I can only play escapism to feel better for so long until I have to come back to reality or get behind on it. I feel like im always being the bigger person and comforting everyone else in my life but nobody can ever afford that same courtesy to me and its really getting old.  the least u cld do is leave me the fuck alone so I can focus figuring out how to give myself the energy that im constantly giving everyone else. I just wanted some relief from the intrusive thoughts today but now we're up and at it since the dogs had to lose their fucking shit. I honestly hate these dogs im so sick of them.  I don't know why we had to have . everything was fine when I had MY dog, and my dad had his, . but then my fucking waste of space brother decides hE wAnTs a DoG tOo because its not fair that We BoTh HaVe OnE.  so my spineless father gets him a fucking dog that he cant even take care of for a WEEK and now we just have this dumbass untrained puppy taking up space and eating shit and making messes and fucking up the pack dynamic with the other .  my dog has always been challenging with behavioral problems and they've just gotten tenfold worse since this fucking rd dog came into our lives. now its to the point where she isn't even manageable for me.  I hate this third dog. hes not disciplined.  my dad doesn't discipline any of the dogs and he always enables them and undoes the work that ive put in with their unruly asses. I hate it.  I hate having  big dogs constantly in my way and trying to boss me around and lurk and steal me and my other animal's food. I never asked for that responsibility. I never asked for any of these responsibilities.  I have  animals that belong to me and THEY ARE MANAGEABLE by themselves but once you throw in the family cat with a tumor that NOBODY else was paying attention to or worrying about, and  other huge ass dogs that don't get adequate attention bc my dad and brother are pieces of shit who don't get up from their desks more than x a day tops. if theyre even here. so I get stuck tending to their asses.  im just over it.  I love animals but theyare taking over my life and not in a good way. literally my only friends are animals and theyre gonna die soon too and then im left with nothing. nothing done, no friends, no money. nothing. because I spent it all on  extra animals that I never even signed up to fucking have.  I signed up for . not fucking . the animals wont leave me alone humans wont leave me alone im literally ready to flip a bitch and explode because all I want is to be left alone.  if nobody wants to even try making me feel better, if nobody can bring themselves to be considerate for once…. then just LEAVE ME ALONE. WHATS IT GONNA FUCKING TAKE. most days I don't actually want to kill myself, sometimes I actually do. but these days I feel like I don't even have a choice and one day its going to be my only option because I cannot escape my frustration

Doc ID: 24243, distribution: 0.9912344217300415 ; made my first pound sale last night 
 well not a lb lol i was an oz short so  whole ass oZ 
 decided i dont want or need a dayjob this morning LMAO i got priorities. wont catch me working for no more ole boys or chaldo fools because someone tipped me off that thats the situation i was about to walk right back into and it aint worth my gas or time 
 why would i do that when i literally just made .+k in  minutes. it cant be reasoned.  
 
 im bout to renew my late ass $ car tabs, take my ferrets to the vet so i can get luna more prednisone for her low glucose, and get stella xrayed for her weird persistent cough that she only does x a night… bout to make a bunch of phone calls to my car company bank etc get my current custo service nightmare sorted. bout to ship a package. bout to thin my plants and clean my ballasts. bout to walk barefoot in the grass bc sweet relief. money is definitely my # stressor and when money is ok, im okay. as long as i have enough to get by comfortably and know i can make more, im fine. at this rate i can even start saving lol. ive been putting in the work for months and months and this is first real time im reaping any bulk results. complete game changer.  
 everything happens for reasons mans i dont understand it or know why but life is always aligning for me at the very very very last seconds in every circumstance and scenario… just gotta trust the process i guess. its so gratifying to finally have big results. here i was pattin myself on the back for finding a new employer but ironically enough ive come to the conclusion (of course the day im expected to come in for training… always last minute) that i can finally get away with employing myself for the time being instead w/ no worries.. makes me wanna cry lol. i was gonna go in just to be professional but if i go for a day im going to have to go for a whole week or two to collect a paycheck and i already know i dont want to do a week or two so im just gonna disappear n hope they forget about me. i just reconnected with one of the og's of all things blackmarket out here who basically knows everyone worth knowing n already got recommendations (aka guaranteed hire) to better dispensaries if i decide thats what i wanna do.  feels weird af to even have these options lol. im gonna eat some fruit, smoke a hash joint, go lay in the sun n then shower. my girlfriends, all two of them, have been petty passive patties to me lately but thats okay im literally not even worried about them bc i can now occupy myself with all the plots and plans i have now that im in a financially breathable spot and can plot and plan. i blocked my copycat friend up and down, and evryone she knows, (or so i thought) and it literally took her less than  hrs to notice, figure it out, and text me. i found the weasle and blocked her too LOL. my other remaining friend has  interest in my life and only her own so i dont blame her ima just return the favor 
 its kinda fucked up but mostly relieving how many frustrations and doubts that money can truly solve for me. “money isnt happiness” but it is peace of mind which equates to sanity which indirectly equates to happiness.

 anyhow… met some new interesting people. one of which is an award winning grower … holy smokes LITERALLY best pot ive smoked in my life ever AND i got this ole man to follow me back on ig. this guy was like  years old and i got a crush on him after spending  min talking to him fml:(. i feel like im never gonna find a dude whos mature so ima just save my crushes for ppl my parent's age i guess.  
 and thats all ill ever have is crushes bc i still got the ole ball n chain comin home from cali next month 
 honestly im relieved to just have a familiar face back around and assholery that i know how to predict n deal with. i cant handle foreign assholery, it throws me off because i dont know where it stems from or when its gonna happen so i can avoid it 🙄 glad i didnt decide to throw my relationship out the window for some pathetic cheapshot lol. i guess i cant call him cheap, he did buy my ticket tonight and drinks and gave me some weed n wax n donated $ to this pretty vendor girl's beauty table so she gave me a free facial cleanser and lip balm in exchange :') 
 i guess tonight was good because i met some pretty and nice girls but man do i get crowd anxiety at concerts now to the point where i cant even move let alone sway let alone dance even though i know how lmao :') i feel really shitty being called out on it by this dude. im dwelling on it. its like bro i never know when my ex is gonna appear and punch me in the back of the head ITS HAPPENED BEFORE AT A CONCERT SO U NEVER FUCKINF KNOW WITJ MY LUCK pls just give me a break im trying so hard to be normal and sociable and relaxed.   its not nice to keep ditching n distancing urself from someone in public who has social anxiety just bc they “look weird for not dancing” but i cant expect ppl who dont mean shit to me and arent close to me to accomodate my trauma n mental issues. ugh. whatever ive embarrassed myself way harder in front of this pos and he still wants to have sex with me so i dont know why im beating myself up over this.  
 ima stay focused on the nice interactions i had with approx  men and  women. thank god women exist. theyre so intuitive and forgiving they can like sense and soothe my anxious soul, literally the girls i met tonight are what helped me keep it together.  
 gonna play some red dead to wear my brain out so i can sleep n be ready to see him again tmrw to trim. ufhggg. didnt eat today and i feel like trash. gonna get up and fix myself some cereal soon but im so sapped of all my energy i feel like i cant move from this chair

 ugh. im s jsusuena FAAGHHH 
 im wanna puNCH SOMETHING :') :'(  
 and now im crying 
 ive been cycling thru all the negative emotions all day it feels like 
 rock bottom fucking sucks im trying so hard to just be happy and positive and motivatrf and responsible and like im just really failing at all of them. between being a worthy student and taking gen ed classes at a community college seriously because i wont do well if i dont, and recovering a  plant garden from heat stroke and learning curves, and finding the time and means to make money, finding the time and means to feed myself proper food which im also failing at miserably, and making sure my ferrets are % tended to and vetted and in cleaned environments and etc, and worrying about my damn dog, and my other damn dog, and the other damn dog, and the other damn do- sorry i mean my ¿boyfriend?, and dealing with my mentally unstable/unaware father (winning combination), and not having a printer which is integral to my school n my money, and not having a vehicle, not having any money for a new one, still having bills and debts im barely keeping up with, and showing up on time and ready to focus to therapy … like. between all of that. all i can feel is stress and negative emotions and idk what to do. therapy isnt really helping me feel better its just helping me think clearer but im clearly still generally.. miserable-ish so. idk.  
 im not expecting anyone to read this i guess typing it out also just helps me think clearer. instead of focusing on my emotions tormenting and overwhelming me, and my fucking cramps.. i can just brain vomit into a text post instead. im hungry and i havent eaten much the last few days but im also acutely disgusted with myself and i want to eat but i dont and im trying not to think about it because the fact that i cant and dont want to take care of myself makes me feel pathetic and that just makes me want to not take care of myself more and its just a vicious inceptionistic cycle and its disorienting and i feel like im in highschool again like im a teenager with no control over my life and thats the worst feeling ever because i barely made it through that part of my life lol

 i just wanna be well rested for tomorrow so i can get that shit over with. i have a lot to trim before friday, and this girl i met on facebook circa  is gonna drive a state up and come pick me up so we can go to this art exhibition downtown together - im rly excited to meet her she's always been sweet to me.  
 i need to have this fuckening house and my life presentable before she gets here… but if i keep this momentum ill be fine. i just hope my dad isnt a jerk and fuckin ruins anything. i had a new girlfriend over the other day and i gave him a heads up and asked him not to embarass me and he screamed at me and told me to get out of my face. thank god girls are so forgiving. i came outside to greet her with tears and she was immediately sympathetic and asked if i needed to leave. showed up with smirnoff ice's n everything…. idk why im overthinking this i just dont want anyone to feel uncomfortable at my house because im uncomfortable / …. :') 
 its nice to have some people back in my life that arent men tryna power trip over me or play games with me. speaking of which my ¿ex?boyfriend is flying back in on sunday… and he is assuming that everything is fine with us, and is expecting that im picking him up from the airport even though a lot of hurtful amd toxic stuff has been said and done on both of our parts that i still havent rly gotten any closure on. but oh well. my dumb ass is just happy to see him. i have a lot of physical labor bullshit thats been piling up in my garden and i need some fuckin' help and we have a lot of eachother's possessions still so we were going to hve to see one another anyways. im just hoping it goes smooth because last time i picked him up from the airport was probably my # worst day out of the last  months.. and we both almost died.

 learn how to cam / sugar. if its do or die you put that mask on and you make what you gotta work, work.  
 learn to flip drugs. extremely easy profits. only requires one good connection whos willing to front you. and of course multiple smaller connections on the buyers end. you went to public school, didnt you? theres your clientele. doesnt even matter if they liked or like you. theres always a demand.  
 exchange a talent for cash instead of just plain whining about your life for it. can you draw portraits of people? can you offer to write papers, or do homework, or take on chores in exchange for cash? can you do ANYTHING at all? if you have the resources and capability to get word out to ask strangers for $$ ur def capable of getting an advertisement out with the same damn plea on it for exposure.  
 collect &take back pop cans and bottles 
 coinstar if ur lazy or change rolls if u have time to go to a bank. which u should have. if ur unemployed u have time.  
 start babysitting or petsitting. use a website or put up signs.  
 shipt or doordash if you have the means.  
 
 like its literaly so easy to make yourself useful. i know what its like to feel broke and helpless. but you never are. you can always go do something about it. even if its little.  instead of just publicly voicing ur entitlement to other peoples money and doing nothing SMH

 sorry. pet peeve is people who spread germs. stay the fuck home if you dont feel good or if any of your orifices are leaking. some of us have compromised immune systems/heavy workloads/busy schedules/no health insurance and cant afford to be sick. i go out of my way to avoid getting sick. and generally im pretty good at it. have gone years and years without catching a single bug. but leave it to a college campus, a cesspit of shit, to finally get me.  
 whats most upsetting is that i cant get any food today. i had my last can of soup way earlier, well… only half. rationing the other half for tomorrow. and i can tell that the lack of food is only making me feel worse. ive gotten progressively more sick as they day goes on. i spent most of the day in bed because even being upright in a chair was a bit exhausting. now i can barely move my body. my temperature is fluctuating wildly. i feel like i wasted my entire day. well. actually. i did. i still have to get my ass downstairs to water a few plants. im just so tired. i just wish i was smarter about the last few years of my life so i wouldnt be in this position. but alas. here i am. dealin with it.  
 i keep trying to tell myself that hunger is only a temporary feeling, and it comes in waves. but man, these waves almost have me on my ass. im so sick of fighting againsg nausea. worst feeling in the world. if my teeth werent fucked id be initiating my own vomit as to make myself feel better faster, and just get it out, but its futile.  theres nothing to even bring up.  
 chills. sweats. nausea. chills. sweats. nausea. just riding these waves. there goes my entire week. frustrated with a lot of things right now but ive done so much typing today that i just need to stop. elaborating isnt going to solve anything. i just need to get my plants taken care of and not pass the fuck out and ill be okay. cant wait for the day that im financially stable and can afford to have food in my house at all times. sick of having to sacrifice my own nutrition. i dont mind putting my animals first and feeding them first, that doesnt bother me. i will ALWAYS find a way to feed my animals and make sure they have their medicine until the bittetsweet end. but its disheartening not being able to eat because bills come first. if i keep going like this ill die and i wont be able to pay my bills or take care of my animals.  probably gonna go weigh myself on the way to the garden since the scale is down there. out of morbid curiosity. probably gonna be disappointed. always am. i can tell ive lost again. which is unsettling.  it sucks not being happy with your body no matter what you weigh.  lbs, im unhappy because i feel too skinny and weak and my brain functioning starts getting inhibited. doesnt feel good.  lbs, and im unhappy because i feel too squishy and slow. it takes a lot of fucking food to even get to that point, which makes me feel gluttonous n awful because i loathe the feeling of food digesting especially lots of it at once. i tell myself weight gain is what i want, and then ultimately it just doesnt feel right. and then everything else in between, i still feel unsettled in my own skin. ill tell myself i need to gain, and then i do, and i hate it. so ill lose, and ill hate that too. theres no winning. i wish proanas ( even the ones who dont realize they are ) would shut the fuck up and listen to what i have to say for once. i wish people understood that they dont actually want this. what you see on the surface of skinny, is not the reality behind skinny. literally i would give anything just to be a healthy weight and not have to agonize so hard over this. but the people who need to hear that, absolutely will not listen lmao.

Doc ID: 8001, distribution: 0.967789888381958 ; refeeding. in the eating disorder space, it's rarely touched on yet common in most recoveries. but what is it?
.
every recovery is different. personally, my recovery was from a restrictive battle with food. i had lost nearly half my body weight, and this time called for restoring weight. a lot of it.
.
when i finally began to eat again, i was afraid that the self-control i had cultivated over  four years would be “ruined”. that i wouldn't be able to compose myself when faced with a full plate. for too long, eating was an all or nothing task, and now that it couldn't be nothing, it had to be all.
.
i've been asked if i experienced “binge eating” in recovery, and here's where refeeding comes in. when the body is deprived of food for a long time and then food is reintroduced, it gets…excited. my body wanted to make up for all of those starving days and grumbling nights. .
for years i had tinkered with my body's natural messages. part of my recovery was relearning hunger cues. after awhile, they had disappeared, and now that i was calling them back home, they had to readjust. and they weren't exactly accurate. .
this isn't unhealthy. there is a learning period that comes with recovery, and feeling hungry even after a dense meal is not WRONG. your body learning its hunger cues is like you learning to do a math problem. both take practice and there will be errors along the way. but eventually, things begin to click.
.
when i was refeeding, i would eat large meals and feel hunger ten minutes later. i would grow frustrated with myself, angry for not being “normal”, scared that i was eating “too much”. i remember trying to rationalize with my body. “you can't possibly be hungry you JUST ate”.
.
what would i do? i would eat more, because my body was asking for it. the entire time i was miserable, confused, to be so full and yet so hungry. but i ate, because i had to show up for my body, had to allow it to fall before it could stand.
.
all of that just to say that recovery is a learning process. there is no correct way to recover. your body was subject to trauma, and now it needs to find its way back home. it's during times of discomfort that we grow the most 💫

Doc ID: 9550, distribution: 0.9562283754348755 ; you don't need to justify your weight gain to anyone (including yourself), and the only thing weight gain really means is that you've gained weight. that's it.

weight gain doesn't mean you need to change how you eat.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less beautiful.

weight gain doesn't mean you've “lost yourself”.

weight gain doesn't mean you're less healthy.

weight gain doesn't mean you can't still rock your favorite outfit.

weight gain doesn't mean you should be less confident.

weight gain doesn't mean you're any less worthy.

weight gain doesn't mean ANYTHING about the wonderful human you are.

weight gain really doesn't have any inherent meaning, and it's important to remember that our bodies are MEANT to change throughout the course of our lives. even if you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, your actions, how you feel, and your quality of life matter a whole lot more than your weight does.

recently, i've gained weight, and you know what? i'm cool with that. i know it can feel a lot easier to know and be told than to truly believe, but you deserve to love yourself and accept yourself no matter how your body changes.

your body is the vessel to your soul. it WILL change, but your worth never will.

Doc ID: 9762, distribution: 0.9556497931480408 ; i'm not anti-weight loss. in fact, weight loss was a part of my journey with developing a healthier relationship with food.

i don't talk about my weight loss much because weight loss is praised and weight gain is demonized so often in society when the truth is that neither is “better” than the other, and i know i live in a privileged body.  weight loss was an effect of developing healthy habits for me, but so was weight gain at a different point in my journey. weight loss was also an effect of my disordered eating and so was weight gain at a different point.

moral of the story: between weight loss and weight gain, one is not superior to the other and neither can tell you about someone's health.

i choose to advocate for weight gain being a perfectly okay thing because society puts weight loss up on a pedestal, and fat phobia and diet culture are things we have to overcome in order to become weight neutral.

reminders: health is not a look or a size, your worth doesn't dependent on your weight, and you are so much more than a body.

Doc ID: 9512, distribution: 0.9555040597915649 ; i couldn't stop binge eating until i stopped pursuing weight loss. 

now read that again.

in our society, binge eating is often demonized and weight loss is often congratulated, so it made sense to me that in order to stop binge eating, the answer was to restrict, to try and “control” my binges, and to lose weight. i thought if i just had enough self control, the binge-restrict cycle would end.

what i didn't realize was that:

binge eating is often perpetuated by restriction,
the illusion of control actually made me more out of control,
and i couldn't simultaneously try to manipulate my body and heal my binge eating.

giving myself unconditional permission to eat, letting go of the idea of “perfect eating”, and ending the pursuit of a certain body were crucial steps (along with a lot of inner work) in my healing.

WEIGHT LOSS ≠ HEALTH, and a healthy unrestricted body will find its healthy weight, but what that looks like may not look how you wish it did.

you have to ask yourself,

what's more valuable to you? the ability to live life without a caveat and with the opportunity to pursue true health (if you want to)? or the pursuit of thinness?

i promise you that freedom, not just food freedom but LIFE freedom, is worth it.

Doc ID: 2455, distribution: 0.9512144327163696 ; Reminders that have helped me eat more mindfully, flexibly & without guilt 👇

🥯 Food gives your body the energy to dance, lift heavy things, heal injuries, fight viruses, stand on your own two feet, to read, think, breathe & be.

🍪 Yes, food is fuel & it's important to give your body good quality food, but it's also for enjoyment too.

🌮 You haven't “ruined” anything by giving into your cravings. In fact, honouring your cravings when you have them will likely help you eat it in moderation & not get to a point where you're obsessing over it & overindulging later. 

🍕 Just because food is there doesn't mean you have to eat it all. If you're getting full, you can have a few cookies & put the rest in the pantry, or if you're eating out, ask for a take-away container. Remembering there's no urgency or wastage helps reduce the FOMO which causes a lot of us to keep going until we finish it all.

🍔 The human body is amazing, it's constantly responding to what you put into it, including your thoughts! I'd argue that feeling extreme guilt after eating a burger will likely do more harm to your mental health than that burger could actually do to your physical health. 

🧘🏻‍♀️ Try eating more mindfully, not mindlessly. To me, eating mindfully is acknowledging my hunger, listening to it, enjoying what I eat & then also listening to the fullness cues that my body sends me when I've had enough.

🥂 Just because you've eaten a less nutritious meal doesn't mean you have an unhealthy diet. “Your dosage is your poison” AKA having too much of anything probably isn't great, but finding that right balance of what works for you & makes you feel good is key!

🍌 Eating too little can cause you to feel tired, down, lack motivation & cause your metabolism to adapt/slow down. It's so important to eat ENOUGH, so that you can function optimally!

🥒 Your body IS going to fluctuate & change over the years. It's inevitable. So be kind to yourself. If you want to make changes, fine! But please don't risk your health for a physical appearance. It's your home & the only one you'll have. Treat it well 💖

Doc ID: 8922, distribution: 0.9504908919334412 ; is it possible to start intuitive eating without gaining weight? let's dive into it!

Intuitive Eating is a self-care eating framework, which brings together instinct, emotion, and rational thought. 

Unlike diets, it doesn't guarantee weight loss/gain 

We all have unique set points- a preset weight baseline wired to our DNA. 

Just like we all have unique foot sizes and shapes, we all have unique waist sizes and weights. 

The first step to intuitive eating is actually to reject the Diet Mentality. this step requires that any goals of weight loss be put on the back burner or eliminated right away because the motivation to lose weight can interfere with the process. imagine you are trying to reject the diet mentality but so focused on losing weight that anything which ~isn't~ a diet doesn't seem feasible for you.

focusing on weight loss also gets in the way of finally making peace with foods that you find yourself restricting and then binging later after your efforts to never eat carbs again goes to 💩

a part of Making Peace with Food for many (including myself) is weight gain, because they are finally eating what they've restricted for so long. eventually they get over the allure and realize it doesn't feel so great to eat a whole cake all the time.

in order to GET to that step and to feel like you are finally not controlled by your "cravings," however, you HAVE to let go of wanting to lose weight.

the good news is: along the way you learn how to Respect your Hunger & Fullness, Cope w/ Emotions Without Food, and incorporate movement you truly enjoy

Many actually end up effortlessly losing weight after the gain because they find they actually don't want to eat that whole chocolate cake every night and it was the “rules” that made it seem so enticing.

Some might gain weight & keep it - mostly because they were trying so hard to maintain a shape that wasn't meant for them. 

Intuitive Eating teaches that it wouldn't be fair to ourselves and our quality of life to try to fit a certain shape- just like it wouldn't be fair to try squeezing on a pair of size  shoes as a person with size  feet.

you won't have to follow anyone else's plan but your own ;) 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9750, distribution: 0.9487711787223816 ; contrary to popular belief, i strongly believe that binge eating disorder is also a disorder of restriction.

based on my personal experience, other people's testimonies, and the research literature analysis that i've done, frequent binge eating is very often a result of restriction, and it's essentially your body's survival tactic. if your body thinks that it's starving or going to starve, and there's food available everywhere around you it's going to instinctively want to eat everything (think: at the beginning of quarantine when everyone excessively stocked up in fear). it's not a lack of willpower, but rather, your body trying to help you. when guilt followed by restriction (even if it's mental restriction) occurs after a binge, this can cause a repeated cycle to occur. breaking out of this cycle isn't a matter of willpower around food, but rather a matter of breaking the restriction that leads to the binge eating.

i think there's a lot of stigma around binge eating-  according to @neda, binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder, yet in the recovery community on this platform, it seems to be the least talked about.  all disordered eating struggles are valid, and if you are struggling with binge eating, let me tell you that binge eating in and of itself is NOT a bad thing, so you don't deserve to let the fear, guilt, and anxiety of binge eating consume parts of your life.

give yourself permission to let go and move forward after a binge, be the supportive and empathetic friend to yourself that you have the power to be, and if you binge again, it doesn't mean you've failed, so keep going. the goal isn't to never over eat again, to even never binge eat again, or to control the way you eat at all because the more distant i get from my ED, the more i realize that the goal has never been about what or how i eat. the goal is to not let your eating control you, so that you can live your life to its fullest.

Doc ID: 12644, distribution: 0.9452685713768005 ; I am still afraid of some foods because, even though i need to, i am afraid of gaining weight.
 
 Tw! Weight talk I am afraid of gaining weight because of various reasons, but mostly because it will be seen by my brain as lack of control, but i know i need to and i fight against this mentality daily because: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

 NOTHING  WRONG WITH GAINING WEIGHT, no problemo at all, but some days, like today, it feels like there is and i get nervous and anxious about a future body where i weight  kilos more.  Days like these are really draining honestly, there's a pit in my stomach because i feel bad with myself because i only ate junk food or a thing with “way to many calories” and i have to constantly remind myself that:
a) IT DOESN´T MATTER, i am fine, i need those foods, i like those foods, therefore i eat them. 
b) The thought “one won't hurt” “this thing won't make me gain x kilos” is completely dumb. What if that item of food did make me gain a whole ten kilos? What about it? What's so wrong with it? 

I write it with no problem but accepting it is very hard, today i did well, i ate against my ed, but when a day like today hits where the more i eat the more anxious and self conscious i feel, i tend to avoid certain foods which is NOT OKAY, OKAY ME? There was a time in my life where eating junk food was another walk in the park, i miss those days and i want them back, so i have to continue with positive reaffirmations that i am valid and fine even after i ate those high caloric foods. 

At the end of the day, today was just a bad day, with really big victories!, but a bad day still, and like i said in a previous post i can't get mad at myself because recovery isn't linear and i am allowed to not feel my best all of the time. These feelings of self consciousness after eating “bad” food won't go away today, but if i reassure myself tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that, maybe they will :)

 so i kinda am purging more regularly again and it's fucking with my body, but i can't seem to be able to stop. it sucks and i'm trying this other one is ……. okay so. no, i do not want to have my health or lack thereof as a personality trait. sure it's important to get a proper nutrition, including healthy grains and proteins and fats, at the same time “joy” foods are totally fine to have. that's settled and alright. my no. issue is, though, the morality. yes, i want to be able to order a pizza and not feel guilty, but no, i do not agree with the way animals are treated in the places they get meat and cheese from. see, i don't want to restrict my body's cravings or be antisocial, but i morally absolutely am not okay with it. on top of that junk food tends to leave me feeling sick and bad, my body is not used to it and it is not considered healthy indeed, so do i still have to occasionally make myself eat it for recovery purposes? same goes for, like, chocolate. i sometimes crave it, but the actual taste always disappoints me, and sugary things give me a headache and fatigue very soon. so should i cut them out again, mostly? they never satisfy me and i feel truly bad about eating non-fairtrade chocolate! so, “health”. it certainly is fine to indulge in fun foods, not every meal needs to be % nutrient stuffed and healthy. whenever i eat junk food or sugary stuff though, i get disappointed by the taste and feel physically bad afterwards. my body is just not used to it, but it really is not considered healthy. should i listen my first cravings anyway, despite always realizing that “ew i kinda don't want that” after some seconds? or is it my ED speaking? it's all so confusing. even pre ED times, i for example was very disgusted by McDonald's. as a considerably small child (?) i stood in front of it for around  minutes, freezing, while my family was inside and having a meal. i hated their food and the scent in there, it made me feel so bad that i refused to enter  i always liked nuts as snack food, while rather disliking chips or flips, and gummy candies always made me feel sick, although i used to eat small amounts of them, while now the idea makes my stomach turn again. it feels like i am only craving these things because my ED makes them feel “forbidden”, while actually i really do not want or need them. what to do? same with soda, i actually wholeheartedly prefer water or juice, but without bubbles and nothing too sweet or it will make me even thirstier “eat what you loved as a child”, yes, i can still eat olives straight from the glass and corn in huge amounts. i don't want to restrict fast food or sweets, but they make me feel so sick. at the same time i often feel guilty and get rid of them, but not always. it feels like i am wasting meals and money on things i don't even want to put into my body, and everyone says it is unhealthy, and i never liked it, and it feels morally wrong to support these manipulative people. eurgh but i want to heal, i want to be guilt free. do i have to? i certainly have to sleep for  hours now, until i have to get up

Doc ID: 2684, distribution: 0.9438750147819519 ; Sorry to break it to you but YOU CAN'T HATE YOUR BODY INTO A SHAPE YOU WILL LOVE... 😦

I spent most of my life abusing my body with unloving thoughts & fad diets (& I know I'm not the only one), so I feel like it's important to share some of the things that finally helped me change my mindset & lifestyle FOR GOOD! ⤵️

- you can't hate your body into a shape you will love, showing some love to the body you're in is much more effective
- exercise in ways you enjoy and because you CAN (what a blessing), not because you 'have to'!
- if your goal is weight loss, learn about calorie deficits... To lose weight you must consume less calories than you burn each day. This means you can still eat the foods you enjoy so long as you remain in a calorie deficit
- fuel your body with nutritious foods & allow yourself to enjoy a meal you crave every day. Remember, this needs to be sustainable!!! So going cold turkey & cutting out your fav foods will never work long-term. If you still enjoy a treat each day, you won't feel like you're missing out, feel guilty about it or be tempted to throw in the towel & binge
- remember that it won't happen overnight, but it WILL happen so long as you keep at it 🌟
- one 'bad' meal doesn't mean you have to have a bad day... 
- eating too little can actually slow your metabolism, stall weight loss & harm your health long-term... Please eat enough 💛
- it takes an excess of , calories ON TOP OF the calories your body burns each day for you to gain a kilo... So no, over-eating on one day won't make you gain weight! But over-eating consistently will. 
- rest is just as important for success, your body needs time to recover! It goes through a lot every day just to keep you alive 🌟
- the scales are fickle & unpredictable, the numbers will change day-to-day due to your hormones, if your muscles are inflamed, if you're dehydrated, if you've eaten a lot of sodium, etc so please don't let this determine how you feel about yourself! 

I hope this helps in some way?! Lmk if it does! No matter what your health goals are... You've got this! 🥰

 beckelstein: 

 I find it odd how the fandom focuses so much on Aang's childhood being ruined when he learned he was the Avatar at , but there's very little talk about how discovering she was the Avatar as a toddler affected Korra's life and how she was raised. But we'll circle back to that… Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters – That is the Child Prodigy.  We'll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).  All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let's be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.  And that become a problem for one asshole in particular…  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai's maniacal ego couldn't handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn't the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this…  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering  of the  Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).  Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.  Aang/Sokka/Katara's story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.  Now, let's talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.   Yes, of course I'm talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph's family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka's arm in environment where her bending couldn't help her “see”.  Toph's story is a foil to Azula's, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph's story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.         Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we'll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara's potential and Sokka's genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many  yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka's character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season. Not to mention that because he wasn't a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can't be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations' actions.  Toph's anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn't as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.  While Toph's talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka's wasn't acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you're thinking. Zuko wasn't a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn't catch up with Azula's until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).  Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It's possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).  As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another's talent it's quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.  This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko's early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy's cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  “Azula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born”  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we've covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It's well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We'll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.  When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras' and other Avatars' lives.  . She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other  elements, buy also many things about the  other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naiveté about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. .  She was trained and mastered  of the elements by the time she was . Most Avatars don't know they have this power until they reach  and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra's natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang's, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep. she lacked restraint. I'm not saying her bending isn't great, but rather because it is so great it's her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naiveté of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.   Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through  seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend  elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?  It's a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.   Unlike Toph's parents, Iroh worried over Zuko's well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn't want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn't a prodigy like his sister.  And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.

Doc ID: 7283, distribution: 0.872596263885498 ; it's no secret that i read…a lot. if i didn't grow up an athlete i'd definitely say reading is my favorite sport. these past few months of stillness have been a blessing for my reading practice. i'm growing as both a reader and a writer! that being said, i wanted to share some of my book recs based on the type of reader you consider yourself to be in the current moment.

if you're just getting started: A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman is a great jumping off point if you haven't hit the pages in some time. it's relatively short with an easy-to-follow plotline. this is a very feel-good story! the author writes with simplicity yet so illustriously. 
**honorable mention: Turtles All the Way Down by John Green

if you need a thrilling plot: The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. you won't put this down. it's twisted and intriguing, with a remarkable plot twist at the end. this story follows two different character perspectives, so it requires more attention than a single-character plotline, but there isn't too much complexity to the craft here, which makes it less intimidating to read!
**honorable mention: The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah

if you're craft-crazy: All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. if you read and write often, the craft here will leave you breathless. there are so many intricate details that weave together in this piece that will bring you to a standstill. i read this months ago, and can still recite lines that left me speechless.
**honorable mention: City of Thieves and The th Hour both by David Benioff

if you're up for a challenge: The Secret History by Donna Tartt. this read is around  pages, but don't let it intimidate you. tartt is sophisticated and captivating, with characters development being a strong feature. this book calls for a highly attentive reader; there are plenty of subtle details that you may miss if you're not helplessly immersed in the story (which, i promise, you will be). i wish i could read both of her novels again for the first time. 
**honorable mention: The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt

one year ago today, I held my “yoga teacher” certification at the closing ceremony of my yoga teacher training in India. i went there after i graduated university and one of the most magical experiences of my life. it was transformative. it was eye opening. i had no idea how things would unravel but i'm really happy to see what followed this chapter.

fast forward to today: i work as a clinical dietitian (and actually love it), i'm doing yoga everyday, I went to india again actually, i'm teaching ashtanga-the practice that got me hooked. i'm reaching out to my friends more and im minding my mental health more than ever. i'm trying to sleep more

I thought I would share a few things that are integral to yoga, starting with the  limbs. The  limbs of yoga  are the bread and (vegan) butter to the teachings of yoga. They are steps that act as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. They serve as a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline. They direct attention to one's health and help us to acknowledge the more spiritual aspects of ourselves.

Notice how asana, or postures, is only one of the . Yoga is truly a lifestyle that encompasses mindfulness and love for others and the self. Read more about it in Patanjali's “Yoga Sutra”! That's one of the books that are required in most yoga teacher training courses. 

Of course, I am just a baby in my yoga life so if you want to learn the true teachings of yoga (aka not just doing cool postures), my personal favorites for yoga wisdom are @larugayoga and @kinoyoga.

I'll be sharing more yoga infographics this month but we shall just start with this one :)

🌅i currently reside outside of LA. last year Luke and i moved in with my parents to save up and to spend time with / around them. now that i've cultivated many tools, this has been so healing for my inner child 

🎨favorite color? don't know her. i tend to choose based on what “feels good at the moment”

🧘🏽‍♀️although i don't actively teach yoga right now, i am % sure my  hours of teacher training in Rishikesh were some of the most important ones of my life

🩺 one of the scariest things i did in my life was publicly pivot my path from studying Conventional Medicine to studying Āyurvedic, then to full time coaching & spiritual healing 📿 in doing this, i learned that our purpose manifests in so many ways… a joy of living is that we can enjoy each way. 

instead of thinking i've missed out on “the right path,” i now know that the one im on right now IS right.

As cheesy and overused as this quote is, it's the only thing that kept coming into my mind as the taxi was driving us away from the yoga school to the airport. My home for a month. Where strangers became family. Where practicing postures barely scratched the surface of the true meaning of yoga. Where I fell in love with my self again and again in each breath and stretch. I told myself I wasn't allowed to be sad until I left so I can enjoy the moment but my sadness from leaving pales to the gratitude I have for this wonderful time and the excitement I have for each person I met. I am much more happy that we all got to experience this together and I can't wait to see what light you beautiful souls spread throughout your life. You will touch lives you didn't even know you existed, and that makes my heart leap. Remember this experience but also live in the present moment because this is what is real right now.

where i learned that the physical yoga practice is a vessel for mental strength practice
that going % is not always better than going %
that happiness is not in an achievement but it just is
that the breath can always take you wherever you need to be

i went to Rishikesh after i graduated in  as a little gift to myself and loved it so much i went for advanced training at the same school  months after.  i didn't (and still don't) mean to become a teacher right away- i just wanted to learn about yoga a little bit deeper than i've been exposed to. i still have a lot of learning to do, but what i've learned has been slowly transforming me. 

i was just thinking about this time after a friend and i (that i met all the way across the world at my YTT) caught up and shared laughs and good bites. she and her boyfriend were in the room next to me, were both from california, vegan, and were both going into medical school afterwards. now we hang out in each other's living rooms and she talks about her real baby and i talk about my fur baby.

connections and events like that prove to me that life is more than random coincidences…

and if it ends up being coincidences at the end of it- at least i enjoyed it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 💕

Doc ID: 10975, distribution: 0.9908762574195862 ; Eating VEGAN in Thailand 🇹🇭🌱
-
Full what I eat in a day reels will be coming soon, but I just wanted to give you guys a flavour (😉) of how easy it is to find vegan food in Thailand!
-
QUARANTINE: We stayed in the Chillax Heritage quarantine approved hotel for one night and had  meals included in our full Test & Go package, which definitely exceeded expectations 👏🏻
-
FRUIT SHAKES: In the heat I crave one of these everyday and they're SO refreshing and so far my favourites are the banana, watermelon and coconut shakes!! You can also get smoothies here, although so far I haven't found a stall making them with non-dairy milk 🤨
-
FRUIT: You guys know how much I enjoy my fruit and so I loveeeee just walking around the markets to find what I fancy 😍 The mangoes here are definitely my favourite and I am yet to try durian still as it's in season, but to get the best deals you want to look for places selling really ripe fruit that they need to sell before it goes off 👌🏻
-
-ELEVEN: We need a moment to appreciate the -Elevens ok 🙌🏻😉 They're such good convenience stores and I've found everything from ฿ vegan meals they can microwave for you (although the one I tried was *incredibly* spicy 🥵) to cereal bars and cool vegan snacks! 
-
STREET FOOD: This has been where I've struggled the most with being vegan, especially with the language barrier, but I now know how to say my exact dietary requirements in Thai and this really helps!
-
DELIVERY: So far I've ordered food once as it was really late, and you can either use Food Panda or Grab here in certain areas of Thailand. This is also good because you can use card instead of cash💰
-
RESTAURANTS / CAFES: Most restaurants have vegan options, but just doing a bit of research and looking around can help you find the best places 🌱 My time in Pai was incredible, and I spent my day going to different vegan places for each of my meals (reel coming soon)!
-
COOKING CLASS: If you saw my last vlog then you'll know we did the half day evening class with Smile Organic Farm Cooking School and everything could be veganised which was amazing 🙈
-
I hope you're hungry now and definitely FOLLOW along for lots more content 💚✨ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 11171, distribution: 0.9839547872543335 ; So let's break the news: I have just under  weeks left here in Australia now and I am definitely starting to get quite emotional. Whilst @veganmutti sent me the cutest pictures of Bali ad Java the other day and the realities of being so far away from home suddenly came flooding back to me, there's just something so special about this place on the other side of the world that I simply love. It's the beaches, the sun, my (tiny) tan, the ocean, the wildlife … gahhhh there is literally so much that I'm going to miss.
-
It's also very likely that I'll be landing back in the UK and hit by full-on winter weather (because the seasons and climate, as we all probably know, are a bit screwed up). The temperature contrast will be pretty shocking and my tan will probably fade all too quickly. So after  months of building up a bit of a glow, it will be gone in just a few days I'm afraid, and that in itself makes me very very sad 😳😭
-
When I realised the other day that my first big solo adventure was coming to an end pretty soon, I was like this. is. it. I have to make the most of every last second I've got here, and ngl, I think I've done pretty well. Here in Byron Bay, I made a list of all my 'bucket list' activities and I've been ticking them off faster than the spread of coronavirus if I'm completely honest (a global pandemic we should not take lightly I know, but just a useful comparison, sorry I couldn't resist 🙃). And despite bad news the other day with one of my courses being cancelled, I've still managed to find a way to swim with the fish again 🐠 (all coming soon in the next vlog 😉).
-
Tomorrow, if all goes to plan, I'm attempting to eat out for all  meals as I've already mentioned. I'm pumped for some epic vegan food, but I do still have some decisions to make because there are waaaaaaaay way too may good eateries to try here in Byron. I'm spoilt for choice and drooling over every menu. The prices, well, I'm not a fan of, but the food is there to be enjoyed, right? 😝
-
And a final note. I'm still thinking about doing the meet up in Sydney, so it's not yet off the cards! I'll try and send updates as soon as possible ✌🏻

Doc ID: 10976, distribution: 0.9828349351882935 ; What's it like travelling with my brother?
-
First of all, we're only had one person recognise us as siblings . . . and it was in a club 😂 Everyone else, as I said before, thinks we're a “cute” couple OR twins!!! To be honest, I didn't think we looked that alike 🤨
-
Matthew and I are also very quickly learning a lot about each other 😅 I'm very chaotic in the moment, but I'm organised when I need to be and make sure we're on it with planning our new few days ahead. I have no patience when I'm on the hunt for food (#hanger lol) and Matthew basically pulls me across the busy roads here in Thailand 🇹🇭
-
Matthew, on the other hand, will spend ages getting his perfect scenic shots and definitely takes his sweet time getting ready (it's sometimes painful to watch 🤦🏻‍♀️). Hangry Holly and slow Matthew is not a good combination let me tell you that 😂 He'll video every single dog he sees because he loves them, and he now understands what happens when you drink too much alcohol in one night (if you saw the last vlog you'll know) 😬🍺
-
Until I travel solo again, I won't be able to judge why I haven't felt homesick this time. However, I definitely feel like having Matthew with me has meant I've felt safer and more comfortable doing things I wouldn't on my own, like going out after sunset for example, or CLUBBING 🙈 It's also really fun having him here to help get lots of pictures 😉 Matthew prefers me getting 'in the moment' shots for him, as a happy, smiley 'posed' shot is just not his vibe!!
-
This collection of photos was from our time in the Thai jungle, quite literally, and I'm currently working on this vlog for you guys because it was honestly hilarious and so much fun 🤩 #hollygoesduo

Doc ID: 10946, distribution: 0.9718583226203918 ; The best of 🇹🇭 Koh Lanta 🇹🇭 because yes, I'm still here talking about Thailand you guys . . . the chapter just hasn't officially closed yet ok 😅😉
-
You'll recognise some (or most) of this from my vlogs and other posts, but this island is really special to me ✨ It had incredible vegan food, including the best burger I've ever eaten in my liiiiiife, deserted windy roads to explore on scooters and it's where I kicked some 🍑 trying Muay Thai (😏), but this was definitely the hardest time for Math and I because we both got pretty ill.
-
However, I truly believe that it's during the lowest times when you really appreciate the beauty of travelling! I'm obviously not saying go and purposefully run yourself down, definitely not, but it's the most liberating feeling when you get through it and you're back ready to get yourself out there again 🙌🏻
-
As I've done in my other Thailand highlights, here are my top top recommendations for Koh Lanta (and if you haven't already downloaded my full itinerary, for FREE 😉 then it's linked in my travel planning video) 👌🏻
-
🇹🇭 For my foodies, please please please go to Fat Monkey and try the vegan burger, it's inCREDible, as well as Oasis Yoga Bungalows for French toast that can be made vegan and Happy Veggie for smoothie bowls 🍌
-
🇹🇭 We stayed at the Lanta Triple Novel and honestly, the family who run this place are so so nice 🥺 We also hired our scooters here and got a really good price as guests staying at this accommodation!
-
🇹🇭 Lanta Muay Thai Complex is where the sweat. is. at. you guys for Thai boxing!!! I did a private class but they also have group ones too 🥊
-
🇹🇭 You'll visit the incredible beach where I'm sat on the swing if you do the -island tour with The Longtail Charter and Tours! @matt.j.white also had a great time sleeping on the boat journey, so it's a very chill one 🙈

Get ready for some travel updates in today's video and I'm actually heading off this evening for my mini #hollygoessolo adventure 🤩 See you in a new country I guess 😏

Doc ID: 10953, distribution: 0.9711940288543701 ; ✨Curly Girl Method✨ UPDATES!!!
-
Now when I say my hair has been on a journey, wowwww you guys it seriously has!!! For the majority of my life I've scraped my hair back into a tight bun on the top of my head: the classic Holly bun 😏 Don't get me wrong, she reappears from time to time, but I've been following the Curly Girl Method pretty religiously for just over half a year now and it has transformed the health of my hair, literally 🙌🏻
-
So here's what I do currently and some of my best advice:
-
🌼 Brushing my hair dry is a massive no no!!! I only use a wide toothed comb in the shower and sometimes a @denmanbrush just before I add gel. I'm also not applying any heat to my hair at all, so no straightening or use of a hair dryer!
-
🌼 In Thailand I was using the new Curly Girl approved shampoo and conditioner bars from @ethiqueworld. Ngl I'm still getting used to the bars, but I will be using them permanently going forwards because they are pretty much zero waste and therefore a lot better than buying haircare products in bottles! 🌎
-
🌼 As I'm swimming at the moment, I wash my hair more frequently than I'm used to doing 🙈 I wear a swimming cap (we love the look and ofc with the goggles too 😏) and so I always wash my hair after this or I just rinse it really well when I'm pushed for time lol. This tends to be two or three times a week.
-
🌼 Every time my hair gets wet after my shower I'll style it with my gel from @sogooditsnoughty using the rake and scrunch method 👌🏻 I then plop for  hour using a big t-shirt and sleep with this t-shirt then covering my pillow to reduce frizz. On all other nights we're wearing the silk bonnet 😉
-
Going forwards, I want to try some different styling gels . . . or maybe an oil if that also works? So if you have any recommendations then please do share down below 🥰 My new haircare routine is obviously a big step-up from what I did before with my hair (basically nothing 😅) and it takes a bit more time, but it's part of my life now and I am honestly in love with my new found curls 💚
-
ps: getting em a polaroid for her birthday inspired me to take more pics using mine 😌 i have the @instaxhq Mini  😎

-
Travelling alone never fails to push me outside my comfort zone and it means I'm always trying something new. Edinburgh found me waking up in a dorm filled with only guys (*laugh tentatively*🙈😳), asking strangers to take a photo is always slightly awkward but kind of fun at the same time, and whilst it sounds really silly, I would have *never* ever bought myself a bagel out for lunch and enjoyed it by myself in the past!!
-
It's the small achievements like this that really make me realise how far I've come. Re-gaining my confidence has be incredibly challenging, but the one thing that blows my mind is that I seem to be finding it in the places where I would have once felt very lost. In a restaurant alone?! On a -hour overnight coach?! And yes, even on top of an extinct volcano (sounds funny, but it's so true) 😅😂
-
Tomorrow I'll be posting the second vlog from Edinburgh wooOoOOoo!!! And watch out for a reel sharing all the vegan food I found in the city whilst I was there (trust me it's going to make you hungry 😍)! I also decided to take on a big challenge on my final day in Scotland, which kind of went to plan . . . but it was also a very spontaneous adventure too 🤓 That's episode  👌🏻
-
Off topic but just to keep you guys in the loop: I graduate next week ahhhh omgggg 🎓 I then leave the UK officially for about a month for the next big #hollygoessolo trip!!! Flights are booked, I'm finalising the Balamory itinerary and I'll definitely need to brush up on a few skills before I leave 😉

-
️⃣ How easy was it to find vegan food? In short: very easy!! The city is huge and there are vegan options literally everywhere, but I'd say that the labels weren't as clear or obvious as they are in London, which I thought was quite interesting 🤨
-
️⃣ What was the best thing I ate in LA? This is such a tough question, but it probably has to be the selection of food (savoury and sweet) we got from @wholefoods 😉 I was literally in heaven you guys 😍🤩 . . . but @chipotle was a close second 🥑
-
️⃣ How expensive is it to buy food out? I'd say it's comparable to London, maybe a bit more expensive, but I've added prices to help you out! Angelo and I did do a lot of cooking in our AirBnB as well, although I definitely thought that the supermarkets were pricier for sure 🤓
-
️⃣ Are the portion sizes bigger? So you hear a lot about food portions being huge in America 😅 . . . but that really wasn't the case in LA. They all seemed pretty standard to me 🤷🏻‍♀️😉
-
️⃣ Is US Chipotle better than UK Chipotle? Angelo and I recently went to Chipotle in the UK, and so I'll be coming at you with my verdict on this very soon 😏

Doc ID: 11169, distribution: 0.9603143334388733 ; I was very proud of my black bean salad the other day, if I do say so myself, and I literally made it in like  minutes. It was also so cheap to make: plant foods definitely won't break your bank account, reduced food is even better, and I even found the salsa in the free food section of the hostel 😏 I'm such a stereotypical backpacker lol ... HOWEVER ... as you've probably already heard, I decided to film a full day of eating meals out. Definitely not something you want to be doing every day in Australia (you will break your bank account ok 😂) but it's been a super fun little challenge. Oh and the vegan food porn gets real guys 🤤
-
I'm currently sitting on a coach making myself very hungry right now thinking about all the good food I've had, but I also just wanted to remind you that the vegan bundle is back! And you probably now only have less than  hours if you want to get them (affiliate link in my bio,

This time you get not just , but  eBooks and online classes for $, which would normally cost you over $ ‼️It's a % discount and some of them cost close to $ individually, so it's literally such a good deal.
-
Whether you're vegan already like myself and want to try new recipes, you've recently turned vegan and need some advice, or you're considering making some shifts towards a more plant-based lifestyle, you'll definitely find something useful in the bundle. The books are filled with recipes, workouts, zero waste living and self-care advice, info on sustainable living, minimalism etc etc etc ... basically a lot of content is what I'm trying to say.

Doc ID: 11178, distribution: 0.9595752954483032 ; Being vegan is seen by some as completely abnormal, and the same holds true for not drinking alcohol. Before anyone comes at me, I am definitely not trying to be judgmental of your life choices at. all. I just want to talk about things from my perspective, and be a voice for those who are often worried about not fitting in when most other people enjoy drinking alcohol.
-
Especially because I'm young, people assume I drink and they're pretty surprised to hear that I'm teetotal. In fact, a lady yesterday asked me if I find it hard to meet people (and I think she meant relationships stuff in particular 😂😬). This comment was pretty bewildering and kind of frustrating for me to hear, because she literally assumed I had no friends or social life because I choose not to drink.
-
Personally, yes I do only feel comfortable clubbing and staying out late partying with those who know me very well. They know how I act, and I know myself I'll have a good time with them. Now this isn't how everyone feels, but that's just me. And it's the reason why I haven't really explored the nightlife here in Australia.
-
If you've watched my latest vlog, you'll know that I got the closest to 'clubbing' (said in inverted commas because it was a very feeble attempt ladies and gentlemen) whilst camping on Fraser Island. I was pretty shattered in the evenings if I'm totally honest, and I'd had the best time singing in our x car anyway, swimming in the lakes and exploring during the daytimes.
-
So yes, whilst I'm not an avid nightlife gal, @dingosfraserisland (gifted tour) was an epic adventure thanks to the people I met, places we visited, and the crazy things that went down on the campsite (both during daylight hours and when it got dark 😂). There's even a mystery story in the vlog too if you watched it (which I still don't know the answer to yet, so I'm open to your conspiracy theories 😳)!

Basically to finish off my waffle of the day, I just want to say: goon or no goon (my Aussies only will get that one 😏), fun can always be had ✌🏻

-
This is something I will talk about in upcoming vlogs and I'll probably be doing more 'what I eat in a day' videos (similar to episode #), however I want to start the discussion here on insta.
-
Ok so let's talk about cooking for myself. This is super easy for me as I did it for  years at uni. I simply go to a local supermarket (Aldi, my fav, was very close by in Melbourne 👌🏻 but I'll be going to Coles a lot soon as well) or a market (I hands-down loved the Queen Victoria market in Melbourne 🙌🏻) and cook in the hostel. The kitchen in the Melbourne Metro @yhaaustralia was a bit chaotic at times, however I managed to find everything I needed ... eventually 😅
-
Now let's talk about tours. I've completed  altogether so far and it's generally been fine. Making sure you flag up your dietaries in advance is super important and something to do first. Then I think it just comes down to the tour and tour guide. Sometimes the food is set and you just have to make do with what's provided, but when on the Great Ocean Road for example, our tour guide, Guy, let me come and help him shop to make sure we bought something I'd enjoy. I was honestly super grateful for this!
-
Personally, I do eat a lot and I carry oats with me all the time because often I am still hungry after meals, especially before bed. So, as you guys probably already know, I just eat a tonne of oats to fill me up 😉 In general though: carry lots of snacks! This meal was my dinner yesterday: I ate  of these plates full of salad and some tofu. I wasn't very full afterwards therefore, surprise surprise, I ate a tonne of oats 😂
