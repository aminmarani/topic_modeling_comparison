It just shows your damaging content to people in the recovery tags actually trying to recovery. You help no one and hurt everyone. Be fucking mindful for once. Stop using those tags on shit that is pro ana, pro relapse, or triggering. Dont be a dick. Call out your ed palls who do the same. The recovery tags are swamped with pro content just because you think tagging thinspo as pro recovery will save you from being called out.

Doc ID: 2619, distribution: 0.8843172173624161 ; Are you afraid of eating higher calorie foods, untracked meals & weight gain? I used to be too... But let me explain why you shouldn't be 🙈

Firstly, I want you to ask yourself  questions... 
“What if I wake up in  years time a few kilos heavier than I am now?
Now ask yourself, “What if I wake up in  years time still terrified of food?” 
Which is worse? 🤔

Secondly, high calorie / untracked meals DON'T equal weight gain. Eating at a caloric surplus consistently = weight gain. So let's just get that outta the way! 💪🏼

Significant weight changes don't happen overnight. It takes eating an excess of , calories on top of the amount of calories your body burns to gain a mere .kg of body weight which is usually distributed across your entire body... So no you won't wake up kgs heavier after overeating for a day or two. In fact, you really won't notice a physical difference at all!

When you do overeat, you may notice some initial temporary changes such as bloating & puffiness, but this is the body's natural response to receiving extra energy & it will go away after a few days! So don't go into a frenzy where you start punishing your body, eating less & working out more... Just ride the wave & give your body some time! ✨

When you eat intuitively, it's normal for your physique & weight to fluctuate because you'll unintentionally overeat or under-eat sometimes, but so long as you're making healthy, balanced choices overall, it'll likely balance out in the end. If it doesn't & you end up seeing changes you're not % comfortable with, that's okay too!

Weight gain doesn't make you a failure, there's nothing wrong with fuelling & nourishing your body well! It doesn't happen overnight, just like weight loss doesn't happen overnight. So yes, you can tweak your eating habits slightly along the way to suit your goals, but there's so much more to life than counting calories & fearing weight gain. Trust your body & enjoy your life 💛

This information is what has helped me have a more flexible & realistic approach to health & nutrition, so I hope it helps you too 🥰

Doc ID: 3290, distribution: 0.9936363558522943 ; Therapy .. // endings  Things come up very randomly in therapy. I find this often. I have something to talk about, sometimes it needs several sessions to process it fully, and then somewhere in the middle of the sessions, something else happens that completely diverts me away from the topic. When I was asking T about supervision last week, she gave me an example of a client who would never leave sessions on time. “No matter how many  or  minutes warnings I gave her, she would just carry on talking.” After taking it to supervision, T said she eventually had to tell this client she couldn't keep working with her. The story niggled at me, because I quite frequently keep talking in session until T brings it to a close. She does give me a  minute warning, but unless she says at the end of that “ok Faith, time is up”, I too will just carry on.  This session I reminded T of what she'd said and I asked her if I do that, not finishing on time. “No Faith, you don't do that. I know we do often go over by  or  minutes -“ I interrupted her at that point because we very very rarely go  minutes over and I know that because the Skype call tells me the length of time we've been connected. “OK, yes, only a few times we have gone over by  minutes but we do usually go over by a few minutes, but I don't mind that. I think, therapy is a relationship and you can have a bit of flexibility there while still keeping the boundaries.” I said “Uh ok… I mean, I will just keep talking at the end of a session until you tell me to stop. I will stop when you say so, but if you don't say anything, I know I just keep going.” T smiled, like she knows that's exactly what I do. “But I know you see me as a person, Faith. This other client just saw me as an object.” I thought for a moment and said “So…uh… that's likely what I'm going to do when we come to ending therapy altogether. I'm just going to keep on going until you say we have to stop. It's what I did when you moved away, you had all these suggestions of things I could do to find other therapists, and I did nothing so in the end I carried on seeing you.” “Okayyyy…. so are you saying you want me to set a date for us to finish?” T asked. Omg no… slow down T! I'm not ready to go there. “No! I'm just telling you that if you're waiting for me to do it, I probably won't.” “What I'm thinking Faith, is that when we set a date, we'll have year from then to process our ending. I'm thinking we'll meet every week for the first six months, then fortnightly for three months, and then monthly for the last three months. That way you'll have time to gradually get used to less therapy.” I mean, that's all very well, but I hope she knows I'm not going to jump into that process voluntarily. If I set a date, I know I will be regretting it when the end comes. I can't believe I'll feel ready to stop therapy. I need T in my life. We haven't really talked about what contact between us, if any, will look like after therapy is ended. I just…. I'm just not ready to be without her.

Doc ID: 4125, distribution: 0.986414441222795 ; Therapy .. // screenshot  // avoidant attachment   T gets her phone and I send her the first screenshot. She starts to read it and I sit there a bit awkwardly while she does so. “Avoidant attachment…. yes, yes I see that in you…”. She carries on reading. “Hmm yes, I see why you related to what this said. The description of the parents…. How did it feel to read that?” I struggled to explain. I said that it felt weird, it was weird to find myself in a book. T tried to reflect back to me, but what she said didn't really resonate. So I tried again. It's kind of proof… not that I think you were making it up…. but that you weren't just being nice… like it's there in a book too, almost an exact description of me and my situation and how it came about. We were just about out of time to think about it any further, and T asked how it had felt to talk about the attachment stuff. That's when I told her that ultimately I think I just want to know how to fix it, and she smiled and said she thought that we were probably a bit short on time to get into that now. I pointed out we had  seconds of the session left and she laughed and said “ok attachment theory in  seconds, come on T, get on with it!”. She started to say something, I think like a short point about attachment, but then she cut herself off and I guess decided it would be wiser not to say anything. She told me to send her the other two screenshots for next week and we would look at them then. Then we scheduled for next week and said goodbye.

Doc ID: 3312, distribution: 0.9804726691470927 ; Therapy .. // Supervision  “Can I ask you a question?” I ask T for permission to do stuff a lot. Can I ask you a question? Can I tell you something? Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

Doc ID: 4845, distribution: 0.9786385480756086 ; Therapy //  I told T I had something else to ask her, but it was difficult. “Try me” she said I was silent for some time trying to form the sentences in my head. “I can't get the words in the right order.”  “Mmm just try saying some of the words and we'll figure it out” Eventually I managed to say to her that when she goes off-script and says a load of things I wasn't anticipating her to (in my head I said “when you say a load of whacky things” but I thought that was a bit disrespectful so I didn't say it out loud), when she does that it makes me wonder if she is muddling me up with her daughter and saying things to me that she wants to say to her. T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

Doc ID: 4041, distribution: 0.9767174852588965 ; Question: Hiya, I was interested in your advice- I have a therapist that I really like, but we just don't see eye to eye on one particular issue. I've been feeling this way for ages but I'm too scared to bring it up in session. Now I'm not seeing her this week and naturally this problem is all I can think about. The worst part of me just wants to give up and run away and just ghost her but I feel like I should face the problem head on?? Would it be bad to text her about it now? Sorry-feel free to ignore Answer: Hi anon,I don't know what your therapists rules on texting are so I can't know how she'd respond if you texted her. Also if it's an issue that you know you don't see eye to eye on, then it's really best discussed in a therapy session rather than by text, so you don't end up misunderstanding each other or not being able to clarify or hear a tone of voice or facial expression that might soften the words.Maybe you could text her and say you've been thinking a lot about X and could you discuss it next session? That way it puts it on the agenda but keeps the conversation for the therapy room. The fact that you're thinking about it a lot this week probably means it's an important topic for you to discuss. You could even talk around it in session for a while, saying you have something to talk about but you're worried, you know don't see eye to eye about it, you're really scared to bring it up, it makes you just want to run away and not come to therapy anymore. That helps your therapist understand what an important thing it is for you.When I've approached stuff that way with my T, she reminds me that we've talked about hard stuff before, that she hasn't got upset about certain topics, that she has been really happy that I've felt safe enough to bring these things up, proud that I've been brave enough to say them etc etc. That helps me build up the courage to bring up the difficult thing.Hope that helps anon x

Doc ID: 2394, distribution: 0.9749320532182977 ; Therapy .. // insensitive timing  I told T that I thought I needed to carry on talking about it. “This week's been a bit difficult…. because last session, I had things I wanted to talk about… uh, things I'd been holding all week… and then I didn't get chance to talk about them because we went off talking about what you wanted to talk about.” I actually thought that T was going to tell me that it was my session and I can choose to talk about what I want, and I was all set to tell her that was unfair and like pushing someone off a cliff and then telling them while they're falling that they can still choose to go a different way if they want. Anyway, she didn't say that so I didn't have to use my defensive analogy! What happened was T had a kind of aha moment and it was like she suddenly had clarity about what had gone on last week. She said oh yes! she remembered now, she had a lot going on that week and her head was a bit all over the place. She could see now that her timing was a bit insensitive and she remembered that I had messaged her about my mum's facebook post and then I hadn't had chance to talk about it. She apologised. She said it wouldn't be fair for her to have told me what was going on for her but it had been a difficult week and because of that she had unintentionally been a bit insensitive, and she was sorry. T talked about it being a relationship and her being a real person and not perfect, and that was good for her to model because it showed me that everyone has struggles and nobody is perfect. She referenced how we can have a tendency to idealise our therapists (haha yes she totally knows I do that). She said if she never got anything wrong then I would think it was never ok for me to make mistakes. I understand what she's saying but it also seems to me like this is the ultimate therapist cop out!! It's good to not get things wrong but it's also good to get things wrong 🤔🤯 hence…. the therapist is always right?? 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4591, distribution: 0.9746212592487036 ; I had therapy this morning and it felt like a very bland session. It didn't feel worth the session fee (although of course I will still pay it). The session ended and I wondered what we actually achieved. Last week we talked about my childhood, and as we ended, T said “we probably need to spend a bit more time thinking about this”. So I was all willing to talk about it some more this week but it's hard to open it all up again and it feels like we never got back as deep as we were the first time.  I think I wanted her to respond in certain ways to things I said, and when she didn't, I felt dissatisfied and frustrated. I kept working hard but it just wasn't really happening in my brain this week. I couldn't find the words to explain thoughts or feelings, I couldn't gather my thoughts enough to get them into words I wanted to say. I tried to go with what was coming up in my brain, which meant we jumped around a bit. I think it did work to an extent because I did eventually stop thinking about how we weren't connecting and how we weren't really getting into anything properly…. and I suppose when you stop thinking about it that's often because it's started happening. Ahh anyway. I will try and think of some positives of the session in a minute. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 4795, distribution: 0.9725298983926267 ; Therapy .. // post-apologetic   I went into this session not knowing quite what I wanted to talk about. The worst of the rupture is over and I don't really feel mad at T anymore, just kind of sad that it all happened. I don't have lots left to say about it but I'm not sure I'm ready to jump in and be vulnerable in talking about something else.  T welcomes me and says “Where to today? I have the letter you wrote to your mum here, or we could talk some more about…. what we were talking about last week?” “I feel like I'm in a gap between those two things” “Ok, well…. can I tell you the thing that stood out to me the most from last session?” I nod. T flips a page in front of her. “You said that when I apologised, it made you feel uncomfortable. Can you say a bit more about that?” That's such a therapist thing to say. I sat thinking about apologies from the past. I wonder whether I want to dredge that all up. T asks me what I'm thinking about in the silence, and later says maybe the things I don't want to talk about are exactly the things we need to be talking about.  I talk a bit about apologies from my childhood. T says “So you felt like if you didn't accept my apology, I might leave you. Did you think I might not be here this session?” “Uh, I thought you would be here for the session, but I thought you might say you'd had enough of me or I was just being over dramatic and you didn't want to see me anymore or something.” “Did you feel like I was expecting you to be all ok about it after I apologised?” “Noooo. But I was worried that you would get impatient with me, that you wouldn't want to see me any more because I was too much effort.” “Hmm and did you feel that I felt like that?” “Well nooo you didn't say that. But you might have been thinking it.” We spent some time talking about how T felt when she apologised to me. She said again that she had done something wrong and so it was right that she took responsibility for that and apologised to me. That she was sad that she had made me feel the way she did.  I asked her again did she really not feel angry or impatient with me that I didn't just say ok everything's fine? “No, I definitely didn't. Hmm. Well let me think… I wasn't angry or impatient, but I was a bit… *acts out putting her head in her hands* ohhhh Faith's stopped eating again.” I hadn't “stopped eating”, but we were out of time to go into that. T wound up the session by saying that at first she wished that that whole session where we had the rupture hadn't happened, but now she is glad it happened because the processing of it has been healing for me. She said that I have had a new positive experience of an apology with no strings attached.

Doc ID: 3115, distribution: 0.9719170778430763 ; Therapy .. // do you want brutal honesty?  I turned up to this therapy session a little bit nervous but feeling like I had stuff to talk about. The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

Doc ID: 4335, distribution: 0.96959511478258 ; Talking about (shhh🤫) terminating therapy   As we were coming to the end of my therapy session yesterday, we were talking about what we might work on this year and T said that maybe also we needed to think about… that sooner or later T will want to retire and she knows I don't like to think about it but maybe we need to think about how we will eventually end.  I guessed what she was going to say before she even finished her sentence. I don't know why when she brings it up, it's always at the end of a session. It's risky because sometimes I find it really difficult to think about and we end up having a rupture and then no time in session left to repair it. I guess she doesn't want to push aside the stuff I'm bringing to session so she keeps her stuff for the end. As it happened, I had been thinking about ending at some point in the future at the end of last year. I'd been thinking that maybe this year would be the year. But I hadn't said it out loud to anyone. I've started to feel that with what we got to talking about at the end of , the biggest part of therapy processing is starting to be over. I kind of nodded in response to what T said, and after a pause I said “oh I was thinking… at the end of last year…” then I got overwhelmed and broke off and did that awkward sort of smile while looking down, that I do when I'm trying to say something but it's hard. T prompted me a bit and after a couple more false starts, I managed to say that I'd been wondering whether maybe this year would be the year I ended therapy. Then I added quickly “But now I've said it out loud, I don't want it any more.” T said “Ahhh…. okayyyy” in a really surprised curious kind of way, and then added “Maybe that's something we need to spend a bit more time thinking about”. I started to say something else but then I realised we were over time and I wanted to say it at a time when we could discuss it properly. So I broke off and said, oh I would save it for next time. I don't want to stop therapy. I don't want to stop seeing T. But also part of me thinks that I may be starting to be ready to do that even if I don't want it.

Doc ID: 6845, distribution: 0.9475216182456493 ; my favorite fall savory meal. so versatile, can be served hot or cold, and packs so much flavor 🍂

fall harvest kale salad

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
-  apples of choice, diced (i used envy apples)
-  can of chickpeas (oz), rinsed and drained
- / cup vegan feta cheese

maple djion vinaigrette:

-  tbsp dijon mustard
- - tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup      
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the vinaigrette over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water    
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

#ad #NakanoRiceVinegars 

whipped sweet potatoes with crispy chickpeas

serves 

sweet potatoes:
 medium sweet potatoes, peeled
 tbsp. non-dairy butter
 tbsp. full fat coconut milk
 tbsp. @nakanoflavors Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
a pinch of sea salt

crispy chickpeas:
 -oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
 tbsp. NAKANO Roasted Garlic Rice Vinegar
 tbsp. olive oil
a pinch of sea salt

start by preparing the sweet potatoes, puncture the sweet potatoes using a knife, then transfer to a microwave-safe dish filled with an inch of water. place the sweet potatoes in the bowl, cover with a paper towel, and microwave for  minutes (flipping halfway through). while the sweet potatoes are steaming, prepare the chickpeas. drizzle the chickpeas with the rice vinegar, oil and sea salt and mix until thoroughly combined. transfer to your air fryer basket and cook at ˚F for  minutes. while those are cooking, remove the potatoes from the microwave and mash with a fork. pour the butter, milk, vinegar, and salt over them and begin to whip using a hand mixer. this will take - minutes until the mixture is uniform and fluffy. transfer to a plating dish. remove the chickpeas from the air fryer and top the potatoes with them. feel free to add an extra pat of butter and a drizzle of the rice vinegar to finish.

🍂 apple walnut harvest bowl 🍂

recipe is pretty self-explanatory! but here's what you'll need:

- kale (or green of choice- massage with a few drizzles of olive oil to break down)
- chopped apples
- walnuts
- craisins 
- protein of choice (here i used pesto tofu, which is just extra firm tofu marinated in store-bought pesto overnight and then baked in the oven at f for  min)
- hummus dressing 

no measurements necessary! add as much of each ingredient as you'd desire and mix it all up :) if you're taking this on the go i recommend storing the dressing seperately and then adding when you're ready to eat! this salad is so flavorful and delicious— feel free to pair it with crackers, toast, or my favorite…. roasted sweet potatoes :)

-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

the white chocolate topping here is optional but let's be honest…is it really? lol

pumpkin pie protein bars

- / cup creamy salted peanut butter
-  scoops (or / cup) vanilla plant based protein powder
- / cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
-  tbsp oat flour
- pinch each of sea salt, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon

mix all of the ingredients together until a uniform dough forms that holds together well. if the batter is too loose, add another tbsp of oat flour (this might be because the protein powder you used absorbed more liquid). once you have the right consistency, transfer dough into parchment paper lined brownie tin. place in the freezer for an hour or two to set before enjoying. i poured melted white chocolate over mine at this point and placed in the freezer again to set before slicing. store in the fridge for up to a week or in the freezer for a month!

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

you're not asking for what's real, you're thinking about what life COULD feel like… which is a lot like playing and dreaming.

Let's keep dreaming & creating.

one of my favorite things about instagram is the ability to CONNECT with people who we share hobbies, passions, experiences, and struggles with so instantly.  something that is so so important to remember though is that even when we share something with someone else, it doesn't mean we share the exact same perspective on it because we are all such unique and multifaceted humans with different backgrounds, cultures, surroundings, lives, and truths that influence our perspectives, opinions, and personal experiences.
——
that being said, everyone you see on social media, whether you agree with what they post or not, is human and deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect. lately, i feel like there's been a lot more conflict, anger, judgement, calling people out, shaming, and overall lack of empathy here on instagram over differences in perspectives (we can't expect ourselves from other people!), and honestly, it breaks my heart to see.

we are all just imperfect humans doing our best to make it...so in a world where we can be anything, can we please just be kind?

my inner critic voice is loud today, but rather than letting it dictate my life and influence my actions, i'm choosing a new narrative to tell myself instead. gentle reminder that we are our biggest influence, and the way we speak to ourselves matters!

here are some affirmations that are working for me today and may be resonating with you too:

i am greater than the narrative my anxiety is creating in my head.

i matter, and i deserve to live a life of peace, joy, fulfillment, and love. i will let go of and separate myself from the things getting in the way of the life i deserve.

i am in control of how i show up, what i focus on, and how i respond.

i am enough. who i am is enough. what i do is enough. working on accepting and loving myself fully and unconditionally is how i take my power back.

- when you see yourself as amazing as you are, it's easier to see the beauty in others!

- you may use your work / service as a way to “earn” status & favor which can be really draining and may feel inauthentic

stop playing small. be yourself. you're amazing.

setting boundaries after years of sacrificing their peace and energy for the sake of others,

learning to honor their body after years of believing that their body couldn't be trusted,

trying to heal even when the healing hurts more than what they're healing from,

and doing their best to show up despite everything they've been through.

don't get me wrong—i love creating content. i love sharing my food, life, and thoughts on here. i love having a space where i feel safe to talk about my struggles and things i'm passionate about. i love interacting with this incredible community. i love feeling connected to you all.

as much as i love being here and am so grateful for each and every one of you who follow along and are a part of my life, in the current chapter of my life, i'm accepting that being on here in the same capacity i've been in the past isn't serving me in the same ways it used to. maybe you've already noticed some change in what and how often i've been posting, and maybe you haven't, but with big changes and moves happening in my life, the bulk of my time and energy has been needed to be focused elsewhere.

this doesn't mean that i'm leaving social media! it just means that this page, which honestly may not seem change that much to you, has a redefined purpose for me—to unapologetically share my life in ways that bring me joy and be a place where i don't feel obligated to come up with and pump out content when or be a “source of inspiration”.

if you need to hear it: it is okay to leave or take a break from something you love. it is okay for your priorities to change. your value is not determined by what or how much you do or create. how your life feels is more important than how it looks.

At first this series was about showing y'all just how much of a highlight reel Instagram usually is... You usually see an entire Instagram feed of the images on the left, but never the images on the right. So I'm here to remind you at the start of every week to not take yourself so seriously, to care less about the way people might view you & to remind you that we're all human — there are plenty of 'bad' photos behind the  really good one! 🙈

Next time you see that specific girl or guy online that you always aspire to look like & compare yourself too, picture them with any one of these faces or poses & I guarantee you'll feel better about yourself hehehe.

Happy Real Me Monday, except it's also a @baseline Seamless haul on the beach! 😍 | AD

If those reminders up there aren't enough: then remember that Aphrodite was well-known & adored as the GODDESS of BEAUTY and she had: rolls, lumps & fat on her body, just like the rest of us 🥰 the only thing she had that some of us don't is the CONFIDENCE. But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

NONE of these bodies are “better” or “worse” than the others.

some angles, my body looks differently than it does at others.
some days, i view my body differently than i do on others.
some pictures, my body looks different than it does in others.
some periods in life, my body is different than it is during others.

point is: NONE of that matters because your body has absolutely NOTHING to do with your worth, and ALL bodies are beautiful and incredible ones.
