Meet celebs or be able to travel anywhere?  Answer: Id like to travel anywhere. Theres a band i adore called Powerwolf and its on my bucket list to see them perform live. Except they NEVER come to my country so Id have to fly out to see em. That would be awesome. I also have a friend in another country I would love to visit. And of course just see what there is to see all around the world. Idk what i would do if i met a celeb. Unless they gave me money i dont see the point besides realize how boring they actually are. Im really into music so i consider my fav musicians as “celebs” and have met a few. Its cool in the moment to be starstruck but after the event its just not that fulfilling.

Doc ID: 2575.0, distribution: 0.48380597480106835 ; I always thought I had a slow metabolism (especially after I lost kgs) but really I just didn't understand my metabolism OR know how to increase it. So let's chat about how I “eat so much” now! 🍕🍌🥪

No, I'm not about to tell you to drink green tea or spend hours at the gym. Here are some *realistic* ways to increase your metabolic rate instead 👀

Simply put, metabolism is the chemical processes that go on inside your body to keep you alive, breathing, repairing cells, digesting food, etc. These chemical processes require energy AKA burn calories. The speed of your metabolism is influenced by  factors which are *pictured above* — swipe through the post!

So doing things to increase any of those factors will help you increase your overall metabolism! You have limited control over your Resting Metabolic Rate, but you CAN increase it via gaining muscle mass because muscle burns more energy at rest, increasing your metabolism.

What you do have more control over is the energy your body expends through your Thermic Effect of Food, Exercise & Non-Exercise Activity!

Tips to increase your Thermic Effect of Food output:
🥝 eat enough, eat frequently & have some protein in your meals — protein requires more energy to digest so your body burns more calories in order to break the food down.

Tips to increase your exercise output:
🏋🏻‍♀️ workout in ways you enjoy — squeezing in just a -min workout will increase your output/metabolism.

Tips to increase your Non-Exercise Activity output:
🤌 take the stairs instead of the elevator, do the chores, play with your kids, it's all the little things you do without realising!

P.s. you don't have to be constantly doing the things I've mentioned above. There are  hours in the week & I spend only . of those doing some form of intentional exercise, with  rest days! Outside of that, I'm pretty much on my butt working, haha! Sometimes I'll do some Non-Exercise Activity like: chores, play with the dog, scrub my tan off 😮‍💨 etc… A little goes a long way! 💪🏼

Doc ID: 2569.0, distribution: 0.4569023994061369 ; MY CURRENT WEEKLY GYM ROUTINE 🤍 [ad] 

You ask, I provide 😋 I figured I'd start creating posts for my most frequently asked questions - if you have any, leave them below!

After  years of health and fitness, I've finally been able to create a structure that is flexible, enjoyable, something I don't dread doing and one I believe I can maintain long-term. To me, my goals aren't crazy, they're realistic and achievable. My focus is no longer physique-based, but more on moving my body to feel strong and maintain my level of fitness. So this is just what works for me 💪🏼

What are your goals? And what's your favourite way to get your body moving? Let me know below! 🤩

My gym routine isn't just about the muscle groups I train, it also includes a few of my favourite supplements (along with a balanced diet) as well. If I ever want a lil energy boost, I use @macrmike tropical mixed berry or lychee berry pre-workout before I head to the gym, then I sip on the tropical mango plant-based aminos throughout each workout, these contain electrolytes, vitamins and aminos which are all important for muscle development, recovery and strength. I usually re-fuel with some vanilla buttercream protein oats afterwards. I like to stay nourished throughout the day with plenty of nutritious but delicious meals/snacks too! I've included an example in the post 🥰

You can shop the @macrmike performance, baking mixes, nut butters & protein range through the link in my bio & enjoy % off with my code: AMB-BREE xo

P.s. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm not a PT so my form may not be perfect and I'm not advising you guys that this is the best routine or way to workout, this is purely just to share what I do to maintain my goals and perhaps give you some inspiration for your own workout routine. Hope this helps! ⚡️

I don't know about you, but my 🧠 said “YES” straight away.

Of course I want to feel all of those things. I want to feel my best & look after my body, I only have one & it's my home 🏡 [@gymshark ad]

While there's no magic pill that will automatically give you all of those things, there IS something that you CAN control in order to feel all of these things….

✨EXERCISE✨

Not to change your body, not to punish yourself, but to nourish your body, to look after it inside & out.

THE BENEFITS: Physical activity releases feel-good chemicals in the body, it helps with mental clarity & brain health, improves your sleep, increases your energy levels, reduces the risk of disease, strengthens bones & muscles, improves your ability to do every day activities, and that's just to name a few!

We are so often sold exercise as a method to transform our bodies, but exercise shouldn't be punishment to look a certain way. 

It's an act of self love that will bring more reward internally than it ever could externally. Once I switched my approach to movement, I started to truly enjoy it & now I lead an active lifestyle with ZERO aesthetic goals. 

I challenge you to find movement that is sustainable for your lifestyle. Movement you enjoy. Whether that's walking, dancing, playing sport, pilates, lifting weights, running, cycling, stretching,  minutes per day or a couple of hours per week… Finding what works for you is key. Otherwise it won't last very long, and neither will your happiness!

I've been living a more active lifestyle for the past  years now, and while my relationship with movement has struggled along the way, I've finally realised that having a flexible, sustainable, positive relationship with exercise beats doing exercise you dread just because everyone tells you it's the “right way to exercise”. Listen to your body!!

Doc ID: 8039.0, distribution: 0.5405361817165591 ; i get attached easily.
.
not to people, really, but to behaviors. routines.
.
i've been attached to countless toxic behaviors in my past. .
when i was in the midst of my eating disorder i became attached to feeling hungry. the hunger pit in my stomach was a high.
.
when i was a slave to my exercise addiction i became attached to fatigue. i'd set an alarm for  AM and force myself to do crunches until i saw black and my heart cried for me to stop. i was stronger than those who prioritized sleep over fitness.
.
i grew attached to my disorder because i found comfort in its voice. it told me i was superior for making the decisions i made, and this confidence was intoxicating. .
what finally allowed me to walk away from this desperate relationship was being forced to evaluate how these behaviors were serving me, if at all. .
i was , severely underweight, in constant physical, emotional, and mental pain. i had lost all of my friends. i never left the house. i was withering away in the darkness of my room. all because i was attached to the wrong things.
.
i hated the place i was in. the headspace, the physical body, the emotional defeat. i hated every second i spent in illness. i was forced to evaluate what put me there. and that was attachment. .
the process of rebelling against an addiction is taxing, but the discomfort is temporary. it's liberating to willingly put yourself in the face of what scares you. to eat. to rest. to heal.
.
if you're battling a toxic attachment, all i can say to you is think about this. what would happen if you stopped showing up for the behavior that brings you misery? you'd face anxiety, of course, but that's because you'd be mourning a loss of familiarity. it's in the uncomfortable space that you'll grow. if something isn't serving you, walk away. even if it starts with a crawl.
.
life is too bright, the world is too big, there is so much more to see and feel and taste and hear and smell and experience. when you attach yourself to toxic thoughts, people, and behaviors, your world gets smaller. they say to bloom where you are planted. do that. but remember that you have legs and not roots, with freedom to live deeply and widely ✨

When you decide that the only way a person is a serious artist is if they are dying a little bit from it, or a lot from it - which we're very attracted to, that's a storyline we almost never get sick of seeing: the person who died, where you dance yourself to death or you're consumed by the great fire. There's something very glamorous about that. And I think young people particularly can be very attracted to that. But it's a bit of a death cult… There is a whole world of a people who would say that if you're not in pain when you're making art then you're doing it wrong. And again I do not think how tens of thousands of years of human beings made art. It's a very modern idea, a very grandiose idea, and it's a kind of a drug. This is not to say that darkness does not exist. I'm very respectful of darkness. But to bow at the altar of darkness at the exclusion of all other human emotions and urges, is to live a half life. Because that's not all there is. There's also joy, there's also wonder, there's also epiphany. There's also community, there's also grace, there's also playfulness.

Doc ID: 7573.0, distribution: 0.4917921076031394 ; growing up i had an eating disorder. it lived as a voice in my head. it convinced me of wild, disgustingly unhealthy beliefs. it created rules i couldn't break. it sheltered me, hid me from the world, shrunk me until i lost myself in thin air.
.
.
healing came through exposure. by testing feared waters. by simply doing the damn thing and seeing firsthand that the world wouldn't come crashing down. go up in flames.
.
.
how everything would be...fine. .
.
i was deathly afraid of most foods. of eating before a certain amount of hours passed between meals. of eating without working out that day. of not working out twice a day. the fears i held prevented me from leading a normal life. i was incapable of going with the flow or listening to my body. living in the real world threatened my disorder, so i chose not to.
.
.
but i was seventeen when i began recovering. i had an entire life ahead of me and college around the corner. i couldn't cling to these ways and expect to live a fulfilled life. .
.
i had to rebel against every last rule.
.
.
i ate the foods my disorder swore would ruin my life. i ate between meals when my stomach grumbled, not when the clock struck the perfect hour. i ate regardless of physical activity done for the day. i stopped doubling up on workouts. then i stopped working out altogether, for some time. .
.
exposure therapy is the only way to heal. how else do you expect to realize that the things you fear are irrational? you need to experience it directly. you need to walk into the fire you crafted in your head and walk out unburned, unscathed, just to realize that there simply isn't a fire at all. .
.
today, i engage in behaviors that used to be toxic fears. i now eat foods that once terrified me without thinking twice. i now work out to feel good and grow stronger, not to burn every morsel that enters my body. liberation washes over me as i nourish myself with the things that once brought me the greatest pain. .
.
this is healing. this is trying. this is what happens when you stop feeling sorry for yourself and pick yourself off, dust yourself off, and really kick this thing to the ground.
.
.
just try your best. your best will get better.

The fear of gaining weight is what stopped me. When I finally managed to take away the option of purging, I was so afraid of gaining weight that I didn't binge.For me, the bingeing and purging came first as a consequence of restriction, and subsequently (when I figured out this was what it did) I used it as a means of controlling uncomfortable emotions (and eventually any and all emotions), and when it was really out of control, I think it just became a response to eating anything. Once I started eating regularly and finding healthier outlets for my emotions in therapy, the binge urges eventually settled down. It took months that helps anon

T said “I wonder…” just as I began to speak. She broke off and then said she would save her thought for the end of the session. She did bring it up again towards the end of the session. She reflected on how earlier on in therapy we had lots of silences and I found them really difficult and just panicked and needed T to help me say what I was trying to say, whereas now when we have silences she senses they are different, that I am using them to think. She asked me if I would agree with that. I said I did.  She said “So when there's a silence now, should I just keep quiet and wait for you to work out what you want to say? Maybe we need a signal so that if you do need rescuing, I can tell. Because I don't want to speak too early and interrupt your train of thought, but I don't want to leave you if you're really stuck.” I answered “Yeah… I think I can just say if I get stuck now, like I would just come out and say it.” So we agreed that if I didn't say anything, then T would just continue to sit patiently and wait for me to speak.

It was all good really, because T knows how much I have struggled in my connection with her over the years. I think d's attachment to me may have been damaged when she was a baby because my eating disorder was at its worst and I wasn't as emotionally available for her as I could have been. I've been trying to make up for that time ever since I learnt more about attachment and could start to make sense of what was going on between us. This last year feels like it has been really healing for us. I found some small actions that d allowed me to do for her, and that started building more connection between us and seemed to let her start to take some nurture in. It's been tentative certainly on my part for months, wanting to push things but just the right amount, never quite sure exactly how much connection d will tolerate before she pushes me away. But now things feels so much better. Maybe it's been lockdown and having her at home and “in the nest” with me and that blast of more intensive nurturing. Maybe it's partly her age, growing through the age of , which in my three times of experience is not the nicest age. It was really good to talk about all this with T. It's all been going on in the background for the last year and longer and to reflect on it with T was helpful. I talked about how I had to override my mums voice in my head so many times, when I was trying to do small things to build connection with d. My mums voice that says “she can do that for herself!” and I imagine my mum shaking her head and thinking I am babying d. So I have had to learn to go against that, and although I know my mum can't see what I'm doing, I still felt guilty and wrong when I do so. I said to T that sometimes I feel a bit naughty doing something I know my mum would roll her eyes at, and T punched the air and said YESSSSS We talked a little bit about reading between the lines and how my parents could act like they were giving me a choice about something, while it not really being a choice because I also knew what they wanted me to choose. Kind of like “oh yes, you can do xyz if you like - but you'll have to do it for yourself/ pay for it yourself/ sort it out yourself” while knowing full well that any of those things would be beyond me in that situation. As a sensitive child, I could completely read that situation that meant that actually they didn't want me to do those things, and because I wanted to please them and avoid conflict, I would then go with the choice that I knew they wanted me to choose. A sort of emotional blackmail by my parents. I wanted to tie this in with T telling me the week before that she would always be honest and real with me, and how much that meant. The relief that she would just be upfront with me and I didn't have to read between the lines and try and figure out about what she might be actually be saying. But that's what we ran out of time to talk about so I will try and bring it up in tomorrow's session.

what IS wrong is the culture and industry that primarily markets all these things to us as ways to “shape our bodies”, lose weight, “burn fat”, change the way we look, and “be better”.

when diet culture seems to be literally *everywhere*, and food and exercise are so frequently tied to to appearance in the name of 'health', it can be really freaking hard to tune into your own body and even figure out what you really do or don't like.

but, through awareness, identification, educating ourselves, and choosing to go against the toxic messages that we have been taught to believe, we can learn to stop letting outside noise dictate our decisions and eventually change the way we think about food and exercise as a whole.

rather than thinking “should i eat?” and “what should i eat?”, you can begin to ask yourself “do i want to eat?” and “what do i want to eat?” 🤯 at the end of the day, food is just food. it doesn't need to be so complicated.

it's been over a week but i'm still feeling all the residual love that we shared at @biancataylorm and @nimai_delgado's wedding💍

current feels:
✨so blessed to be living this life 
✨so grateful for all these beautiful humans doing the inner work, putting aside pride and ego, sharing their experiences, and inspiring the world to live more IN and WITH love
✨so inspired to keep sharing and connecting and showing as many people as possible that true love is available for them (self, friends, partners, family)

thank you. i love you.

Because it's all the small moments in my quiet, slow life in the mountains with my chickens, small 🍑 & wonderful fiancé that really fill my heart with joy.

I love working on our little farm SO MUCH. I love slow living, I love being self-sustainable, I love caring for my chickens & gardens, I love seeing it all flourish & bloom because of the love I pour into it. It brings me so much peace. I'm truly living my cottage core farm girl dreams! 🐣🌾🍅👩🏻‍🌾

The beauty is that “success & happiness” can look different for all of us! So… What's a joyful life to you? (Outside of all the noise & the pressure that society adds) I'd love to know, because it's so cool learning about how different we all are & about all the unique little things we all find joy in. Some of us dream of apartment-living in the big smoke, some find joy in reading, or plants, or talking about cars, or learning, some dream of travelling the world with no permanent address, others dream of living by the ocean, or a white-picket fence. You deserve to create a life that is truly yours, with small everyday things that bring you peace & joy. 

I know that any “dream life” is a huge privilege that is becoming increasingly harder to obtain, but I hope this inspires you to believe that you're worthy & capable of creating the life you dream of… & in the meantime, you can still incorporate some small joyful actions into your lifestyle now that bring you peace & fulfill you along the way 💞

Disclaimer: not every day looks like this. This was filmed on a Sunday — the one day of the week that I dedicate to doing my bigger farm tasks + switch off from social media & work 🫶 #farmlife #slowliving #chickenlife #wholesome #feelgood #slowlife #selfsustainable #joyful #momentsoflife #nature #mountainlife

Growing up, I rarely thought twice about whether someone liked my outfit or heard me fart in the changing room (yes, I've done this and yes, people definitely heard 😅😂). I just lived my best life and to be honest with you, that's the way it should be! But I've also had my fair share of tears, tissues and time spent *wasted* (please let me emphasise) on caring too much about the judgement of others. They'll tell you you're ugly, you're ignorant, you have no life living at home. And wowwwww I've definitely fallen into the trap of believing all of it. Every. single. word!!! 😭
-
Now the sad reality is this: people's words and people's actions can be vile, cruel and completely unnecessary. And it's not easy to not care, I know all too well. But what you can start doing, from today, is making a conscious effort to stand your own ground. Focus on yourself. Love yourself, and remind yourself that what other people think does not define you. Embracing what you look like, who you are and how you choose to live your life every day is *the best* form of self care, like ever 🙌🏻
-
So cheers to showing all the critics, the jealous friends, the haters and maybe even that voice inside your very own head that we do not care what they think, and most importantly, that we're definitely not going to change because of it 🥂🤩

i can't be the only one hahaha. this recipe makes two servings if you're generous but i devoured the entire shake in under  minutes, so to each their own :')

details below— happy blending!

fudge brownie batter shake

vegan, gluten-free, high protein

makes two servings! 
-  large bananas, frozen
- - soft pitted dates
-  tbsp cacao powder
-  heaping tbsp peanut butter
-  scoops chocolate protein powder of choice
- enough non-dairy milk to cover everything in the blender (remember, less liquid = thicker shake, and you can always add more later. i'd say start with roughly / cup)

blend everything until smooth and uniform— this takes me about  minutes, moving the blender from low power to high power gradually. if you need more liquid to get the blender moving, add it in small increments.

transfer the shake to a glass and top with chocolate chips!

My faith has always been important to me, but it has shifted a lot over the years. I separated internally from progressive Christianity a while ago, still loving the social justice aspects but not in line theologically. So last fall I started attending a synagogue. For a year I've been in a course led by an amazing rabbi that had the potential to end in conversion - and that is the path I'm choosing.
 After spending a whole year thinking and praying and asking deep questions, I've decided that this is the right path for me. So in mid-September (waiting on the date to be officially set), I will go through the final steps of converting to reform Judaism. I've found more life and healing and connection in Judaism than I did elsewhere. I'm happy here.  I'm also considering using the Hebrew name I've chosen some on social media once the conversion process is complete, so if I start using multiple names in a couple months, that's why.  💜

 filing this under things I am learning, part : a lot of clinicians I've met claim to be “trauma-informed,” but almost none of them will define that (aside from the - generic principles which are very non-specific), so here are a few things that I've found in my experience to be true.  good, trauma-informed clinicians or programs: • titrate the work (otherwise a person goes into reliving and it can be re-traumatizing) and don't rush into the heavy processing right away • approach symptoms / behaviors with compassion (especially self-destructive symptoms!!) and see how they function to help your system survive  • don't push for you to “try harder” or “find motivation” or pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps into healing • respect your window of tolerance and regularly check in to see how your system is tolerating the work • don't force you to be deeply in your body in the name of “presence” or “embodiment” or “mindfulness” when you are not yet capable of tolerating that • have healthy boundaries (boundaries may have been confusing or lacking for people with relational trauma, so this is super important) • respect autonomy and  agency

Doc ID: 175.0, distribution: 0.501136362821179 ; youmakesenseproject:  the world can feel overwhelming sometimes, particularly for people with a history of trauma. it can reinforce that sense of, “see? I was right to never let down my guard. something bad IS happening - I knew we weren't safe.”  PTSD tells us to always stay in a state of alertness, even when we are physically safe. we can never rest. but the truth is, staying hyper-vigilant doesn't actually protect us. it simply makes us *feel* less out of control.  but even in times of collective anxiety (ESPECIALLY in times of collective anxiety), we can learn to create internal safety for ourselves. we can begin to take our heightened systems down a few a notches, treating our anxiety with the care that we would a small child.  perhaps it's okay to set down your armor for a few moments, even if you pick it right back up after.  perhaps it's okay to feel a sense of safety and not be on rigid alert every second.

I followed the example of a puzzler I follow on Instagram, where instead of starting with the edge pieces, I sorted all the pieces into piles of colours. Then I put them together, filled in the pieces around them, and did the edges last. It works for puzzles like this but I'm not sure it works so well for puzzles where you don't have big blocks of colour. It's an approach I'm going to practice though.

It always feels special going back to this place. This is ultimate cheese, but I'll forever be grateful for everything Cambridge taught me. The highs, the lows. The stressful, go-go-go terms and the rare nights out clubbing (which were. a. vibe. let me tell you 😏). It's also, and of course, where Holly Gabrielle all started. I truly wouldn't be here without my time at Cambridge and I'll never forget my  years (or  seconds as it felt like, one big blur basically 😅).
-
I also truly believe that everything happens for a reason. My rejection. My gap year. My master's. It's all helped me reach where I am today. And that's simply happy. The happiest I've ever been in fact.
-
My talk yesterday was all about 'life outside the bubble'. Cambridge was my bubble, and I'm now pushing beyond my little Holly bubble to find my own feet. Carve my own mould and fill my own shoes. I'm not % certain about the future, but I'm certainly not certain AND miserable (thank you @steven for this nugget of pure wisdom 👌🏻)!!!
-
I'll share some of the talk with you guys in the vlog coming out later this week, and as always, here's to whatever happens in the future 🥂 (ps: *I'm not pregnant *see last photo* 🤰🏻😂)

i poked and grabbed. i wasn't satisfied with the shape of x, or the softness of y. my mind instantly painted the situation as problem/solution.

what i mean by this is that i looked at these body parts as they were, and i told myself that there was a problem; a problem that was causing them to look this way. this is a narrative deeply ingrained in my being. i am aware of it. i am conscious of it. it is a whisper that i have virtually muted, and when it slips through the cracks, i am able to catch it.

but that doesn't mean it's not there.

you see, the words we use to speak to ourselves can alter the course of our lives. by analyzing a body part and thinking, “the problem is…”, i'm telling myself that ) this body part isn't SUPPOSED to look this way, and ) it is my fault, that i am to BLAME for not having executed the solution.

in the past i've let this language win. and when it wins, it ends in misery. it ends in self-torture, bending over backwards to desperately alter the body that stands before me in the mirror. that “solution” i'm looking for? it doesn't exist. nothing will ever be % satisfactory.

the narrative i've shifted to instead falls along the lines of “this is how i was built”, “this is the body that was intended to carry me all along”. this narrative does not have hints of failure or blame on my behalf. it harbors acceptance for what is and what is meant to be. it is hard work. this is not always my default mindset. but it's the one i work diligently to calling on each day. 
this is not discourage pursuits to change our bodies or efforts to grow stronger and more confident. it's just a reminder to be mindful of our intentions and the way we speak to ourselves, always ♥️

——
it's christmas eve, and i know that the holiday season can be really hard for those of you who are struggling with your relationship with food. as much as i wish i could give you an easy answer for how to not binge after a large dinner or eating  cookies or how to not worry about everything that's in what you're eating, i know it's not that simple and easy.  it took me YEARS to get to where i am with food, and what eventually helped me to fully heal were letting go of the ideas that eating less was better, that different foods were “good” and “bad”, that calories were meant to be “burned off”, that gaining weight was a bad thing, etc., and trusting and committing to the process of honoring my body and giving myself *UNCONDITIONAL* permission to eat (i promise the time it takes is worth it).
——
the ability to not binge after eating multiple desserts or to go into a big meal and not even think about how many calories you may be eating isn't something that happens overnight, and real change takes time. while i don't have any quick fixes for you, i hope you remember what this time of year is really about, think about the things you hope to look back fondly on, know that it's okay to do what you need to do to protect your own peace, celebrate every small step and win you have, and give yourself the grace and compassion you deserve.

Doc ID: 9603.0, distribution: 0.487200258247397 ; reminders to stop comparing yourself to others and caring so much about what others think!

YOU WILL NEVER BE FOR EVERYONE- some people like their coffee black, some like it with cream, some like it iced, some like it hot, and some people don't like it at all. you might not be for everyone, but you can  always work on accepting yourself.

YOU DON'T SEE THE FULL PICTURE- you don't know what internal struggles other people are going through. you don't see what people are or aren't doing outside of the moments you see. on social media and in real life, you never see the full reality of other people's lives, but you see all of your own.

WISH OTHER PEOPLE THE BEST- you might not see what other people are dealing with behind the scenes, but you can still wish them happiness. if someone is celebrating an accomplishment, you can wish them happiness without beating yourself up for not accomplishing the same. if someone is showing their healthy lifestyle changes, you can wish them health and happiness without feeling like you need to make the same changes they are. “you can admire someone else's garden while still watering and admiring your own”.

PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND HOW YOU FEEL- do you find yourself comparing and feeling pressured when you're on social media? set boundaries with it and take breaks. do certain accounts make you feel worse about yourself? protect yourself, and mute, unfollow, or block accounts that aren't serving you (you can always undo this). do certain people make you feel appreciated and comfortable being your authentic self? spend more time with them.

BUILD YOURSELF UP SO YOU DON'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU- other people's opinions of you, positive or negative, are none of your business. be kind to yourself, spend time with yourself, learn to accept yourself, and treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend because at the end of the day, you're what you've got, so YOUR opinion of you matters way more than other's.

there's other people's expectations and society's standards, but we get to make the rules for our own lives! i say we live it!!!

Just wanted maybe some tips've been doing Skype therapy for so long, it feels very normal to me now. I sometimes tease T that she just lives in my computer. (She likes to psychoanalyse that though, like “but I do have a real life, Faith”.) I think it will feel awkward at first, but get yourself in a routine. Try and Skype from the same place each session, this helps it feel like your 'therapy spot' and settling into it is similar to settling into the therapy room. There are benefits. For example you can have notes next to you to refer to, you can sit on your bed (in your bed!), you may feel more relaxed in your own house, it's easier to be on time. Also you don't have to get up and leave at the end of your session. I really like that. Once you get settled into it and start talking, I think you will get used to it quite fast. It's really worth a try! Let me know how it goes x

T said I can't expect it to do its job when I don't give it any fuel. She said she could tell from my smile that I knew she was talking logic. I said it was just that I didn't want to get in an argument about it - because really we are both on the same side.  She said she would check in with me next week how it was going.

You won't have to go through life worrying about every single calorie and every single meal. You can enjoy dinner with your family without panicking about it. You can live life without it revolving around food. You won't have to lie to the people you care about anymore.You can actually have fun on your birthday.Fighting with people you care about over whether or not you've eaten is boring and painful. Because there is more to life than food. Because losing friends is not fun. You can enjoy social occasions without worrying about food.You won't feel so constantly exhausted and drained all the time.Thinking and dreaming about and being consumed by food is no way to live.Feeling dizzy and cold and tired keeps you from living a happy, fulfilling life.Recovery will give you the chance to LIVE and to be alive, rather than just existing.Because you deserve to have happy thoughts in your head, instead of numbers. Your recovery can inspire and aid the recovery of others. Instead of passing on disordered behavior, you can pass on health and support and encouragement. Your skin will improve, as will your mental clarity. Eating right (and enough) can greatly help symptoms of depression and anxiety.Because you don't deserve to cry yourself to sleep anymore.You deserve to be able to genuinely smile again. You deserve to be able to go outside and enjoy your day without worrying about what you're wearing and whether or not you look okay. You won't have to waste money on food to binge on anymore.Your feet and legs will stop falling asleep and going numb when you sit down.Your hair will stop falling out.Your skin will finally be able to heal itself. You deserve to be glowing. It's nice to not feel like death anymore. It's nice to not smell like vomit anymore. It's nice to be able to go out and actually enjoy yourself again. Your general health will improve and you'll be less susceptible to colds and viruses. You won't have to feel guilty about breaking your promises. You won't have to lie to everyone around you. You'll be able to go out and dance at parties you're fortunate enough to still have healthy teeth, recovery will prevent them from rotting. You are worth so much more than just a number on a scale. It's nice to not be constantly cold and nauseous all the time. Because crying in your room is never a good way to spend a Friday night.You can finally live without guilt. Guilt that you ate when you didn't think you deserved to eat. Guilt that you haven't eaten and you're letting loved ones down. Guilt that you binged. Guilt that you purged. Guilt that deep down you've forgotten how to love yourself. Your bones won't be brittle and easy to break anymore. You'll be able to sleep at night without hunger pains keeping you awake.Be confident again. 

So you don't feel like a complete  utter hypocrite when trying to help someone that is in the same position as you.



So you can enjoy “family time”  not worry about eating “bad food”

So that you don't spit up after eating because your esophagus is so fucked up from purging. So you don't miss out on life. Because it's nice waking up and thinking about what art you can create, what places you can explore, what books you can read, what people you can meet, what songs you can sing, what sports you can play, instead of thinking about what you're going to eat and not eat that day.Watching Netflix is a lot more fun than watching “thinspiration” videos. It's nice to wake up in the morning with energy, instead of waking up tired from not eating, or sick from binging. So that you can get up in the morning and see clearly, instead of seeing spots or having black vision as you try to sit up. You deserve to love yourself again. You deserve to accept love from those around you again. You deserve to be able to go shopping without having panic attacks and breakdowns in the changing room. You can eat your favorite foods without guilt and anxiety. You'll have enough energy to do the things you enjoy. You can be active, and run or play sports for the fun of it, not for weight loss. You can have a life again. You'll be able to sleep at night. Aren't you tired of feeling worthless and guilty?You'll be able to go out without thinking that everyone is staring at you. Go into a grocery store feeling safe. You won't have to be scared of going to the doctor anymore.You won't have to excuse yourself from work or social events to purge.Recover so you don't have to see the scared, heartbroken look on your mother's face when she hears you purging. Recover so you can go on a date and feel happy and not worry.Recover so that you can share your story and help others recover. You won't have to waste any more money on laxatives. Your eating disorder won't be feeding your anxiety and depression anymore.ALL of us deserve a better life than ED hell. You'll be able to have children someday if you want to. 

So you can make spontaneous plans to go out, and not have to check or worry if they'll “fit in” with the eating disorder.



So you can spend time having interesting conversations with people, without your mind wandering off to do calorie counts.

You don't have to feel guilty when people buy you food, because you won't have to waste it anymore. So you can live a happy, free, fulfilled life. So you can feel unafraid for the first time in a long time. So you can have and actually sustain healthy relationships with people (family, friends, significant other) without the eating disorder causing fights and pushing them away. You can walk around town with a friend or go to events without worrying about passing out. You don't have to lie awake at night worrying about the damage you're doing to yourself. When you give your body the fuel it needs, your physical AND mental health will improve. Your self-confidence will improve. You can get your natural skin tone back, and not look gray and sickly pale all the time.Your blood pressure and heart rate will go back to normal. You'll be able to enjoy hot baths and showers again.  You won't have so much gas or bloating or stomach pains anymore. Your intestinal and digestive health will slowly heal itself. You can stop punishing yourself for eating. You can sit up for more than  minutes without your stomach hurting.You won't have to debate for an hour before eating an apple. Your room won't smell like vomit and moldy food. So you don't get up in the middle of the night feeling as though you need to do  sit-ups before you can sleep and then spend all day feeling tired, and ill.

You won't trigger others anymore. 

So you dont end up in hospital at am because your bowels are bleeding due to your ED

You won't be constantly dehydrated anymore.When you look back on your life, you'll have happy memories too, not just empty memories of anorexia  won't have to isolate yourself anymore.

Because life can, and should be, so much more.

Please feel free to add onto this list, and share your own stories and reasons for recovery. I love you guys and my inbox is always open.

.
during my eating disorder,  my skin took an alarming hit. terribly dehydrated because i was afraid to drink water. pale and gray because i robbed my body of the nutrients it desperately needed.
.
during this time i also developed a rigorous case of anxiety. i was constantly paranoid, and to cope i would mindlessly pick at my skin. it was pain i could control...to mask the pain i couldn't. .
.
so now we have dry, pale, blistered and red skin.
.
even in good health, my skin has continued to be an issue. it seems like no matter what i do i'm constantly red, dry…something.
.
and then, it happened. my solution fell into my lap (mailbox).
.
last month my generous friend @daninemeh sent me some goodies. in the package she included the chlorophyll face mask by @cocokindskincare. i had never used anything from this brand but decided to try it out.
.
not to be dramatic, but this mask changed my life. it's super delicate so i use it every night (or in the morning if i have time)! after about  weeks of using, i saw tremendous changes in my skin. it was glowing, it was clear…and it was staying this way. coco, thank you for your magic!
.
this is in no way sponsored by any brand mentioned below. i've just gotten a lot of interest in my skin routine and this has been such a pivotal component for me!
.
to give a quick run down of my routine and other products...
- i was my face with @cerave skin renewing facial cleanser right when i wake up
- after wearing makeup for the day, i use a makeup wipe to remove it. then i wash my face again with this wash, and then use the @cerave hydrating micellar water to really make sure its all gone. then i use the cocokind mask!
- after i wash off the mask i use the cerave skin renewing night cream
.
as far as daily makeup goes, i usually wear a light base of foundation, some blush, and just curl my eyelashes. mascara if i HAVE to, but i hate taking that ish off 😪 i also drink a ton of water and that has helped! i have a @healthyhumanlife  oz water bottle that i refill -x a day! if you have any questions drop them below babies 💫

Got an outfit for that! Picnic? Sorted. Date night? Sorted! Fancy event? SORTED!!! The way we dress and carry ourselves can make up such a big part of our identity. I used to only ever wear long black jeans, a jumper & a scarf to hide myself & not stand out... Now I wear what I truly want to wear & I feel so much more like ME!

super green lentil soup (altered from jessica prescott's book 'vegan one pot wonders')

- cup dried lentils, soaked in boiling water for  hours
- onion, diced
- clove of garlic, minced
- cup each of diced carrots and celery
- bunch green chard, washed and chopped into small pieces
- cups water
- cups vegetable broth
-olive oil
-sea salt, garlic, cumin

heat a generous pour of olive oil in a stovetop pot and add the onions and garlic. cook for a few minutes until browned, then add carrots and celery. cook for a few more minutes until softened. drain lentils and add to the pot with the water, broth, and spices. bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook without the lid for about  minutes. add the chard to the pot once the lentils are softened. don't stir them in, rather leave them on top and cover with the lid for five minutes. remove lid, stir the greens through, and add any last spices based on your taste preferences.

It took me a long long time to build up trust with her (now I see that was transference and I was just very scared of her responding to me the way important people have in the past) but she must have learnt a lot about me through that period. I think it really depends how your therapist works, but one useful tip I learnt in therapy is if I get stuck, to talk about the process. So I say, “I have a list of things here but they're too hard to start talking about”. Or “I have thoughts in my head but I can't put them into words” etc. Then T knows what I'm thinking (remembering she's not a mind-reader!) and she can help me move forward.I'm happy for you to private message me but apologies in advance if I don't always reply very speedily 😊

we are told to “just be ourselves”, which is a nice sentiment, but it's hard to do when this world we live in constantly tells us that “being ourselves” is not good enough and tries to turn us into something we are not.  if we do embrace who we really are, we might be put into the categories weird, crazy, different.  maybe you'd lose some “popularity” by being boldly you, but think about everything else you'd lose by not:
the ability to form authentic deep connections
the ability to see things from a truly different perspective
an identity that belongs solely to you
what really makes you sparkle ✨

to do absolutely nothing different.

i'm bloated, and i'm not going to dissect my body, restrict my food, or force myself to move my body. those are not options for me anymore. instead, i'm going to continue to accept my body, listen to my body, honor my body, and eat a slice (or however many i feel like) of this raw vegan snickers pie from my super talented friend @annaintheraw (which you can find at her cafe @annaintherawcafe in downtown cleveland) ✌🏽

How do you know if relationships are real or just convenience? How do you know what to talk about without feeling either really boring or like you're taking up too much of the conversation? It's something I'm struggling with now I'm no longer in an academic environment and am in the “real world” 😩 Answer: My closest friends currently I made through a)having babies I've seen more and more is people on postcode groups on Facebook asking for people to get to know. Or people running groups with the purpose of bringing local people together. Have a little poke around and see if you can find anything.If you feel like you're talking too much about yourself, you can always call yourself out on it. Say it's because you're anxious or nervous or stressed but now you'll shut up and give them a chance to talk. They might be happy to have the pressure taken off them to talk, but in the end it's best if both of you take part in the conversation so it doesn't feel one sided either way. (Disclaimer: I still sometimes leave conversations with people who I have solid friendships with, and wonder if I talked too much or monopolised the conversation, so I'm not sure that fear ever completely goes away)I hope some of that is a little bit helpful. It's hard to know exactly what makes two people click so well, but the more feelers you put out and potential friends you meet, the more likely you are to find a couple of people who are just right for you. Good luck!

Doc ID: 4554.0, distribution: 0.6045024255030793 ; Therapy .. // a meh session  Two session ago, I spent a big part of my therapy session talking about a conversation I'd had with my sister about our childhood. I think my sister has been processing some thoughts about it because she had a lot to say. I protected her to some extent when we were small - she is . years younger than me - and she seems able to look back on our childhood from a less “traumatised” viewpoint. I still struggle a lot with invalidating myself over it, so one minute I am thinking about how difficult and 'wrong' some bits of it were, and the next minute I'm thinking that here I am, a surviving thriving adult, and so I'm just exaggerating and clearly my childhood must have been fine. T always has something to say when I voice these thoughts, but I don't seem able to hold on to what she says. This session I tried to carry on talking about the conversation with my sister, but I couldn't really get back into it. It was so frustrating. We did talk about it a bit but not to the same depth. Then I got frustrated with myself for not being able to organise my thoughts into words, and for feeling like I wasn't connecting with T. I tried to honour where my brain was going and say what popped into mind even if it meant we jumped around a bit within the general topic of my childhood. When we got towards the end of the session, T said “I'm just giving you a warning that we've got about  minutes left to finish talking about this for today” which was helpful. And better than the previous week when we ended a bit too abruptly. So we finished off that topic and T asked a few questions about more general things. Then I remembered I wanted to offload really about my parents coming to visit but not staying with us, so I got vaguer and vaguer with my answers to T and eventually I said “Can I just talk about something else?”. We had about  minutes left at this point, so T was like, Yep go for it! Get it all said! I quickly told her the situation and she asked “what's the first thing that comes to mind as to the reason they're not staying with you?” “They know I'm talking about them in therapy and they don't like it” I replied.  T looked at me.”Yeah…. that's magical thinking. How would they know?” “I don't know, it's just what I think! Why else wouldn't they come? They've always stayed with us before.” T tried to suggest some alternative reasons, which I do agree are reasonable. It just seems weird that they've suddenly decided to pay for a hotel rather than stay with us. I feel a bit rejected. 
 Then we really were out of time so we wound the session up. It didn't feel like we'd achieved much but maybe it was good to have a low key consolidation session that just tied up some of what we'd been talking about the week before.

heat the oven to F and grease a cookie sheet. in a small bowl, mix the melted butter and cacao powder until smooth and uniform. in a separate bowl, mix the egg and egg yolk with the coconut sugar and vanilla. stir in the melted butter/cacao mixture and set aside. in another bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder and salt. add the wet mixture to the dry by folding until well combined. stir through chocolate (i like using chopped chocolate for cookies because it melts and spreads). drop the dough onto the cookie sheet and top each cookie with more chocolate if desired. bake for - minutes and let cool completely before enjoying!

Answer: No.I've been so so hypervigilantly careful about how I talk about food, eating or weight around them. I never guilt them for their hunger or comment negatively on what they're eating, never talk about good or bad foods, never compliment or criticise or commment on their body shape or size, I never talk about dieting etc etc That doesn't mean they won't ever get hang ups around food or even develop an eating disorder but I've done my best to create a healthy environment where food just is not an issue at all. The exact opposite to what I grew up with, in fact.

recently ive undergone a shift of heart and taken step after step outside of my comfort zone. this year has changed my life. i stopped saying no, started to put myself out there. this weekend i met these girls for the first time and i already know i have friends for life. between them and my OG squad (hi @the_bananadiaries @fitstrongshann @arunnersappetite 🥰), i've finally fallen into groups that fill me up. i never thought i'd find friendships like these. my fifteen year old self is in awe. my twenty one year old self is eternally grateful...and still a little loopy after this weekend (🍻), but cut her some slack. she's living her damn life and she's loving every second ♥️

FYI — these things aren't flaws. You aren't flawed. You're a normal human being with normal human features. 

The media / internet has a good way of making us feel “flawed” or in need of fixing... So, I'll just be here sprinkling some reality on your feed because sometimes it's hard to snap out of all the noise, all the comparison, all the trends & all the things we feel like we should be doing. 

This is my WHY… I post this kind of content because the more we see it, the more we normalise it. If somebody sees me embracing the features that have always been branded as “bad” or “ugly”, then perhaps they'll feel less alone & it'll help them like themselves more too, perhaps they'll/you'll see that it's possible to find confidence in your skin without having to “perfect” your body first.

I mean no ill will to those who posted the videos shown in this, there's enough space for everyone's content & I recognise that people find inspiration in different types of content, but I think it's a great example of:
📱 what scrolling through social media can be like & how prevalent that kind of content/messaging is
📱 how often we can be caught in comparison or not feeling good enough
In short, I just want this corner of the internet to feel safe & make you feel good, instead of worse 🤝💗

I know I can't represent all body types, but I CAN showcase my reality & while I don't expect everyone to be able to relate or find value in my posts, I just want to be part of the change I wish to see in the world. 

I hope these lil doses of reality remind you that you don't have to look like ✨them✨ because being you is good enough 🌷

——
growing up as a first generation chinese-american, a figure skater, a dancer, and a musician and being raised to become a future doctor, to be polite and obedient, and to aim to be the best at everything i did, i have always felt an immense pressure to do more and to be more, and i honestly didn't really know who i was without any of the pressures and expectations being set on me.
——
in th grade, i quit figure skating, a sport i had grown to identify with and later that year, i attempted to take my life for the first time. at the start of high school, my mom (with no bad intentions at all) came home and told me a patient of hers had lost weight by eating - calories a day (the amount of food a toddler eats fyi), and that day i decided to start counting my calories...which is what triggered the start of my eating disorder journey.  while there were a number of factors that probably put me at risk for developing an eating disorder at that time, counting calories was the catalyst.  while the years after that are somewhat of a blur to me (probably from not fueling my body properly and thinking about food /), i struggled with OSFEDs, binge eating disorder, and then disordered eating (quasi recovery) before committing to achieve food freedom.
——
i love that this year's theme is #ComeAsYouAre because acceptance was HUGE for me on my own journey. while in the end, the acceptance i truly needed to finally break free was my own, having a community that supports you and has your back can mean a lot.

i hope this week is a reminder to us all that we are imperfectly human, we are unique, and we are all just doing our best in this world.  no matter your size, shape, age, race, ethnicity, or experiences, your struggles are valid, and i welcome you into my community with open arms 🤗

what you might not know is that ice cream and i did not have always such a positive and easygoing relationship. keeping a container of ice cream in my house used to terrify me because i knew that the moment i'd crack into one, i wouldn't be able to stop until i hit the bottom. going out for ice cream with friends wasn't something i enjoyed doing because it meant planning my entire day of food around it so that i wouldn't go over my “daily allowance” of food.

eating ice cream brought me a lot of stress, fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, and negative emotions, and the restriction i'd place on myself led to YEARS of being stuck in a binge-restrict cycle.

how did i get past that? by facing my fears, giving myself unconditional permission to eat whatever whenever without any timeline to ever stop this (i still do this because it's a lifestyle to me), and not letting any negative thoughts that might creep into my head affect my actions.

did this initially lead to me feeling like i was just binging constantly? yes.

did i gain weight? yes.

did i receive some negative pushback? yes.

did i ever want to go back to restricting? yes.

did this eventually change my all or nothing mindset around food, allow me to be the realest version of myself, and guide me to genuinely being happier? absofreakinglutely, and choosing to do it was the best thing i could've done for myself.

 I hate admitting that I struggle with body image. I hate it. I want to think that having critical awareness of our culture's views / treatment of women's bodies has made me immune to believing those things. 

 But the reality is, living a society where patriarchal beauty standards are shoved down our throats on a daily basis means that if you're a woman, you probably don't make it out of this thing alive without some issues around body image.

 I can't change society overnight (unfortunately), but dammit, I will do my best to talk about this and be authentic about my struggles.

I haven't posted an update in a while bc I've been trying to use social media less. I'm doing okay but it's been a hard few weeks. I was doing really well with my meal plan and maintaining safety but then all hell broke loose when all the built up emotions became too much. I ended up having to go to the ER for the weekend and I now have a worse concussion. Then I got all of my belongings taken away and was put on one to one supervision for a couple days. I now have less restrictions although I'm only allowed in one hallway.

T suggested that some of my fears came about from what was going on in my family. Little-Faith had a huge fear of bombs for a while, very irrational but very very real. T connected it to the fact that there were people in my life who were prone to exploding unpredictably on a regular basis.  She did slip-up and get out of the story language and started asking a question saying “you” and “yours”, and it made me freeze up. When I could speak again, I said “uh…. that's too much crossover between the story and my life” T summarised and said “so little-Faith had about  bombs a year going off in her life…” I had never thought about it like that. I am glad T has moved away from her neutral position. Now I feel like she is on my side. That matters. I asked really quietly, “Um… so would you say… that it would make sense that she was always on edge?” T said in a really compassionate voice, “it makes ABSOLUTE sense… no wonder she was anxious!”  I couldn't look at her at this point because I was just about holding it together. But it was so so helpful to feel her validation and understanding.

And if I knew how she worked, I would know how to go about find out what I want to know. Kinda like a chicken and egg situation.And thanks!  x

We got to the last ten minutes of the session and I could tell she was trying to do a bit of a repair and end on a positive note. T said “I know this is really difficult for you to talk about” and I know she was trying to be empathetic, but in this case she was wrong. It's not really difficult for me to talk about, I could talk about it endlessly. It's just difficult for me to explain it to her. “Is it difficult because you can't explain or because I can't understand?” T asked. I went silent, because I do think it's her that's not understanding, rather than me that's not explaining. I just say it's me because it deflects from me putting the blame on her. Eventually I said “Uh… it's that you can't understand”. T nodded thoughtfully. I said “I don't think it's that complicated. It's just frustrating! I feel very frustrated.”  That's when T tried another approach to repair the rupture and said about being willing to go to the hard places with me. That was more successful and I did hear what she was saying. I think by hard places, she was referring not just to subject matter but also the hard places we hit in our relationship. And I do appreciate that. That she's not scared of these times where we are wrestling to understand each other. She knows we will get through it if we both hang in there. I'm glad I'll see her tomorrow.

Doc ID: 2363.0, distribution: 0.4359220311612981 ; Question: what would you consider to be a relapse for your eating disorder? Answer: Red flags would be purging (even just once), skipping meals more than on the odd occasion, abusing laxatives, buying weighing scales, noticing I was fixating on food continually, making certain foods off limits (restricting of any sort, even something for Lent or say, Dry January, triggers me), turning down social events because they feature food.None of those alone would necessarily mean a relapse because it depends what's going on mentally. They could be a blip or a lapse that gets back on track. A relapse to me is when it spirals out of control again. It would probably be a result of a combination of things that would end up causing a perfect storm of a relapse. So a relapse would be when I had (temporarily) lost the ability to maintain healthy eating behaviours.

Doc ID: 2762.0, distribution: 0.6367846837062798 ; This is a page from the book Unshame, by Carolyn Spring. I posted the quote in an earlier post. When I read it this weekend, it blew my mind. I wasn't looking for myself in the pages, but as soon as I read the line about feeling wrong for wanting to be close, it started resonating in my brain.   T and I have spoken in the last couple of weeks about how the way my body still reacts to my dad, even as an adult, is evidence of what I experienced as a child. I could get my head round that. But what the evidence still didn't tell me is, was the situation that: a) my dad was scary and I was normal Or b) my dad was normal and I was hopelessly non-resilient I thought about it some more and concluded that even if the problem was me, even if it was that I just cried too much and too easily, then maybe a parent's job should have been to treat that gently and find a way to connect without shaming or blaming. But I haven't had chance to discuss that with T and find out if she thinks it's a reasonable conclusion. Then I read this and it seems to back up my thought. That I have ended up thinking the problem was me. This page seems to say that it is entirely predictable that I would think the problem was me, because that's what children do. It's almost impossible for a child to conclude otherwise, because of the way their brains respond in the attachment relationship. Also the first underlined sentence brings up the yearning I had to be close to my mum as a child, and how she didn't seem able to welcome that, while at the same time letting me believe that what we did have was closeness. So confusing…. to believe that this avoidant dance was closeness. And now to try and sort all this out in my head. I honestly think it was easier to be arguing with my therapist about food and whether or not I was going to eat lunch. This afternoon I sent T this photo, and said that reading this blew my mind a bit even though I'm sure she has said it to me about a hundred times already. T replied that she was looking forward to picking up the pieces of my mind in our session tomorrow…. I wonder if I will be able to put into words what I have written in this post.

Answer: It doesn't really look like an actual hospital but it is less homey than other units I've seen. The patient rooms are much nicer and we don't have a ton of medical equipment around. I think it mostly looks like a hospital because of the fluorescent lights and giant nurses' station in the middle of the unit. The unit I'm on is newly renovated so it's very nice and modern but it's also more clean cut and sterile looking if that makes sense. The other short term unit at this hospital is older and looks less like a hospital than my unit.

When is it ok to post “normal” stuff again?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I had this conversation with my social media clients this week, and I figured some of you might be wondering the same thing. After all, it's jarring to scroll through Instagram and see a filtered selfie or #OOTD next to videos of police brutality.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I saw a comment last night that made my heart sink — someone thanking a white influencer for sharing something not about racism. “It's a breath of fresh air to see something lighthearted,” they said.
⁣⁣
I am profoundly jealous of you if you found out about systemic racism in the last two weeks. It's a privilege to learn about it instead of living it, and it baffles me that some white people are already tired.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But where does that leave us? Should you feel guilty if you want to share a picture of your latte instead of a call to action?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The hashtags will stop trending. People will move on. I don't care when your social media feed returns to its regularly scheduled content, but I challenge you to not let this viral movement become a distant memory.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉🏾 Set up recurring donations to Black nonprofits (if you're able).⁣⁣ Patronize Black-owned businesses.
⁣⁣
👉🏾 Have hard conversations with your employer, your church, your organizations if there's a lack of diversity in leadership.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
👉🏾 Continue to call out the racists in your life & to examine your own biases.
⁣⁣
👉🏾 Keep tabs on local officials, and vote out leaders who don't hold police accountable.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Call me a hopeless optimist, but change starts with us — and it's bigger than black squares, or following Black creators, or signing one petition. There's a lot of work to be done. Let's do it. [📸: @affordablebyamanda]
