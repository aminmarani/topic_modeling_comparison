i love banana bread as much as the next foodie, but there's something about a banana cake coated in melted chocolate that's so warm and nostalgic to me. this recipe is everything you'd dream of in a banana cake— hope you save it to try this week! 

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

this recipe is wild hahaha. the first layer is a rich, fudgy, cookie dough-like brownie bite. the middle is a decadent and perfectly sweet and salty mix of caramel pecan pie. and the third, in signature healthful fashion, is a hearty coating of thick chocolate. there's really nothing you won't love about these. did i mention the recipe comes together in under  minutes and there's no baking required? 

say less…

double fudge no-bake caramel pecan pie brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- - soft pitted dates
-  tbsp creamy tahini
- / cup raw pecans, finely chopped 

add the dates and tahini to a food process or blender and blend until a thick, sticky paste forms. this took about  minutes for me. at this point stir through the pecans until fully coated. transfer this layer to the base layer and spread evenly.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

A “bad body image” day can triggered by many things… One is catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. All of a sudden… 💥 a negative thought appears & it's all downhill from there.

But a lot of the time, what you see in the mirror doesn't reflect the reality of the situation.

. We are all our own harshest critics & . Mirrors are all different! Especially fitting rooms. Some use mirror manipulation to deceive customers into “feeling slimmer” or taller when trying on their clothing. Other stores use lighting that is softer, to hide the lumps & bumps we have on our bodies. But then there are also stores that use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... And in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!

Aside from that, sizing differs so much 😅 slide  is me wearing the EXACT SAME SIZE jeans. I can feel comfy in one pair, meanwhile other pairs would leave my tummy bulging over them or would refuse to zip up! I found myself sizing up & down depending on the jeans! 🤯 (Although, sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

“If we base our self-worth around something as ever-changing as our bodies, we'll forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession & shame” - Chrissy King.

These posts are here every week to remind you not to compare yourself to the % of someone's life that you see online. There is NOTHING wrong with having a tummy, cellulite, stretch marks, scars, hip dips, or anything else. Most of us have them!!

Please remember to be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

Doc ID: 2456, distribution: 0.9723579402414508 ; Lately I've noticed more paparazzi photos of celebrities are making a comeback to the headlines. Swipe for the photo I've seen floating around online. 

People are commenting about how they can't believe a young woman's body looks like that, among other things, which always shocks me. I feel for those who believe that simply seeing someone else's body is an invitation for them to judge it. 

But have we really become so accustomed to these picture-perfect photos of people online or on magazine covers that we can't possibly comprehend a body with cellulite, stretch marks, belly rolls, body fat, things that wobble or bits that sag? 

To be completely honest with you, seeing photos of REAL bodies always made me feel relieved, a sense of “oh, they're human!” or “yay, she looks like me!” And in the same breath also seeing those comments picking bodies like ours apart, which always made me want to hide my body from everyone, even myself.

So I'm leaving this here (like every other Monday) as a tribute to anyone who has ever felt like they had to hide themselves, to remind you that what you see online & even in real life isn't always as it seems. You have nothing to be ashamed of. We're all human & having lumps, bumps, stretchies & loose skin (etc) is just another very human feature, NOT a flaw 🌸

& yes I acknowledge I am saying this as an able-bodied woman who is still considered thin by society's standards. So, I can only showcase my reality, but I'd rather that then portray some sort of perfection online. Here's to focusing on creating a happier, healthier relationship with our body image & no longer listening to that critical inner-voice! Happy Real Me Monday 🌻 

Oh & Camila, you're absolutely bangin'!!! Showing up as your true self & showcasing REAL bodies like this always keeps me encouraged to do the same 💖

Trust me, it's like a SUPERPOWER 🦸 

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

If I saw other women with realistic, relatable, healthy & normal features in magazines growing up, it would've caused my confidence to: 📈 instead of: 📉

Instead, we see the photoshopped versions of the people we look up to, and when we do see someone with similar features to us, it's plastered all over the front page with derogatory headlines (swipe across to see what I mean 😓)

 in  women struggle with their body image… Are you one of them? If you are, leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments & if you're not, leave a “🥰”.

We're quite literally brought up to believe the body we're born in needs to be fixed & scared into new short-term, unsustainable diet fads each week instead of being inspired to be our healthiest & happiest selves long-term.

Now, I know I can't possibly represent everyone because we all have different body types & live different lifestyles, but I guarantee that if we were educated on how normal (& common) these features are & saw diverse bodies of all sizes, shapes, colours, disabilities, etc being represented & accepted, I think the amount of women & men who struggle with their body image would be so much lower. 

Can you just imagine how the -year-old version of yourself would've felt if Britney Spears was on the front cover, cellulite & all, EXCEPT with a positive, uplifting headline about how happy she looks, rather than tearing down the PERFECTLY NORMAL cellulite on her legs? (Swipe across to see the cover I'm talking about 👉🏻)

The more we see it, the more we normalise it… So while the reality may not be embraced in magazines, you can still choose what you consume online. So curate your feed carefully! Opt in for content that leaves you feeling better, not worse 🌟

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

It's VERY likely they:

🦵 have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, smaller waist etc)
🦴 have a different bone structure 
🧬 have a different genetic makeup
🏋🏻‍♀️ lead different lifestyles which can lead to a completely different body composition 
🤳🏻 post posed & perfected photos for social media (like these examples above)
📱 possibly even edit their photos before posting, etc
🙅‍♀️ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self 
🤷🏻‍♀️ OR maybe they did achieve it in a healthy way, but those same habits may not = the same body for you or be sustainable for you.

Either way, you will NEVER be content in your skin UNTIL you stop giving your inner critic all the power & start actively trying to be gentler with yourself. You are not in competition with anyone else, you're in your own lane, one of a kind, and it's not fair to compare your behind-the-scenes self to someone else's highlight reel. I hope reminders like these slowly chip away & help you with all of that! 🙏🏼 

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours? 👀 Leave a “❤️‍🩹” if you do & a “❤️‍🔥” if you don't. Let's be honest besties.

Your best body is the one you have when you're looking after yourself both mentally & physically, when you're living a balanced life tailored to your physical AND mental well-being. However that “looks” on you is the least important part 💛

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

🌟 Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
🌟 Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
🌟 LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world 🥹 I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same… Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
🌟 Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
🌟 Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you… 
🌟 If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key 🥰
🌟 At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us 💅 It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible 🫶

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks 💗

Just because you appreciate one, doesn't mean you can't appreciate the other. And it's the same deal for each and every one of us. Despite what we've been brought up to believe, there's not just one type of beautiful. 

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that today could be the day you decide to kickstart your health journey to reach your “body goals” after a weekend of simply ✨ ENJOYING YO LIFE ✨ and there's nothing wrong with working on yourself, but I'll just leave this here every Monday to remind you that a woman who works out regularly, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle can have belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, and doesn't always look as toned and fit as she may appear online. So next time you question your self-worth when comparing yourself to someone you idolise online, remember this:

If we base our self-worth on something as ever-changing as our bodies, we will forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession and shame. 

So I hope these weekly doses of reality help with that. The more we see normal women with normal bodies, the more realistic our expectations will be, and then hopefully more of us will start to accept ourselves too 💛

Doc ID: 2490, distribution: 0.9498194330594267 ; There are more than  MILLION results when you search for “how to get rid of belly fat” on Google.
More than  MILLION when you search “how to get rid of loose skin”
More than  million for “how to get rid of stretch marks”
More than  million for “how to get rid of cellulite”
More than  million for “how to get rid of hip dips”
The list goes on. [ad]

It's ingrained in us to want to get rid of these things. Do you have to LOVE them? No of course not, but these features are human.

Let's approach them one by one…

Belly fat: a layer of fat is vital for a healthy, functioning, fertile body. It's essential that the human body has some, you would not function without it. It serves to absorb vitamins, store energy, protect & insulate your body. 

Loose skin: is due to your skin stretching at some point… It will likely tighten up again slowly over time depending on how much you have. It's not something to be ashamed of, it's something to be in awe of!

Stretch marks: AKA a beautiful purple/pink scar that shows you how much you've grown. Almost everyone will have stretch marks at least once in their lives as we all go through a growth spurt from child to adult.

Cellulite: more women have cellulite because the structure of our connective tissue is different to men, which causes our skin to dimple where theirs doesn't (as much).

Hip dips: the appearance of hip dips is due to your BONE structure & the shape of your pelvis. If all of us could see our skeletons, we would see an indentation where the hip bone meets the top of the thigh.

(Even those who appear to not have any of them, most likely do!!)

Here's a proud video of mine, along with showing you how easy it can be to “hide” these things online which is why we don't see them very often, but I promise you are definitely not the only one with them 🌟

The more we see it, the more we normalise it 🥰

lox bagel sammie (getting lox to add to my bagels for the week always feels like such a treat! add cream cheese, red onion, or whatever fix ins you like)

winter salad (greens tossed in olive oil, acv, maple syrup, and s+p w/ roasted brussel sprouts, roasted butternut squash, pan-seared chicken, turkey bacon, beets, and goat cheese)

steak and veggie stir fry with rice (steak marinated in soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, cornstarch, sugar, garlic powder, and salt)

burrito bowl w/ whatever protein, veggies, and flavors you like (the easiest mexican-inspired shredded chicken requires just  ingredients- chicken and salsa. add chicken and a jar of salsa to a slow cooker, cook on low for - hours, and shred)

protein oats (a bfast favorite of mine. i like to add vanilla protein to mine and top w/ frozen blueberries, dark chocolate chips, and nut butter)

lemon alfredo pasta w/ spinach and seared scallops (a fun switch up from my typical pasta w/ red sauce. sear scallops in a mix of avocado oil and butter for  min on one side and  min on the other)

avocado toast (a classic. i highly recommend the san francisco style sourdough bread from trader joe's. i topped mine w/ sea salt, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of evoo)

instant ramen w/ - min eggs and wilted spinach and baby kale (i like to make my own sauce with soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, sesame oil, and honey)

roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, and butternut squash paired w/ air-fried chicken breast and goat cheese (this is a super easy meal that can be prepped ahead of time. veggies roasted at  degrees for about  min and chicken air-fried at  degrees for  min)

broccoli and kale slaw salad w/ pan-fried tofu (no shame in using salad kits for convenience! the broccoli and kale slaw from trader joe's is one of my favorites. i toss my tofu in soy sauce, paprika, and garlic powder, and i like to have a side of bread for balance and satisfaction)

i've been loving these roasted sweet potato & crispy tofu hummus bowls for easy dinners this week. they're so simple yet flavorful and leave me full and satisfied (until dessert of course 😚 ). there's no true recipe for this dish since it really is so easy and intuitive, but i'll leave some general tips below.

hope you save this post so we can twin on dinners this week!

details:

- some of the veggies here are roasted and some are steamed (just based my preference for each one). i start with the roasted veggies since these take the most time (sweet potatoes and zucchini tossed in olive oil and spices, roasted for - min at F)
- while those are roasting, i diced up my tofu and toss it with olive oil, spices, miso paste, and coconut aminos. i roast that for - min at F as well)
- next i make my classic hummus dressing. just a ton of hummus mixed with enough water to thin haha. so easy!
- onto the steamed veggies— i love cauliflower and broccoli steamed more than i do roasted. i steam each one in the microwave with some spices. i do  min and  seconds for the broccoli and  minutes for the cauliflower.
- i also steam my kale base because i'm too lazy to massage it sometimes haha. i do this in the microwave too, for about  min and  seconds (you don't want this to start cooking or it'll dry out)
- once the roasted veggies are done assemble your bowl with the kale base, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, sweet potatoes, hummus dressing, and feta of course
- you can always use vegan feta or omit it altogether if you don't eat dairy! i'm mostly plant based but i LOVE feta cheese so i can never cut it out hahaha

you deserve to live a really truly happy life, and to do that, you have to learn to let go because where energy goes, energy flows. letting go of anything can be really hard because how things already are may feel safe, and with most loss, there's a sense of grief that comes with it. but, i promise you that the things and people that only add negativity to your life are not worth holding onto, and there is so much life beyond what you're used to that will open up to you when you make the space for it.

in order to keep moving forward, we need to let go of the energy that is no longer meant for us and free ourselves from the chains that are holding us back. your life won't be empty, your life will be open, open to receiving more opportunities, building healthier relationships, creating positivity, receiving calm energy, and becoming fuller than it ever was before.

pay attention to who you are and how you feel when you're around people. the wrong people may make you feel shrunken down and anxious. the right people soothe your soul and allow you to be your authentic self.

it's okay to take a step back or disappear for awhile even if that means disappointing others or taking a break from things you love. prioritize yourself. the world can wait.

even when you feel broken, everything you need to feel whole is within yourself, not others. other people can add happiness to your life, but don't let them be the primary source of it.

not everything goes as planned, and that is okay. allow yourself to find grace and peace in the midst of chaos and uncertainty. be patient with the timing of your journey.

just because it feels like you might be going backwards doesn't mean that you are. allow yourself to think of your journey as a spiral, not a circle. even if it feels like you're starting over, this time you are starting with more experience.

the past couple years, i've made my main intention ~letting go~, and this year was the year i was truly able to feel the internal shifts happening within me.

one of the hardest parts about letting go for me was that it can take longer (sometimes a lot longer) to let go of thoughts than it is of actions. just because i had stopped harmful behaviors didn't mean i wasn't fighting an internal battle that in many ways felt even harder and more painful than the initial fight to change my actions.

not enough people tell you that the healing often hurts a lot more than the breaking,

right now, i eat double the amount of food i used to think i “should” to MAINTAIN my weight, which is absolutely absurd.  but, it's not just me. there are sooo many people, especially young women, who are UNDEREATING- by a lot.  i get asked a lot about how to increase your metabolism or how i'm able to eat “so much”, and my answer is to TRUST your body and allow some time for your body to trust you. trust is a two way street, and you need to trust that your body isn't packing on  pounds of fat in a week from an increase in food (it's probably mostly a result of water retention, hormones, + stress), and you need to be consistent with increasing food intake, so that your body can trust that you won't deprive it again.

Doc ID: 16015, distribution: 0.8104068815673984 ; Even though my half marathon is cancelled 😭 I'm determined to see the training schedule out to its finish. Here's yesterday's run and today's run - I'm very much in need of a rest day tomorrow! Yesterday's run was a steady pace for hr  and then  mins fast and  mins very fast (plus warm up and cool down). Today's run was just  mins steady pace. I listened to a podcast instead of music for the first time while running, and was pleased to find I could concentrate on it pretty well. I have actually got pretty good at running and don't know in what way I will carry it on when this training cycle is over. Maybe I'll follow a new training schedule to improve my km time. I've really loved checking each run off on my garmin and looking back at my stats for each run.

Doc ID: 16174, distribution: 0.7772131005496576 ; Two-run-Saturday   I've been for two runs today. I didn't plan it that way, but I went to parkrun (got a PB, yay!!) and then came home and looked at the weather forecast because I heard rumours of a big STORM approaching. Seriously looks like it's going to be hard to even stay upright never mind run, so in the afternoon after I'd done an hour of maths tutoring, I popped back out to do my  minute “easy run”. It is easy, it's at a very steady pace, I just put my headphones on and trot along enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. So now, run done and tomorrow can be a rest day with all the wind and rain from Storm Ciara. I think it might still be bad on Monday when I am scheduled to run, but I will deal with that when we get there.

We can get the girls to play card games, UNO, and also a game with tiles called Quirkle. Even H is not so keen when there's only me and him, even though he will happily play with our group of friends on a Friday night. It's easy to get lazy about game playing though…. when I play online I can have played a whole game in the time it would take to just set up the board and pieces for an in person game. There is something nice and more satisfying about handling the physical pieces and cards of an actual game though.

Doc ID: 17229, distribution: 0.7437176650788775 ; Melllllting   Oh my goodness what a hot day it's been! H got up at .am as he had to go to London for work. The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

Topic 8 : 
top terms: therapy, session, bit, therapist, felt, talking, last, end, parents, talk
amin: fused topic; half about therapy sessions and half about child fostering (QA)

Doc ID: 16186, distribution: 0.9096027721451434 ; Therapy .. // attachment intro  T asked her usual question from when one topic comes to an end - “So, where to now?” I looked at my list. I can't decide whether I want to plunge into this next big area for therapy or not. Do I want to open this up? “We-ell…. I have stuff written down…. it's just hard to start talking about it.” “Is it one topic or more than one?” We chat a bit about why I wouldn't want to talk about it. I tell T that maybe I don't want to because it's *effort*. That makes her smIle, “Hasn't the whole of therapy been effort?” Then I tell her all my usual things, that I can't decide where to start, that I can't work out how to get it all said in a nice order. This is nothing new. T reminds me to just start by pulling a thread out and we will follow that thread and see where it goes. Eventually I get going. “Uh so you know that screenshot I sent you? from the Why Love Matters book? So I've had that book for ages on my kindle, but I decided I'd buy an actual paper copy of it. I ordered it on Amazon, and then amazon starts showing you all these other books which are related to what you've bought, so it started showing me all these attachment theory books. And I was looking through them using the Look Inside feature. I found some bits that I really related to and I screenshotted them.” I pause. I don't know what to do now. I sit and ponder and T sits quietly and waits and then I continue. “So…. I'm wondering now what to do with the screenshots, whether to read them out or send them to you…” T asked “How many screenshots do you have?” “Three” T said “So while you were talking just now, I was thinking… why don't I get my phone and you can send me the first one? Then we can have a look at it.” “Oh, yeah ok” I send her the first screenshot on WhatsApp. I'm glad we can do this. If we met in the same room, I could just show her these things. But with us being over Skype, we have to be a bit creative about how we share things between us. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15198, distribution: 0.9073366097150829 ; Question: Why did you skip two grades? Answer: The first year I skipped was year . I went to a really small primary school and there wasn't enough space in the classroom for us all. So the three oldest of us moved up to the other classroom and worked with the year above. At the end of that year, our parents decided whether we carried on with the year above or repeated the year. My parents decided I should carry on with the year above (the other two repeated the year).The second year I skipped was year  (final year of primary school). That was my parents decision, as I was already working a year ahead and I had finished all the maths work that the school had. My parents must have requested it but I don't know the details of how it was negotiated. I remember an educational psychologist coming out and doing an assessment with me. I was only  so it's all a bit hazy memories.I was just bright…. I guess these days it would be called “gifted and talented”…. and I had parents (well, my mum really, I think my dad just went along with it) who overvalued academic achievement. Also my Gran moved up a year at school and my mum moved up a year at school so there was a bit of an inheritance I suppose. However it stopped with me because there's no way I would move my children ahead of their age group. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16225, distribution: 0.9025823382456208 ; Question: Is this public school for D? Do they let you change schools anytime or only in extenuating circumstances? Or is she now enrolled in private school?  Answer: Ah so i think this is not from a UK follower, since in the UK public schools are also private. (Confusing and nonsensical, I know)Anyway, d was in a “public” school which we call a comprehensive school. And she's now moved to a different comprehensive school, in a Managed Move done between the two schools. This means the schools have coordinated it between themselves. It's only done in extenuating circumstances. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 14561, distribution: 0.8932021172809819 ; Question: Are you willing to share how and when you became involved in fostering and if your husband also wanted to foster? Answer: We had our three children, the youngest was , and I started thinking about a fourth baby. H wasn't sure about four children and it took me a few months to talk him round. After he finally agreed, I started worrying that four children might tip us over the edge and it would have been me that pushed us into it. Around the same time, we got talking to some friends of ours who foster, and thought that was something we could do. So we looked into it and it seemed so right. I could still get my baby fix and H could stop panicking about the costs of raising four children. We went to an initial introduction to fostering meeting, and that started the whole process off. A year later we were welcoming our first foster baby. We absolutely love fostering and have never regretted our choice ❤️ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16512, distribution: 0.8924957454863787 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15020, distribution: 0.8902496635429893 ; Question: Who is H? How many babies have you fostered? Could you ever adopt any of them? Answer: H is my husband (H for husband!) We've fostered  babies and no we haven't ever had the option to adopt any of them. Fostering babies in the UK doesn't generally lead into adoption by the fostering family. The usual outcome is either reunification with birth family or adoption by adopters who are already assessed and waiting. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16034, distribution: 0.8857616038771843 ; Question: why does baby get contact with mom if shes in foster care? is it only for babies or for older foster kids too?  Answer: All children have the right to a family life through the Human Rights Act. This means even if they are brought into foster care, they have the legal right to continue to have a relationship with their birth family unless or until there is good reason to stop this. This applies to all children of all ages. When children have arranged contact with their birth family, this right to family life is protected (even though arranged contact may not be what everyone views as 'family life').Baby will continue to have supervised contact with her birth mum until a ruling is made by the court abut her future. Imagine if there was no contact, and then the court found six months later (the standard minimum length of family court proceedings in the UK) that mum was able to safely parent her baby. By then mum and baby wouldn't have seen each other for  months and the relationship would have been severely damaged. Contact can also form a very useful part of the parenting assessment, which contributes to the court's final decision.Newborn babies typically have relatively large amounts of contact with their birth parents -  hours, three or four times a week. This helps preserve their relationship in the critical early months of life until a court ruling has been made. Older children in care of the local authority have varying amounts of contact depending on the circumstances, but very rarely as frequent as newborns. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15234, distribution: 0.8821453904969994 ; Therapy .. // endings  T brought the conversation back round to endings, as she had made a note in her diary previously for us to talk about it this week. We aren't talking about the practical details of imminent termination but I think T is working on a drip drip approach with the topic. She said she is going to bring it up once a month. I am finding that I am gradually managing to stay more present in conversations about ending therapy. Previously I would shut down completely at the mention of it, then there was a session just into the start of lockdown when T said she was now planning to retire in the next couple of years, and I felt myself going to that shutdown place and I fought against it and managed to stay mostly present. Since then we've talked about it twice more I think. My window of tolerance for staying with the topic is enlarging gradually. T always reminds me that she is not leaving yet, and that we will have a steady phase out of sessions over many months, not just a sudden end date. (Of course this is dependent on nothing unexpected occurring in her life or mine that forces us to stop therapy early. I am a little bit scared of that happening. It's one of the few positives to ending therapy that I can see, being in control of the end rather than having it suddenly pushed on us.) She asked me how the two week break had gone. I looked down and fidgeted a bit and then said “It was like part of me is like the baby when I go out of the room, she cries because she thinks I've gone forever. And then another part of me is like me in the other room, calling back through to the baby that I'm still here… So there's part of me that's wailing and crying and feeling abandoned because you're not here, and then there's another part that's saying it's ok, T is coming back, she hasn't disappeared, she hasn't left you…” T waited a moment to check I'd finished speaking, and then she said “That's really good, Faith! It shows you're learning to parent yourself now. That was something you couldn't do before.” I responded that it was one thing to do it now, when I knew she was coming back, but what will I do after we have ended therapy? There won't be that reassurance then. T said that maybe we can continue to do three monthly check-ins after we've officially ended. I don't know if she was saying that off the top of her head, I hope she has thought it through if so, because it feels a big thing to me. I would love to keep the connection and be able to check in every so often. I can see a parallel here with the way we say goodbye to our foster babies, and it makes me sad - but I'll keep that for another post.

Doc ID: 16029, distribution: 0.8818350245956027 ; Question: do the moms ever change their minds about putting the babies in foster care after they get all that contact? are they able to do that or is it more like a court decision?  Answer: Ok I forgot when I wrote my last answer that I think foster care very few babies in the UK are relinquished (given up voluntarily by their birth parents). If they are relinquished, the birth parents have more choice in the contact until the court decision is finalised - they mostly decide they don't want any.The babies who come into foster care are usually because social care has judged that there are significant concerns over the birth parents ability to care for the baby. When the baby is born, social care will go to court and apply for an interim care order. This means they have the power to remove the baby from the birth parents and place them in foster care. It is almost always done against the birth parents will.There is then a  week assessment period during which the parents and any family members who wish to be considered for full time care of the baby are assessed. During this period, contact with the baby will take place as I said in my previous answer, about  hours three or four times a week - the amount is decided by the court and social care have to abide by it. The parents do not always manage to attend all the contact sessions, sometimes I think seeing their baby in those circumstances knowing what the future likely holds becomes too emotionally difficult for them, and so the contact sessions may be reduced or stopped by the court if there is reason.After the assessments are complete, social care go back to court with their evidence and a recommendation for either reunification with the birth parents, or adoption. Other people make their recommendation too. The birth parents have a solicitor who speaks up on their behalf. The judge makes a final decision on the baby's future. If the decision is for adoption, the birth parents contact is tapered down, they may go down to one session a week, then one a fortnight, then one a month and then a final goodbye contact. Once a baby is adopted, the birth parents generally have very minimal contact with them. They may meet the adoptive family once before the adoption if it's felt that's a positive meeting. After that they likely only have letterbox contact once a year (exchanging letters and updates via a third party).

Quite proud of myself actually for making it through the week without too much obsessing or wailing.  T is back next Tuesday so we will have a session, and then the Tuesday after we are away on holiday again so I haven't decided what I'm going to do about that session. When we talked about endings a few weeks ago, T made a note in her diary that we would revisit the topic in the session after the break. I am not too enthusiastic about that.

i wish the people that hurt me the most would see the scars on my wrists 

 the ppl that hurt u the most would look at the scars on ur wrist indifferently, lets be real pals. people dont feel sorry for the shit, especially neurotypical people. they never have and they never will - especially if they're treating you, yano, how you say they are. ive been made fun of for my scars for my whole life, and been told to ADD MORE by the people i care about the most. they really *dont* care.  stop pitying yourself, and stop expecting pity. seeing scars isnt going to make anyone feel bad or think twice about the way they treat you. ultimately when you hurt YOURSELF -you're only hurting YOURSELF. the people who were careless enough to hurt you don give a fuck theyll laugh n scoff in ya face n thats some real shit sorry

 Fellow ed people  Please don't give each other tips on how to purge. It's super dangerous and addictive. And even if you would get out of the purging? Do it long enough and there you go: scared you will die if you throw up once after drinking too much. Or die if you get ill and throw up. Because everytime you throw up there is blood. Doesn't mather you haven't purged in a year. There is blood. You will not die pretty and thin. You will die face on the toilet, stomach literally exploded and only thing keeping your insides in is your skin. And that skin? It's purple because yeah well your stomach just exploded. Teeth gone, hair gone, nails gone. And your face is buffy and bruised no mather what the scale says.  Just. Don't. Give. Tips.

Doc ID: 10943, distribution: 0.9218412501304575 ; Highlights from 🇹🇭 Railay 🇹🇭 featuring Matthew's two favourite things: monkeys and napping 😴😂🐒
-
Just before I bring you guys lots of content from Scotland (😉), let's talk Thailand . . . again!!! So welcome to Railay, which was honestly stunningggg 🤩 It's not an island, but you can only access by boat so we got a long tail boat out from Ao Nang and visited as a day trip 🏝
-
You can of course stay on Railay itself, but it is more expensive than the mainland. Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our £ a night hotel room . . . £ you guys!!! 😱 It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)👌🏻
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay 👏🏻
-
🇹🇭 Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you 🙈 They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
🇹🇭 Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point 😆 . . .
-
🇹🇭 The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up 😂 It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great 😅
-
🇹🇭 I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing 🤨 There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country 😍 Please please visit 💚✨

I'm all here for the adventure!!! I mean, I am starting to question why I've signed myself up to do certain things, but I'm starting to realise that I'm verrrrrry very good at turning pretty much anything into a fun, spicy adventure 🌶🌍
-

You need to start seeing it as a choice, because it's the only way you'll be able to choose differently imo. It is a choice. % everything you put in your body is your choice.  Answer: It is a choice, but just because it's a choice doesn't mean it easy to make it. It would be a choice to jump out of a plane to do a skydive, but that doesn't mean I could do it. It would be a choice for you to come off anon and reveal yourself, but you're not choosing to do that.Some choices are easier to make than others, depending on all sorts of things — external and internal factors. Circumstances can make it hard to make choices that in different circumstances we would find more easy to make. Currently I'm in a time with a lot of difficult circumstances. I'm trying to keep my explanation simple here so that even you with your apparent  staggering lack of compassion might be able to grasp it.

  I told a therapist once that I wished I could fix my broken brain and stop all the self-destructive noise, and responding by telling me that my brain is reacting exactly as it should be given my trauma history. I started crying because for so long I had thought that there was something wrong with me. I was always the sick one, the one who couldn't stop self-destructing, the one who was broken. Except I wasn't.  She told me that while it feels incredibly frustrating to deal with panic attacks or dissociation or flashbacks, and it gets incredibly tiring having to tell myself that yes, we are going to eat today, my brain is actually responding in a really healthy manner. It's simply trying to protect me post-trauma. My brain has always been trying to protect me, and that helps somehow on the hard days. It helps to know that despite my brain leaning towards maladaptive ways of survival, it is simply because it doesn't know that we're not in original circumstances anymore when that was needed to disconnect. It is still desperately trying to get me through the hard stuff.   I'm now learning how to orient myself to the present, to send signals to my system that we are safe now, and to teach my brain that it doesn't need to protect me in that same way anymore. But I'm also grateful - although that may sound strange - at how cool it is that my brain is THAT hard-wired to survive. It's kind of beautiful to think about actually, at least in the moments when my head is above water. So here's to not being angry at myself when a symptoms pops up that interferes with my life. Instead, here's to compassion and gratitude at the way my brain is trying to help.

Doc ID: 12257, distribution: 0.7037630234707837 ; Good takeaways from “Understanding the Paradox of Surviving Childhood Trauma” by Joanne Zucchetto (mostly aimed at clinicians, but good info nonetheless): • so much of this comes back to attachment - kids depend on their caregiver(s) to survive so their brain can't allow them to know the full extent of the harm and protects the attachment figure (to know the full extent of the harm & their powerlessness would mean annihilation) –> so they often disconnect from body / emotions to survive and use self-destructive behaviors to do so • self-destructive behaviors are the brain's way of forming a defense against the harm
 • to make meaning out of the harm, kids often blame themselves & take on their parents' badness (ie: if I'm bad, I did something wrong, therefore it makes more sense) 
 • instead of telling someone “No, you're good / not worthless / not to blame!” trying to understand how that defense has functioned to help them survive trauma

Doc ID: 12303, distribution: 0.6738805372071911 ; Also - screw it - while we're talking about treatment experiences, here's my review of Renfrew (the Brentwood, TN location). Prepare yourselves, it's bad. This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).  A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.  On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode. I'm sure she was great therapist and very skilled at her job, but because of my religious PTSD, my brain coded her as unsafe and I was unable to talk to her or open up.  I told them I couldn't work with her - I tried to advocate for myself because I know my brain. The psychiatric provider told me I needed to learn to work through that and that that was the actual issue, that I needed to learn to work with Christian therapists. SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT after I had just said that I grew up in a Christian cult and have PTSD from that. My issue was not the harm they caused, but being unable to work with Christian therapists… Well about  weeks into my stay, I have a breakdown because I've been off my antidepressants for weeks and no one has been monitoring my meds. I asked - no, BEGGED, to talk to someone because I was feeling desperate. The therapist on site told me that “maybe now just isn't the best time for treatment” and maybe I needed to hit rock bottom first. I walked away feeling even more desperate.  The entire time when I was struggling with trauma symptoms (dissociating a lot, having panic attacks) I was told that I was being avoidant and resistant and just wasn't motivated enough, even though I was giving it all I had.  A friend of mine, another patient, was literally sent to a room by herself when she couldn't finish a meal, even though that replicated traumatic punishments she had as a child (she told me all of this and I told her if they made her do it again I would come sit with her so she wouldn't be alone).  They don't teach coping skills either? Everything is labeled avoidance (music, writing, any “healthy” coping skills is avoidance unless you just sit and feel the emotion). That may sound innocent enough until you bring trauma into the equation, in which just “sitting with” the traumatic emotions / thoughts is not how you heal and in fact may be re-traumatizing.  I was also constantly made to feel like I was the problem. The approach was extremely punitive. One of the head dietitians, who was not on my team, threatened on my second to last day that if I didn't finish a meal, they might discharge me early. I told her I was about to discharge in two days, and she said, “Well, we might make it tomorrow instead.” I was already anxious enough, and I don't respond well to ultimatums or threats (who does?), which were really common there. All of that to say: they are NOT equipped to treat trauma, no matter what they advertise.  EDITED to add: I've written reviews on Yelp and Google, if you want to “like” them ;)

Doc ID: 19267, distribution: 0.6714342551767402 ; Day  was really really hard for me.

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 12464, distribution: 0.6691470754438321 ; Something no one told me about trauma was that I learned a lot of unhealthy, toxic behavior patterns as a way of survival and self-protection, and as a result, I hurt a lot of people. Owning my actions has been a process, and I'm recognizing how those patterns helped me for time, but no longer serve. It's been painful to look back and see how my actions have harmed others, even while those actions were ways of trying to find safety and protect myself because of the trauma. It's not a matter of beating myself for the things I've done to try to survive - that helps no one. But now that I know better, I can do better. I can become aware of what triggers my brain to code someone as unsafe and act in self-protection, and once I'm aware, I can move towards doing something different. I can do my part in attempting to mend the relationships that I've broken.  My brain sometimes registers threats where there are none because of the trauma, and while my brain is trying to be helpful, it usually has me acting against my values as a way to keep myself safe from the perceived threat.  Trauma recovery isn't fun, you guys. There was a period of my life that I did a lot of things that I am not proud of. But to truly move towards wholeness, I have to do a lot of self-reflection and take ownership for my actions that are not in line with my values  (balanced with understanding the function of those actions + giving myself grace for doing my best at the time). And you know what? I've found that it hasn't led to me hating myself more, but rather to more empathy for people who maybe are struggling to survive as well.

“i took time to recharge.”

the thing is...

...life is too short to restrict your body before every summer, after every holiday, before every night out, after every spontaneous food run, before every event, after every celebration, before every vacation, and after every time you eat more than you ~think~ you should...

...life is too short to spend all of it constantly worrying about the next thing, ruminating on the past, and always living from a place of fear and anxiety...

...life is too short to let it all pass you by because the nonsense you were taught trapped you in fear...

...life is too short to not live as you are. right now. to the maximum. 

i spent a lot of years constantly chasing a goal, but during those years, i rarely if ever chose to embrace myself in the moment, and that breaks my heart. so yeah, i'm going on vacation in two days but i haven't been spending my energy trying to “get my body ready” for it because . our bodies are ALWAYS ready to experience life, and . there's still life to be lived, experienced, and enjoyed leading up to my vacation, so i sure as heck am not gonna miss out on that because i'm busy waiting and worrying about the next thing.

i know it might sound extremely hypocritical because i HAVE a degree… 

but i've learned that there are MANY paths to success that don't require formal education. 

entrepreneurship, skilled trades, & creative fields are just a few examples of success that can be achieved without going to university.

some of the most successful people i know don't have a degree. 

👀some of the most successful people i know DO have a degree (or multiple)!!

👀👀and some of the most successful people i know who have degrees aren't working in that respective field

the problem is NOT the degree, higher education, status, etc. 

the problem is that we are forced to choose our “forever path” at the mere age of /, when we barely know ourselves! 

and then after undergrad, we “might as well” commit a few more years in a masters/doctorate degree. with little space to breathe or explore who we are outside of school. 

the problem is the shame of taking gap years, trade schools, or any other sort of “break” that can allow an individual to discover their strengths, passions, talents, etc. 

the problem is when we feel like we don't have the freedom to choose. as a double aquarius♒️, freedom is a strong core value. 

i want to make it clear that i'm not ANTI education, im ANTI being-forced-into-something-believing-it-is- the-only-path-to-success.

doing things without intention or purpose? no thanks!

the world is changing. you have options. 

if you got thrown through the education machine, got a “job” for the sake of it & need some help centering your life and actions around purpose…. 

i created my program for women just like you. the women i work with up-level their quality of life by gaining clarity on their big purpose, dropping their limiting beliefs, and building confidence with their inner voices and forward motion. 

📲Im only taking a few slots for my upcoming round in april. If you feel curious or even ready to take the next steps in taking charge of your life- let's chat!

Doc ID: 8648, distribution: 0.8718642399837283 ; i know that it's scary to try something new. 

i know that there are so many possibilities:

what if i fail?

what if i don't actually end up liking it?

what if i go through all of that and realize i don't want to do it anyway?

but there's also a possibility that you end up loving your life. 

there's a possibility that you'd create a life you're excited to wake up to everyday, knowing what you're here to do. 

if that's a possible outcome of just trying something ~different~

it might be worth that risk.

Doc ID: 8667, distribution: 0.8693691731155959 ; Are you looking for the next best thing?

The thing to take you to the next level?

The course that will teach you how to be better?

The certification that will solve all your problems?

The program that will guide you to all your answers?

If you are… let's pause all the looking 👀OUTWARD and bring your attention ➡️inward⬅️

If there are any outstanding tasks, chores, items on your list that you've been holding off on, that's your work.

The things you've been avoiding out of fear or discomfort?

That's your work.

All those ⬆️ above totally can bring you to the next level 

AND also calling your mom more often can elevate your life in such a nourishing way.

Sticking to an exercise program (that you probably already bought but never finished) can get you to a whole other level.

So if you've been reaching for things outside yourself to level up,

Maybe it's time to reach within. And work on your basics.

Doc ID: 8679, distribution: 0.8673126291017849 ; i would NEVER have imagined that i would willingly choose to: not go to med school, live with my parents (lol), and be a coach??

 year old me was ambitious, determined, hard working, and so studious, she would just tell me to shut up if i went back in time and told her what i was doing.

she had PLANS to change the world. and i love her for that.

the problem was that i  tied my identity, worthiness, and capabilities to those plans. 

and when the plans started to feel less exciting (internal compass started shifting), i felt so alone and lost.

thankfully, i found my path once again.

i learned that being “on my path” is not dependent on any one thing that i've accomplished

but more so the intention of my creations

my purpose.

so it didn't matter that my life “measures” at  didn't match the life that i planned or expected.

what mattered at the end is that i was brave enough to be true to myself.

and i know you are, too.

an exciting, fulfilling life is available for anyone willing to do the inner work & let go of these things: ⬇️

❌not leaning into and sharing your passions

❌believing that making the “wrong” choice will ruin everything 

❌feeling unworthy of your deepest desires

❌thinking you need to do something you don't enjoy forever

❌not allowing yourself to imagine an exciting life

a life you love is not dependent on your income, your job status, your living situation, your current phase of life, etc. 

you can be living your purpose as you clock into your -

you can be living your purpose as you work on a project until  am 

you can be living your purpose as you call your bestie & tell her about your day

Just believe these thoughts ⬆️
👀 are % true for you, and don't try to work through them!

This is actually a big reason why we stay stuck… 

But if you want to get unstuck, start by disproving those claims.

Unravel all the things that tell you it's not possible for you and prove 👏🏼them👏🏼wrong👏🏼

Tell your fears, doubts, and worries that you are here to bring more to the world. You are meant to.

If you need help doing this, I walk my clients step-by-step through dropping their current stories (that keep them stuck in the same spot, or possibly running in circles, spinning their wheels) & rewriting their stories so they can finally be ✨HER✨

Send me a DM “PURPOSE” for more info & i'll send you a link to my coaching program!

Doc ID: 8651, distribution: 0.8341015426639243 ; I've said it before & i'll say it again and probably more after this…

Your process IS your progress.

Whatever you work on for yourself today is ultimately part of that big goal, that dream life, that big vision.

You really have all the things you need to get started today.

We look for so much external validation to tell us that we're going in the right direction,

To tell us that we've “progressed,”

When we ALSO can internally validate ourselves.

You don't have  to wait until you land that dream job that checks every box for you, feels fulfilling, and that also makes you enough money to live life comfortably and go on  vacations a year.

(this is possible for you BTW)

Did you go on that walk today? Did you speak kindly to yourself today? Did you make the effort to go to bed earlier today?

You make your own measures, your own goals. 

once you stop striving for “progress” and start enjoying the focus on your “process,”

You'll see your life flourish.

You got this. I love you.
