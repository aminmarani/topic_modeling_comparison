 “similarly to not blaming folks for where they are when a system placed them there, we can use a strengths-based approach with people in our lives. relaxing isn't always possible. same with letting go. so instead of telling people to “just relax” or “just let go” we can gently wonder, and even ask: what about this is scary or challenging? can i see the wisdom in the not-relaxing, in the tight holding? ⊹ this wondering can help us see where another person is, why they are there (even if it's just: oh they don't feel safe to relax. they can't “just let go.” i now see it's not that simple), the strength in their choices (as well as the choiceless choices. see: yesterday's post), and supports they might need. ⊹ there is so much i could say about this, and i will. ⊹ like how: there is often deep wisdom and strength in the ways we cope, even while the ways we cope can feel disruptive to our lives. ⊹ like how: this relates to bodywork and touchbased modalities, and how practitioners can honor the tightness, the holding and muscle guarding as protective not defective.”

I think being able to trust her enough to tell her all my fears, even though I know they sound wildly irrational, and have her treat them kindly and gently has made such a difference. I've been seized by overwhelming waves of fear and then just as one passed and that fear settled, another one came up to take its place. T helped me work through all of them and now when I think back, although I can remember how all-consuming each fear felt in the moment then, now each one seems like nothing to worry about.  I hope I've grown some new neural pathways for dealing with situations like this one. I feel hopeful that in the future if (when) another situation occurs which feels overwhelming, I'll be able to stay in a more adult frame of mind and remember this experience and T's words. I'm so grateful for her. I sent her a text that said “Thankyou for helping me through it x” and she sent me a ❤️ back. I feel so cared for and (sorry) warm and fuzzy.

Doc ID: 2531, distribution: 0.8638660853172053 ; A very Merry Christmas photo dump 🎄 because life is too short to spend another Christmas at war with yourself 🥲

These photos remind me of how many incredible moments you can create with the people you love when you're no longer putting such an unnecessary pressure on yourself, when you're not avoiding the feasts or turning down the photos or allowing the feelings of guilt to overwhelm you.

I'll be honest, I still experience some subconscious feelings of guilt after overeating every now & then, it's something I've experienced from a young age but those feelings have definitely lessened over the past few years since I've started focusing on the way my body FEELS (my overall health & happiness) rather than the way my body LOOKS. I know deep-down that I have nothing to feel guilty about, so I've been ignoring those subconscious feelings of guilt, pushing past them, being gentler with myself & enjoying lots of incredible food anyway!!! WE'VE GOT THIS 💪🏼

So this post is for you, but also for me, to remind you to be gentler to yourself today (& every day). If you've eaten a lot today & you're starting to be unkind to yourself, I just wanted to remind you that you deserve food. You deserve to enjoy feasting on Christmas Day. You deserve to be present. Your body won't transform overnight & even if it did (which it won't) that's okay!!! There's nothing wrong with that. You DON'T deserve to be hard on yourself. Enjoy today, if you can. And if nothing else today makes you smile, I hope this will….

I love you. Merry Christmas 🎄💛

Doc ID: 9747, distribution: 0.556897078107438 ; i feel like the concept of mindfulness has a stigma of being a bit “woo woo” if you know what i mean.  when i used to think of mindfulness, i solely thought of things such as meditation and yoga, eating slowly and in silence, and being environmentally sustainable. now, i realize that although living mindfully can include those things, it doesn't always have to and is also so much more.

living mindfully to me means living with intention whatever that means for you. it's not an all or nothing thing, and mindful living, just like healthy living, looks different person to person because it's about knowing your own personal why and keeping it in mind when making decisions.

for me, mindfulness includes:
pausing and thinking before reacting,
eating things I actually want to eat,
taking time to slow down,
doing things for my community,
moving my body from a place of gratitude,
seeking out things that make me feel fulfilled,
and showing compassion.

my intentions? to be happy, live freely, and have an impact.

.
it's been an enemy of mine for some time now. you would think working full time with a  hour round trip commute every day would make hitting the pillow extremely easy. i wish! even if i'm terribly exhausted, falling and staying asleep are struggles for me. im constantly looking for new ways to enhance my abilities to fall asleep as well as the quality of my sleep. 
so when i came across an article that my friends over at @thethirty put together on a sleep trick, i was intriguing. and desperate. .
have you heard of the // trick? i hadn't until i read about it. the article explains it best, but essentially this is a breathing trick that forces your heart rate down. doing so allows your body to prepare for sleep. you take  seconds to inhale a deep, deep breath. then you hold that breath for  slow seconds. finally you release the breath slowly, using  full counts. the first time i tried this, on around  or  seconds of the exhale, i literally felt my muscles loosen. the fist i was unaware i was holding under my pillow actually released itself. i felt like i melted into my sheets. .
and hours later...i woke up.
i had fallen asleep within minutes. and i didn't wake up countless times during the night. i realize this sounds absurd. magical even. .
but simply forcing my body to prepare for rest was all i needed to do to cross the bridge into sleep. i'll be completely honest and say this works  times out of . there are still nights where i'm restless and lose plenty of sleep. but i wanted to share this trick with you all because it has helped me immensely! .
i also find a five minute deep stretch before bed to help me get into a state that's prepared for sleep. on days where i cant tackle my racing mind i rub lavender oil on my chest and wrists and have found success with that as well!
.
what are your bedtime tips and tricks for falling asleep? i'd love to hear them! .

Doc ID: 2383, distribution: 0.8911437831423723 ; The beach used to be one of my least favourite places... I felt like I couldn't eat beforehand or else I'd bloat, so I'd be sitting in a baggy t-shirt, under the sun, starving and comparing myself to all the girls beaming with confidence, feeling terrible!!! 

And now? Sunny days + the beach + @yoproau's new frozen dessert tubs + a great book + feeling comfortable with my bloated wobbly self in bikinis = the ideal date!! AD

I now have room in my mind & heart to no longer feel like I'm in competition with the people around me, but rather cheer them on & feel proud that they are comfortable in their skin too.

When you're struggling with something within yourself, it clouds your thoughts & perspective towards everything else in your life. I truly believe working on yourself will always be an amazing investment of your time!!

Being able to enjoy an ice cream at the beach on a hot summer's day was something I deprived myself of so many times, but I am so happy to no longer let my inner critic take control... It's okay to enjoy food without guilt, it's okay for your body to change across the day (and your lifetime) & it's okay to listen to your cravings.

For me, listening to my body means embracing that I have a massive sweet-tooth, but that my skin breaks out & my gut doesn't love when I consume TOO much sugar... So I like to live my best Hannah Montana life & live the best of both worlds by sometimes opting for a more balanced, nutritious choice! That's why I dropped into Coles to grab a tub of @yoproau's new Frozen Desserts = Salted Caramel Peanut & Double Choc ice creams, with g of protein per serve & no added sugar! 🍦

We never quite managed to meet up even though we talked about it. I'm not sure what went wrong but one day they just cut me off. Maybe on tumblr you see too much of someone's struggles and not enough of their real life to balance it out. I still don't get it. I don't think I have it in me to cut someone off so completely and ruthlessly. I think I'm glad about that.  There's only one other person I've encountered in my life who has similarly shaken my view of how people work and although I'm polite to that person when I see them now, I'll never bring myself to trust them again. I have a belief system about how friendships work and when someone acts in a way completely outside that, it's difficult to comprehend or make sense of.

to do absolutely nothing different.

i'm not a health professional, so i'm not qualified to dish out any sort of medical advice, but what i do know about bloating is that for the general population, it is very normal, it can be caused and exacerbated by a lot of different factors (including stressing about it), and it does not affect who you are or your worth.

i'm bloated, and i'm not going to dissect my body, restrict my food, or force myself to move my body. those are not options for me anymore. instead, i'm going to continue to accept my body, listen to my body, honor my body, and eat a slice (or however many i feel like) of this raw vegan snickers pie from my super talented friend @annaintheraw (which you can find at her cafe @annaintherawcafe in downtown cleveland) ✌🏽

These are some of the classic self-sabotage thoughts I had up until this year. At the beginning of  I started asking myself, “Will it matter when I'm older?” and it really helped me to stop overanalysing the small stuff and missing out on things that would bring me JOY.

Life will pass us by... So wear that bikini to the beach, upload that photo, go on that date, start your journey to health, spend a whole day watching movies, take a risk, skip leg day if you're not feeling up to it... Life is precious & can be challenging enough without the extra pressure we constantly put on ourselves.

today's been a rough day for me. a combination of burnout, not enough sleep, and facing new challenges that have brought up a lot of different emotions had me feeling like i was drowning a little bit. but, crying, emotionally eating, and allowing myself to rest are  forms of self-care that work for me and are always valid and okay for me to do.

self-care looks different on different days and for different people. don't let anyone make you feel guilty for doing what's best for you.

Doc ID: 9744, distribution: 0.6610724825286749 ; opposite action is something that when i committed to recovery and trying to rewire my brain, REALLY helped me combat my negative thoughts and stop labeling my actions.

essentially, opposite action means deliberately doing the opposite of your harmful emotional urge.

if i had the urge to run, i would choose to get closer.

if i had the urge to isolate myself, i would choose to reach out to someone.

if i had a thought telling me that i “shouldn't” eat the chocolate cupcake, even if i didn't know if i really wanted to eat it, i would choose to eat the cupcake anyway with the goal of taking away the power from the food and transferring the power back to myself by making the decision.

this helped me eventually change the thought process from thinking i “should” or “shouldn't” do something to thinking about if i do or don't WANT to do something.

initially, opposite action can feel really scary because it's literally going completely against what your thoughts want, but that's why it works. the more and more you do things that feel scary, the less scary they become, and the more you're able to actually tune into how you really feel and make the choice you really want.

well, the real answer is that no, you don't need to track anything in particular to be healthy. what you do need to do is pay attention to how you feel, and what your goals are. if your goal IS to build muscle, technically more protein is good but there's a good change you're getting what you need and you're not working out in the way that promotes muscle growth. if you don't add in protein rich foods to your meals and you feel hungry two hours after a big smoothie bowl with just fruit, you might need to add some protein. if that doesn't bother you and you'll just eat again, then honor you should that.

then there's the whole camp of people who say you shouldn't even think about protein when eating. I think there's pros and cons to this. if you're eating a diet that is colorful, has a high variety and foods from all food groups (grains/legumes included) and you feel energized, chances are you're getting what you need. 
personally i like to add supplements because I LOVE smoothie bowls but I got stuff to do so I like it to be satisfying for the next couple hours. I do love it for the taste also (salted caramel maca whaaaat). I also add other things that make a meal satisfying— nut butters, granola, seeds, nuts, etc. ive been using a lot of @vivolife lately and i'm really liking it! it's an all vegan brand / company, products are carbon neutral, and they're going in the zero waste direction! use my code AMANDA at checkout to save you $$$

🥂 Memories
👙 Positive body image
🤰🏻 My period, a regular cycle & balanced hormones
💪 Strength
⚡️ Energy
😍 Zest for life
💃🏻 Confidence 
🧠 Positive mindset
❤️‍🔥 Passion!! 
🍑 Curves
🤪 My personality… I feel like I'm more me, which makes me more fun to be around!
💖 Love… I have even more love to give now. Who would've thought that once you've learned how to treat yourself with love, you would have more to offer the world in return!! 
👯‍♀️ A desire to go out, eat out, make friends, say yes more & have fun!
⏰ TIME… I gained so much time back that I used to spend: thinking about food, tracking and weighing my ingredients, searching menus before going out, working out for longer than necessary, researching weight management, etc. I now have so much more room in my mind to think about things that really matter.

No matter how lean I was, I still wasn't good enough… I still wanted to lose more, or gain muscle, or change something… But now I understand it never had anything to do with the way I looked to start off with. What it really came down to was my mentality… Instead, I should've focused on how I spoke to myself, my mental & physical health, my happiness, and how much more I had to offer than my physical appearance. 

So I did. But I would've missed out on all of that if I continued to put the way I looked before the way I felt.

This isn't to villainise a leaner body type — I am still in a thin body, I won't deny that — this is about how I TREATED my body & all of the things I turned down in order to look a specific way. I hope this will encourage you to live a fuller life. Including your tummy! 🥰 This body I'm in now fluctuates throughout the year, it's the body that allows me to live my life focused on the things that really matter to me and make me happy. You deserve a life full of the same!! 💐

 really grateful to have figured out at least a handful of things i enjoy doing by the age of  besides bingeing and purging bc apparently for some theres no such thing as “too old for this shit” and im just glad im not one of those people.  i AM too old for this shit.  
 it makes me feel good to help others and talk others through their problems but some people just really arent ready for solutions / to get better and THT makes me depressed but oh well. not my life. guess i just still care when i rly shouldnt

“Too big, too skinny, too short, too tall, too outspoken, too quiet, trying too hard” — there's this feeling that we're all 'too' something while at the same time not good enough.

And it's crippling. But guess what? Telling your brain all of these things is only adding fuel to the fire. If you're filling your mind with these thoughts, it's no wonder it's all you see when you take a glance at your own reflection. As I've mentioned before, your brain looks for all the things you've told it in order to confirm & validate how you're feeling. So when you start speaking positively to yourself, slowly in time, that's what you'll start to seek & find.

So I'm just leaving this series of posed VS unposed photos here each Monday to remind you not to compare YOUR real to someone else's Instagram highlight reel. A lot of what you see online is the photos on the left, but what I see is the version on the right because that's what my body looks like % of the time when I relax & just let my body be free. I used to struggle to even look at the unposed, unedited, natural, normal version of me… But now I appreciate & embrace all versions of me. THAT'S the version of yourself that you deserve to feel comfortable in too.

You can either view yourself through a negative lens or consciously start choosing to view yourself through a positive one — easier said than done, of course — but which lens are you going to start choosing? Let me know in the comments for accountability!!! Leave a “➖” for negative & a “➕” for positive! Put it out there 🙌🏼

Happy Real Me Monday angels 👼🤍🌱 have the best possible week & don't forget to be kind to your mind! Chat to you in the comments ✨

i question my place on this platform a lot, and it bothers me a lot that i even do that because of how much i believe in knowing your worth in anything you do. while i accept myself unconditionally and feel good knowing i've never tried to be someone i'm not on here, sometimes, i can't help questioning my content and what i'm even doing.

i'm taking a note out of my own book and practicing some self-care by starting a little social media detox tomorrow to help me find more peace with this and everything else swirling around my head! i might be away for  days,  days, a week...there's no set amount of time- just until i feel like posting would be something actually coming from me and not just my desire to want to post.

i'm not gonna lie, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. i've found myself trying to run away and isolate myself some days and emotionally stuff myself with external things on others. but, in between the times that feel like chaos, i am learning to listen to what my needs really are, exploring new ways to find comfort and joy, and enjoying just being me, and even though it hasn't been that long since i've been spending this amount of time alone, i'm really freaking proud of myself.

something that's taken me a loooong time to truly believe and understand is that you are your biggest commitment, and your relationship with yourself is the most important one you will ever have because at the end of the day, no matter what happens, the person who is ALWAYS there with you is yourself.

you've made it to here. so, remember to celebrate yourself because even on days when you can't see it, you have survived so much and come so far.

happy saturday! got my hair cut for the first time in (over?) a year this morning and am off to finish my packing my bags! 🤍✨

Doc ID: 14914, distribution: 0.3155161804502401 ; Question: Hi Faith :)) What was the environment around food like for you growing up? Answer: Ugh it was awful. Almost every negative thing you can think of related to food went on in my house. My mum dieted, she tried to get my dad on a diet - endless different diets. There was shaming around weight. Fat shaming. Good food and bad food. Lots of talk over numbers of calories and fat in food. Guilt over being hungry and being told “oh you can't possibly be hungry”. Commenting on what people were eating. Mealtimes were stressful, a place where we were always told off for table manners, high anxiety, often ending in shouting (my dad) and crying (my sister and I). My dad did a lot of secret eating and my mum had tight control of the kitchen and knew what food had gone. She hid food to stop it being eaten. We had to ask permission before we could get anything to eat. Sometimes if my mum was away for the day, I was left in charge of making sure my dad didn't eat any bad things. My dad was delighted at being left on his own and would take us out for lunch and eat very indulgently, leaving me caught in between my parents actions. If we went out for a family meal, my dad would eat too much and my mum would look in great pain having to watch him, she would be wincing and pulling faces and commenting.Looking back on it all in therapy, it is of absolutely no surprise that controlling my eating became the coping mechanism I ended up using to manage my feelings. Eating was connected with such high anxiety and so polarised already that it was only a small step to falling into unhealthy behaviours. The one positive is that it has made me absolutely % clear on what NOT to do with my own children.

So that they can protect you a bit?” “No… I don't think so. I wouldn't want them to be in the firing line.” “Because you don't think they could handle it?” “I just… I couldn't stand it. I would rather take it myself” “Yes, because you have always been the protector. And what does that say about the nature of what went on? When you can't bear anyone else to experience it…?” T looked at me meaningfully and I shuffled and fidgeted a bit.  I said that I thought lots of Christmas will be really nice, and I feel a bit guilty about enjoying the nice bits. Like how can I be there enjoying things, all the time alongside all the difficult stuff we have been talking about? T reminded me, “Remember we had all the good things about your relationship with your mum boxed up and kept safe?”  “Oh yes…. I forgot about that…. I just…. I feel like I need you to be there with me.” I know we are coming to the end of the session and I'm about to be on my own for three weeks. “Would it help if you knew you could message me if you needed to?” I nodded. T said “So, you can do that. You can message me if you need to. I can't promise I'll reply straight away but when I get chance I will.”  It really was just about the end of the session then. T turned the conversation to lighter things and I suddenly came up with a rush of things to tell her. I told her about a situation with d where I'd used something I learnt in therapy, and T said how well I was doing. Then we said our goodbyes and I wished T a Happy Christmas.

know that thinner does not mean healthier,

be actively learning about Health At Every Size,

understand that you deserve to live a life that is not focused around shrinking your body,

throw out your scale,

know that your worth does not lie in how you look,

and STILL want to lose weight.

the pressure to be thin in our society is very present and very real, and if you are struggling with tuning out the noise of diet culture, i see you. choosing to simply accept yourself and your body in a culture that tells you that you can always be doing and being “better” is hard!

tbh, i don't have the answers for how to just get over this challenge, but what i can remind you of is that facing your food fears, fighting against this oppressive society, and rebelliously choosing to embrace yourself exactly how you are made to be ARE SO ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.

disclaimer: it's okay if you are someone trying to lose weight, and i'm not judging you for it. this post is geared towards people who want to prioritize their health over their appearance and who want to change that their unhealthy relationship with their body.

 ugh. im s jsusuena FAAGHHH 
 im wanna puNCH SOMETHING :') :'(  
 and now im crying 
 ive been cycling thru all the negative emotions all day it feels like 
 rock bottom fucking sucks im trying so hard to just be happy and positive and motivatrf and responsible and like im just really failing at all of them. between being a worthy student and taking gen ed classes at a community college seriously because i wont do well if i dont, and recovering a  plant garden from heat stroke and learning curves, and finding the time and means to make money, finding the time and means to feed myself proper food which im also failing at miserably, and making sure my ferrets are % tended to and vetted and in cleaned environments and etc, and worrying about my damn dog, and my other damn dog, and the other damn dog, and the other damn do- sorry i mean my ¿boyfriend?, and dealing with my mentally unstable/unaware father (winning combination), and not having a printer which is integral to my school n my money, and not having a vehicle, not having any money for a new one, still having bills and debts im barely keeping up with, and showing up on time and ready to focus to therapy … like. between all of that. all i can feel is stress and negative emotions and idk what to do. therapy isnt really helping me feel better its just helping me think clearer but im clearly still generally.. miserable-ish so. idk.  
 im not expecting anyone to read this i guess typing it out also just helps me think clearer. instead of focusing on my emotions tormenting and overwhelming me, and my fucking cramps.. i can just brain vomit into a text post instead. im hungry and i havent eaten much the last few days but im also acutely disgusted with myself and i want to eat but i dont and im trying not to think about it because the fact that i cant and dont want to take care of myself makes me feel pathetic and that just makes me want to not take care of myself more and its just a vicious inceptionistic cycle and its disorienting and i feel like im in highschool again like im a teenager with no control over my life and thats the worst feeling ever because i barely made it through that part of my life lol

Doc ID: 2561, distribution: 0.5691577775688781 ; The words “I am” are powerful, because whatever you follow it up with has the power to make or break you.

Your body hears it. Your mind hears it. You feel it.

As an experiment, I stood in front of the mirror after a shower, looked at myself & said “I'm ugly” — I instantly felt sad & it became so much easier to start picking out the things I didn't love. The negative thoughts were almost instantaneous.

But then I closed my eyes, refreshed my mind, opened my eyes again & said “I'm beautiful” — that instantly felt better. I instantly felt kinder towards myself. I noticed I started to smile at my reflection.

I know it won't be as easy as that for everyone, so please don't feel like a failure if you can't bring yourself to be kind BUT please try to remember that when you speak about yourself throughout the day (every day), your mind & body takes that in. It starts to become part of your identity. And not only does your body take those comments in, your friends, your family, your colleagues, your audience online does too.

My future children will never hear me say:
I'm ugly
I “can't” wear that
Gross, look at my…
I'll have to work that off in the gym
I can't, I'm trying to be “good”
When I lose weight…
I look gross

Things my children WILL hear me say:
Yum, that was delicious. I enjoyed every bite!
I'm so proud of myself
I am worthy of that
I feel beautiful in this
I'm a good person 
I feel great today!!

Moral of the story & challenge of the week: let's try to be mindful of the thoughts we tell ourselves & the comments we make about ourselves. It's okay to have a bad body image day, I'd never tell you to internalise your feelings, but try to acknowledge when those thoughts are happening & get into the habit of rephrasing them or doing your best to be kinder to yourself. If you're gonna try it this week, leave a “🙏🏼” in the comments for accountability! You've got this 💗

Happy Real Me Monday!! Your body is worthy of embrace ALWAYS. Don't forget that when you're scrolling through social media today! xox

.
.
phew, let me sit down for a second.
.
.
i'll begin with this bold, blunt, and blatantly truthful statement: i'm not obligated to prove anything to anyone. i dont express this from a place of defense or anger, but rather one of sadness, feeling misunderstood. everything i'm about to say is not fueled by hate but rather a cathartic release of emotions that this message raised.
.
.
i live a full life beyond the confines of a photo grid on a social media platform. i shouldn't be expected to capture every single second and showcase them all. it's unrealistic. obsessive. for lack of a better word, “unhealthy”.
.
.
to address how my feed is too “healthy”: my account is a creative outlet for me to explore a deep passion of mine, health and wellness. i thoroughly enjoy cooking with nutrient dense, wholesome ingredients. this is my lifestyle. i've earned the right to practice it in every way.
.
.
when i eat what this user is referring to as “unhealthy” foods, i'm likely surrounded by friends and family at the time. i'm living in the moment, being present and making memories, not capturing photos and using their company to curate content. when i'm drunk eating pizza with my friends at  AM or stuffing my face with my mom's famous cookies, i'm not capturing a perfectly curated shot to place on my feed. i'm…busy…living.
.
.
just because you don't SEE these things doesn't mean they don't happen. could i make more of an effort to showcase them? sure, but the purpose of this account is to serve my wellbeing. always be wary of comparing your life to ones you see online. nobody is telling the full picture, and you can't expect them to do so in order to placate you. i do my best to communicate balance through this platform. i hope that is enough.
.
.
if it is not, so it goes. i wish you the best! rest assured, i'm *certainly* living my best life ♥️

At the high point we had an amazing ° view and it was glorious.  It was just what I needed as I'm still stressed by the neighbour and the water under the house saga take . It was really good to get out in the fresh air and take my mind off it all. I felt much better when we got home. I was disappointed in myself that it floored me so badly, just as I was thinking that I was getting better at dealing with stressed. The stress makes me shut down and close in on myself. H and all the girls were trying to give me a hug last night and make me feel better, and later I could have talked to H but I just want to be left alone. It's like I can't bear to risk the stress leaking out so I have to hold it all in as tight as I can and shove it down so I can pretend I'm dealing with it. Anyway, today after our walk I feel less panicked about it. I've spoken to our builder who's coming round this week and H has looked out the report from when we had the drains looked at, so we have a couple of options. Let's hope one of them works out.

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup 🥰

We're not married but it's definitely on the cards in the not so far future. The thing is that he earns double what I do (k) but we pay exactly half of every outgoing each. He knows how much (how little) I earn and I just feel like although it's equal, it's unfair proportionally and I'm not sure how to broach the topic and I don't know if I should's so many different approaches, and different things work for different couples. H and I just have one joint account, all our money goes into it and all our outgoings come out of it and all the money belongs to both of us. That works great for us. But I know other couples do different things that work great for them. There's not one right answer.So yes, you should definitely definitely talk about it with your boyfriend. At some point you must have had a conversation that resulted in your current set up. But how is it going to work if one of you loses your job, or has to stop work because of illness, or you have a baby and one of you takes parental leave and isn't earning? It is totally within your right to ask your partner to have a conversation about it. What's more it's healthy and a sign of a strong relationship if you can talk about these important things and think about how you would cope with various potential events in the future. You don't have to come up with the solution in the first conversation, and it's probably best if you don't approach it with a “the current set up isn't fair” (even if you don't think it is!) But just open the conversation and start thinking about your options and make space for both of you to share how you feel about things. How have you both formed your views on money? How did each of your parents handle money? Did you have plenty of money in your childhood or was money tight? Do you have any big savings goals? How much debt do you both have, and how is it being paid off? How do you feel about credit cards? loans? a mortgage? Are you spenders or savers? Do you give to charity?Now go, talk about it!!

Relapses dont last forever either.Reach out to those around you, if we are all literally stuck in the same room might as well make nice and support each other through this bullshit. Its not easy fighting for recovery especially when the trail gets turned upside down. Thats okay. Forgive the slip ups, and try again. Ask for help. No shame here.

Doc ID: 16085, distribution: 0.6480315759334571 ; Question: I've been having a really hard time lately fighting with the majority of my friends. We are constantly arguing about how much they are struggling "adulting" and managing their money. Most of them just started living on their own, when I have been for yrs, and all make more money and have lower bills but all constantly have to get help or have like $ to their name. It's getting to the point I don't want to talk to them anymore because it's so frustrating. Help tumblr mom!  Answer: Ah that's tough anon, you are in a different life space to your friends. Living independently is a big shock and there's lots to get used to, and you do feel like you've got too much to do and no money, plus having to do all those boring routine adulting things. Living on your own for six years, you are several steps ahead of them in independence and experience. Stuff your friends are struggling with will probably have become things you can do without thinking now, and then it can be difficult to remember how much energy just basic living took up when you started out.Only you can decide whether your friendships can get through this. Can you spend time together without talking about money or adulting? You don't need to fix all their situations. Or maybe you need to try and meet new friends that fit more with the phase of life you're in. Friendships often do move around as we move through different stages of life, we drift apart from some friends and become closer to others. Some friendships survive the varying stages of life, by focusing on what they have in common or being willing to listen to each other's struggles even if we can't really appreciate the situation the other one is in.You probably can't change your friends or their struggles, so the ball is in your court. If it really feels too frustrating to keep seeing them, then you can gently pull away - maybe even only temporarily. If you do keep seeing them, then I think you just have to find a way to accept that these are their struggles right now and they're valid, just as your struggles in the place you're in are also valid.

I nearly said it at the end of a previous session a few weeks ago, and vaguely did, and T didn't understand and then because we were so nearly out of time then, I decided not to pursue it. So this session, when it came up I took the plunge. “I know it's good, that I'm doing so much better now. It's good that I can be my own adult voice and keep myself on track with eating, and even when I am late with a meal or don't want to eat something, I can tell myself that this is what I need to do. But sometimes I don't want to be the one to do that! I miss back when I was unwell, and I would text you in a panic over something I couldn't get out of eating, and you would tell me it would be ok and I could eat it, or I needed to eat it, or whatever. I miss that…. although I do know that it was also awful. I mean, the food aspect made me completely stressed out, and then texting you and reaching out for that connection, made me completely stressed out too, so I know it wasn't a lovely place to be. But I just miss someone else making food feel ok for me. There's part of me that doesn't want to be the grown up with it and have to do it for myself.” By the way, I definitely didn't say it in one long clear paragraph like that. It came out in fits and starts with T prompting and asking for clarification along the way. We've been working together for so long that she knows how to help me keep talking, what prompts to use. I know that she knows, so when I trail off and she gets me going again, I know exactly what she is doing but I submit myself to the process and go with it. It's like a back and forth between the part of me that wants to share and the part of me that wants to protect myself from being vulnerable. T helps the sharing part to keep coming forward. When I'd got it all out and T had understood it, she said I was very brave to say that and she knows it takes courage to admit something like that. I felt relieved that I'd managed to say it all. I know I can't go back to that child-like state where I depend on T to monitor my eating and look after me food-wise and I only ate because T made me agree to do so. I know it was hellish at the time so I don't even want to, but it's the *feeling* of T being so nurturing and caretaking and me feeling so child-like and reparented that I miss.

Doc ID: 13094, distribution: 0.2092687943383984 ; Empty: A Memoir by Susan Burton
 
 So I just finished this incredible book, and I have a lot of thoughts to dump out about it.   It's different from other binge eating books that I've read in that it does not focus on recovery—Burton is upfront about that, and it's basically in the title (it's a memoir, not a guide or explanation). And, a good chunk of it is about her restrictive eating phases before and after her bingeing phase. But it really, really resonated. It's kind of incredible how experiences that you think are unique to you, are in fact common experiences.  Even if this book didn't provide a clear path forward for myself, it made me feel less alone. To quote Burton, who also dove into books about eating disorders while in the midst of her own: “I wasn't interested in the end, the part where she came out okay. I wanted to stay in the part where she was wrecked. I wanted to feel less alone, because isolation had become the primary consequence of what I did, separating myself from the regular people who lived in the regular way” (Burton ). Burton voiced thoughts that I didn't know I had until I read them, and she articulated feelings I've struggled with. Here are some quotes that I felt in my soul, in case they help anyone else: Describing bingeing as “a way to temporarily shut everything out and exist in an altered reality defined by the loosening of restraint. But bingeing deadened feeling and was incompatible with human connection” (Burton ). Later describing binge eating as “a 'short-term escape from an aversive awareness of self'” (Burton ).  I had never conceived of bingeing in that way in particular, but when I read it, it felt right. In the moments of bingeing, it's almost freeing—I'm in a different world where it doesn't matter what I eat, I'm just free to eat and exist and nothing else matters aside from that freedom. But it's not a “freedom” to actively avoid reality and everything it brings. It's caging, it's isolating, and it prevents living my life. I'm actively avoiding existing as myself—my mind, my body, my life feels too uncomfortable (even if that discomfort might just be the uncomfortable “urges to binge” that Kathryn Hanson describes in Brain Over Binge) and I turn to bingeing.  Describing her mother calling out her anger: “My anger had been talked about before. And, yes, I had plenty of it, but it was all at myself. I was angry at myself for all the wrong ways I was. I wouldn't be angry if I were better! If I could just fix myself, this would all end” (Burton ).  God, the anger and self-loathing is so real. On days I binge, or even think about the consequences of previous binges, I just feel like absolute shit, and I'm teetering on the edge of lashing out at everyone around me. But part of me wants to scream that I'm not angry at them, I'm angry at me. And I've convinced myself I just need to “fix myself” and stop bingeing, and then I'll be the perfect bubbly person I want to me. Is this true? Probably not.  “Ten minutes was enough to ruin everything. How was it that in such a small unit of time you could make an entire day into a total wreck?” (Burton ).  Simply put, this quote was just relatable. It feels impossible some days to ever be a “normal eater” when an entire day can be ruined with ten minutes of bingeing. I know that black-and-white thinking is a problem that needs to be addressed, and days can't truly be “ruined,” but it was refreshing to see this account written by someone else—a professional! a writer! a perfectionist, over-achiever like me!—who felt the same way I do.  “Other girls just had their bodies and put food into them and didn't think. Or they did think but in a normal way. I could tell by the way they said it: 'I am getting so fat.' They weren't wrecked by food in the way I was; it didn't define them” (Burton ).
  I felt this one so strongly. Even when I was mostly “recovered” in college, I still envied the girls who could talk about their food or bodies without feeling deeply uncomfortable or shameful in the way that eating disorders mess up your cognitive associations. And I know that's unfair of me; I never know what other people are going through, including with food, and Burton addresses her own experiences with having to challenge her preconceived notions of others and her own self-centered perception of eating disorders. It adds to the guilty and shame, I think—to hate yourself, and to project that anger onto others who seem more “normal,” and then to hate yourself even more for doing so.  “My eating had worsened in distinct stages. Beginning each new level, I'd felt horror that this is the worst it's ever been. Now the worst felt medical. There were times I ate so much food I worried something bad could happen to my body. A line had been crossed: The fear of the harm I was doing was now worse than the humiliation of continuing to expand” (Burton ).
  So much about this book had me yelling internally, “This is me! This is me!”. I can point to specific times when it felt like I'd crossed a bingeing threshold. For example, I would previously never eat at night—not because I was actively avoiding eating at night, but just because it had never really occurred to me to do so, and I didn't have the desire to. Until I did once during a binge, and suddenly it became a new norm. The number of time's I've said to myself, “This is the worst it's been…” Yikes. And Burton specifically discussing the medical fears—I have felt genuinely afraid of the damage I was doing, of the heart palpitations and the stomach discomfort and the severe bloating. I'd imagine how embarrassing it would be to die from bingeing so hard that my stomach bursts, and I get so anxious about the possibility. B.E.D is truly horrible.  Discussing how the life milestone of leaving for college couldn't even feel like an important milestone because of the bingeing: “I could not even contemplate what I felt about leaving home. The only exit I cared about was from the eating. Until I left that, nothing else would matter” (Burton ).  Bingeing takes over your life. I feel like I cannot live fully, I cannot do anything, until I get my eating under control. It just fills my mind constantly: thoughts of food, eating, weight, body, meals. Nothing else seems to matter, and nothing else can matter, until I clear some of the mental space that is currently taken up by bingeing.  Reflecting on her post-binge rituals of writing and setting new never-again goals each time: “It was the first moment I realized that I was getting something from this. That I liked something about this. I liked the possibility inherent in the act. I liked getting as low as you could and then every day the moment of begin-again. I liked the calm that followed an episode. Something quieted, the need met. Ah, yes, here I am in the place where I make resolutions and start afresh” (Burton ). “And it was true that I would miss the cycle of destruction and renewal, so regular that it was circadian” (Burton ).  This really caused me to reflect on my own “destruction and renewal” cycles. It's true—after a binge, there's something ridiculously empowering about setting new goals and resolutions and feeling convinced that it will never happen again because in that moment, it truly feels like a fresh start and a new beginning. Is that part of what keeps the habit engrained? That part of me thrives on the fleeting sense of control, even though I am never able to follow through with those resolutions? Some of my most productive moments have been post-binge, once I get past the self-loathing stage and move on to the resolution, future-oriented stage. I had just never before considered this to be an inherent part of the bingeing cycle…  Describing her constant food thoughts as a sound engineering metaphor: “The eating stuff was a track that ran in my brain under all the other tracks. Sometimes it would get so loud that it would drown out all the other tracks; sometimes I could lower the volume, but I was never able to remove the track from the session. Deleting the track was the wrong idea, [my therapist] said; lowering the volume was good, but the main thing was to boost the other tracks. Boost the other tracks. Develop other strengths and ways to cope; raise the signal on all I'd neglected” (Burton ).  I absolutely loved this metaphor. Food takes up so much of my brain energy and thoughts, and I have been so desperate to clear up that space for other things. But if I find ways to focus on other strengths and cope with life in new ways, the space will clear itself to make room for the new focuses. It's kind of intuitive, so it's not particularly new information, but I wanted to print out this quote and wallpaper my room in it. It gives me hope.

Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.” On July , , I celebrated two years sober. Even though I'm a survivor, even though I have not touched a mind or mood altering substance since , even though I have a life beyond my wildest dreams- I was still ashamed for so long to publicly share a fact that made me “less then perfect.” Today I am a little less ashamed because sobriety is what has given me the best moments of my life. Before I got sober I was miserable. A miserable shell of a human who allowed others to treat me like sh*t because that is what I thought-And was broken down to believe- I deserved.

Sobriety has made me emotionally, spiritually and physically (because I actually take care of my body now) stronger, it has open doors that would have remained closed forever, it has literally handed me my dream job, it really has made me believe that there is nothing in this world that I can't get/be if I put the work in, and it truly has saved my life.

In the rooms I have heard the saying- alcoholics are the only people given two lives in one lifetime if they choose sobriety, and I am so damn happy that I have been able to live and love this second life. I do hope this post helps anyone who is struggling who feels all alone in the shame of this disease to know that they so are not alone, that recovery is possible even for the worst alcoholics and I % believe I am that much more amazing in every way because I fight this disease every day.”

👑self-care queen👑

while i appreciated it wholeheartedly, i also felt conflicted. in my head, that statement  implied “self care” is something extravagant and not something for everyone

but self care is an imperative….
it's a non-negotiable to me

when i'm not taking care of myself / prioritizing myself, the care/attention/love i can give to the people around me is less genuine. i'm more resentful and snappy and unhappy with the way my attention is constantly directed away from my own needs

you can't pour from an empty cup, but it also doesn't feel good to be constantly pouring from a half-full cup. fill that cup all the way! fill it up so much that it's constantly overflowing and overflowing everyone else's cups! fill it up so much that there's not a chance the people around you won't feel it and be inspired to continue filling theirs.

self-care isn't just the thing i do on the weekends when i “have time.” it's the thing i do regularly so that i don't feel neglected by myself. it's the thing that allows me to be present and hold space for other people. 

so if that looks like saying “no” to people, say no
if that looks like being on IG less, be on IG less
if that looks like going out for a walk during your lunch, do that
if that looks like having difficult conversations to set your boundaries with others…. do it. that's what i've been doing lately. 

and what's interesting is that when i got that message i was just coming out of a week of stress and sleep deprivation. i was trying to get back on my self-care extra hard because i saw how my attitude was affecting other people. 

we are all entitled to be self care queens/kings❤️ it's not selfish. it's not self-centered. it's not disregard for others. it's simply showing up for you so you an show up for others. 

how do you show up for yourself on a regular basis?  let me know 👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼

Doc ID: 2496, distribution: 0.5248131238800688 ; Happy Real Me Monday! A few years ago, every Monday marked the beginning of a new endeavour to have my “dream body”… But I just wanted to remind you:

🌟 Just because it's Monday doesn't mean you need to start a new fad diet or punish yourself for what you ate or did over the weekend.

🌟 It's not a dream body if it's a nightmare to maintain!! 

🌟 AND the “dream bodies” you see online & compare yourself to probably don't always look like that anyway (take these photos as an example!!)

My dream body now is whichever body I'm in when I'm living my happiest, most balanced life!! 

Giving up diet culture & accepting your body does not mean you're “letting” yourself or your health go. I believe it's actually one of the healthiest things you can do! All bodies — at any size — can engage in health-promoting behaviours that can improve health: reducing stress, joyful movement, intuitive eating, balanced nutrition, therapy/communication, sleeping more, prioritising your inner peace & so on.

Here's a quote I read recently that made me feel all warm & fuzzy towards my own body and reminded me WHY I choose to make healthy choices out of love for my body instead of hate.

You are not too “fat” or too “skinny”.
You are not too “old” or too “wrinkly”.
Your nose isn't too big & your 🍑 isn't too small.
This body has carried you around your whole life.
It's picked you up when you've fallen down.
Fought through colds and flus, broken bones and broken hearts.
Even when you put it down, it just keeps going.
Keeps on working to the best it can.
Through the good & bad, your heart continues to beat.
It'll take you through to the very end.
What a beautiful, clever thing.
And what a beautiful, brilliant person you are.

next time you catch yourself shaming yourself or feeling guilty for what you ate, how you look, or how your body is, ask yourself, where did my beliefs about this come from? and learn to reframe your thoughts.

some examples:

“i can't trust my body because whenever i eat X, i gain weight.” —> “i've broken trust with my body by trying to control it, and weight gain is not inherently bad. my body is on my side, and if it changes size by nourishing it with what it's asking for, then it was supposed to change size.”

“i have to calorie count because i'm afraid of what eating more than X calories will do to me.” —> “calorie counting keeps me from using internal cues of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction. calories are not the enemy. they don't do something to me, they are energy that do something for me.”

“other people eat and workout a certain way, so i'm supposed to eat and workout that way too.” —> “there is no 'right', 'perfect', or superior way to eat or move. that might be for them, but it is not for me.”

“moving my body every day is healthy.” —> “taking care of my body every day is healthy. sometimes that means movement, and sometimes that means rest.”

“being smaller than other people makes
 me better and helps me in life.” —> “accepting my natural body size whatever that may be and honoring what my body needs allows me to focus on living out my purpose which is what will help me live a more fulfilling and joyful life.”

to be completely honest i was one of those kids who LOVED the pink frosted sugar cookies from the grocery store… the ones that literally looked fake hahaha. they're just so nostalgic 🥹

inspired in part by those and also by the cozy holiday season rapidly approaching, i decided to make an everyday, no-bake sugar cookie treat to keep on hand this week. i always have a no-bake snack in my fridge/freezer for my daily sweet tooth and these are such a good mix in the rotation. this recipe is the perfect balance of flavor/pleasure of the real thing and more nutritious, wholesome ingredients. definitely not a replacement for real sugar cookies. if you want the cookie just eat it < 

no-bake vanilla frosted sugar cookie bars

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
-  tbsp maple syrup
-  tbsp granulated sugar
- / cup oat flour

directions:

add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the vanilla frosted layer.

vanilla frosted layer:

- / cup vanilla non-dairy yogurt of choice
-  tbsp room temp vegan cream cheese
-  tbsp granulated sugar   
add all of the ingredients to a bowl and hand whisk until a thick, uniform frosting forms. this took about  minutes for me. 

spread this layer over the top of the base later and top with sprinkles if desired. place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️

vegan soft and chewy iced oatmeal cookies

set oven to . in a small bowl make a flax egg ( tbsp ground flax + tbsp water) mix and let set.

while that's setting, beat together using an electric hand mixer:

- / cup vegan butter (room temp)
- / cup coconut sugar

once that's well combined, add:

-  tbsp date molasses
- the flax egg
- splash of vanilla 
beat until well mixed. then add:

- / cup +  tbsp oat flour
- sea salt
- pinch of baking powder
- pinch of cinnamon

beat again. then add:

- / cup gf rolled oats

once the batter is uniform and sticky, drop spoonfuls onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. these spread A LOT (we're going for a thin, sticky, gooey cookie) so make sure there's room for that. i used two sheets. bake for - min. take out when you think they look too underdone (this is KEY). if you over cook they'll burn! i took mine out and let cool COMPLETELY. they'll set really nicely.

once they're cooled, ice them! i just combined  cup of powdered sugar with  tbsp almond milk, mixed to combine, poured over, and put in the fridge to set.

problem solved 😌 no bake, high protein, and vegan too! these were an absolute dream. i hope you love them! 

mini pumpkin pie bites

- / cup creamy salted peanut butter
-  tbsp maple syrup
-  scoops (or / cup) vanilla plant based protein powder
- / cup pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
-  tbsp oat flour
- pinch each of sea salt, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon

mix all of the ingredients together until a uniform dough forms that holds together well. if the batter is too loose, add another tbsp of oat flour (this might be because the protein powder you used absorbed more liquid). once you have the right consistency, roll dough into balls and add to a plate. i rolled mine in chopped white chocolate but that's optional :) place in the freezer for an hour or two to set before enjoying. store in the fridge for up to a week or in the freezer for a month!

directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth. remove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer.

Doc ID: 6741, distribution: 1.0 ; i can explain 👀

that first ingredient in the blender? butter beans… yeah... 🥲

but listen!!! tone  fair, you guys absolutely loved my chickpea cookie dough muffins and bars— i'm confident you can add these brownies to the list of 'bean-based desserts i didn't expect to love, but now can't live without' (working title, it's a bit long hahaha). you get the point.

not only do the butter beans give these brownies a rich, fudgey texture, they also pack plenty of protein and literally no flavor. you CANNOT even taste them!

i topped mine with a simple vegan chocolate ganache to really take these to the next level. you can add a scoop of protein powder into the icing too if you're really looking for an extra high protein treat!

details below, really hope this one makes it into your baking rotation soon :)

high protein vegan fudge brownies

in a food processor combine the following:

-  can butter beans (rinse and drained) you can probably substitute any other beans here, but i like the size of these for this recipe!
-  large banana

puree until smooth, then add the remaining ingredients:

- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder
- / cup chocolate protein powder
- / cup oat flour
- sea salt
- pinch of baking powder
- / cup non-dairy milk

blend everything until a uniform batter forms. transfer the batter to a greased baking tin. bake at F for - minutes and let cool completely before icing. i like to place mine in the fridge to cool since i find they get extra rich and fudgy this way!

while the brownies are cooling, make the chocolate ganache. in a small bowl combine:

- / cup cacao powder
- / cup powdered sugar 
-  tbsp non-dairy milk

whisk until smooth and uniform, then spread over the brownies. place back in the fridge to set before slicing!

i used to be so afraid to eat high fat foods, which in hindsight is absolutely wild to me. a nutrient dense recipe like this one is now my body's best friend— tasty, nourishing, and satiating. 

a bit of a rant but i hope it reaches someone who needs to hear it today. food should not be feared but rather embraced 🙏

i digress 🤪 this recipe is loaded with many anti-inflammatory ingredients that will help balance hormone levels and keep you happy and healthy— especially during *that* time of the month yayyyy. i've been crumbling these into yogurt bowls or enjoying with a smoothie on the side. just some ideas that hopefully inspire you to make a batch!

snack for healthy hormones 

sweet & salty chocolate bars 

to a food processor add and blend the following:

- - medium soft pitted dates
- / cup raw almonds
- / cup raw walnuts
-  tbsp ground flaxseed
- / cup cacao powder
- / cup chocolate protein powder (this is optional)
-  tbsp maca powder
-  tbsp maple syrup
- **don't add right away, but you'll need water to blend (i add up to / cup in  tbsp increments as the blender is going)

blend everything and slowly add the water as the food processor is running. this will allow a formable, sticky dough to form. once this consistency is achieved, transfer the mixture to a parchment paper lined tupperware or loaf pan and place in the fridge to set for a few minutes. i topped mine with melted dark chocolate (/ cup chocolate chips with  tbsp tahini, melted in the microwave until smooth). i like melting my chocolate with tahini over coconut oil because the result is richer/thicker and it doesn't crack when sliced into!

pour the chocolate over top and place back in the fridge to set. once hardened, slice into bars and enjoy!

vegan apple pie sugar cookies 

set oven to  and grease a cookie sheet. 

cut an apple in half, dice one half into very tiny pieces, and place to the side. you can even toss in a food processor and give a few quick pulses if that's easier! save the other half for snacking later 🤤

 in a bowl add the following:

- / cup coconut sugar
- / cup softened vegan butter 
-  flax egg ( tbsp ground flax +  tbsp water, mix and let sit until gelled)
- splash of vanilla

using a hand mixer, beat these until well combined. then add:

-  / cups gluten free flour
- pinch of baking powder, sea salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, 

stir the dry into the wet until a sticky dough forms. if it's too loose, add another tbsp or two of flour until it thickens up. stir through the apple chunks here! then chill dough in the fridge for a few minutes to set. remove from fridge and use a cookie scoop to drop dough onto the sheet. bake for about - minutes (you'll want these as soft as possible while still being cooked inside). let cool until just slightly warm to the touch before icing. 

for the icing here i just beat  tbsp of the vegan butter with  tbsp of coconut sugar, then spread it on the barely warm cookies. the result was that it melted into a bit of a glaze, which i loved!

Doc ID: 12959, distribution: 0.33051559117499607 ; sometimes i wonder if this “food thing” is ever going to be easy or simple again. i call it intuitive eating, but is it, really? am i not having more or less the same breakfast over and over again, with slight alterations? it includes all the nutrients i need, it's a good breakfast and i usually don't even want anything else, i like it the way it is. so far, so good. but panicking weeks or even months beforehand when i know i am going to stay at someone else's place, simply because i don't know what i'm gonna have for breakfast there, what about that? recovery is supposed to be freeing, i really have to push myself a little more and get out of my comfort zone. breakfast is the easiest meal currently, at the same time it's the only one i'm so strict about. another important thing i noticed: yesterday in the evening i had frozen berries and mango with a bit of oatmilk (as a snack), it makes for a nice “ice cream”, i wanted to challenge myself though and added a bit of sugar. started a bad process, but there's something else i noticed, it didn't occur for the first time. apparently i am not used to taking in a lot of sugar anymore, i of course include carbs in most of my meals, but simple carbs as in sugar are a bit of a fear food, so i usually avoid that. the thing is, when i do eat something sugary every once in a while, it instantly gives me a bad headache and i feel very sick. and simple carbs like that are considered “'unhealthy”“ anyway, what do i do? do i keep going against my ed, body signals and what is scientifically proven to be healthier, just to get over this fear food? or do i, hm, not? at this point i really don't know what to do, i don't even enjoy very sweet things (only chocolate). does anyone have any advice? 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 2425, distribution: 1.0 ; I grew up my entire life thinking I'm allowed certain foods but I can't have other foods, and if I did eat “bad foods”, I'd feel incredibly guilty about it and punish myself for it. 

I'd heard so many comments like this:
“that has too many carbs”
“are you going to eat all of that?”
“I can't eat that, it's too fatty”
“I can't have another banana, I've already had one today”
“that's so bad for you”
etc

And thinking about food in such a black-and-white restrictive way ended up controlling my life for a long while. I turned down invites to eat out with friends, I quite literally put a scale on the table at Christmas to weigh my potatoes to make sure I didn't have “too many” and I was miserable watching others have cake when I told myself I couldn't have any. Until that craving became so prominent and all-consuming that I'd give into temptation, go overboard and binge… Then the cycle would begin all over again. 

That is not a sustainable way of living your life, nor is it necessary at all.

Now, I eat without restriction & no longer give food any MORAL value in terms of “good” and “bad”. 

I can eat a salad, or I can eat some cake, or I can eat both… Because of this, I no longer feel the urge to binge… because I:
Listen to my body
Eat a good balance of nourishing foods because my body & health deserves it
Honour my cravings of those not-so-nutrient-dense foods too (without guilt)
Move my body in ways I enjoy
Don't strive for an unrealistic or unhealthy body
Eat when I'm hungry… and that's healthy for me.

Healthy looks different for every single person on the face of this earth (so if you have a differing opinion that works for you, that's perfectly okay!!) 💛

It represents this message so perfectly… An indulgent chocolate mug cake that is both nutrient-dense AND delicious.

——
when blake and i spend evenings together (most nights), he sits in the kitchen when i cook myself extra meals (or cooks them for me) and walks to chipotle with me when i want a burrito bowl as a snack.  sometimes, he'll eat these extra meals or snacks with me, but a lot of times he doesn't and just gives me company. do i get bothered that i eat significantly more than him even though he's got  inches and  pounds on me? no, because i know our body's dietary needs are SO individual, and if i want food, it doesn't make sense not to go get some.
——
i remember reading something along the lines of:

feeling hungry is like the urge to pee- it's your body's signal of telling you what it needs. if you honor your body by going to the bathroom when it needs to go, why don't you honor your body and eat when it needs food?

next time you catch yourself comparing what you eat to what someone else eats, feeling like you “shouldn't” eat more, or judging yourself for eating, ask yourself “do i judge myself when I need to pee more than someone else? do i beat myself up every time i feel the urge to go? do i think it's better to push off peeing until you just can't hold it any longer?” if you answer no, why don't you apply that same logic to feeling hungry?
——
p.s. i know the comparison isn't exactly equal, and there's a lot of additional science that i'm not acknowledging here, but i found this comparison to be light-hearted, easy to comprehend, and possibly helpful in moments of doubt, so i thought i'd share :)

Doc ID: 7232, distribution: 1.0 ; eating disorders are complicated. they don't exist in a vacuum. what feels like an incredibly intimate battle is the opposite. when you're sick, every person in your life is too. nobody is untouched by your pain. and this is the heaviest burden.

i was  years old when my relationship with food, exercise, and my body turned toxic. i was an older sister, a daughter, a best friend, a teammate. yet all i ever thought about was me. i planned every meal out for weeks in advance. i wondered how many calories i burned walking to class. i tugged at the waistband of the jeans sliding off my hips, wanting more of me to disappear when there was nothing to spare. 

my sisters, my parents, my best friend, my teammates and coaches- they fell to the outskirts of my life. i had no time in my day to uphold relationships. how could i? when i passed every waking second running circles in my mind over a scoop of peanut butter i ate last week?

i isolated myself. my eating disorder was safe when nobody was around to challenge it. nobody to ask, “didn't you already work out today?” or “why aren't you eating?” or “are you okay?”. in the beginning i missed these people. i missed their love. but my ED promised me great things in their absence, so i let them go. 

i actively struggled with my ED for  years.  years of pain and misery and throwing fits and screaming matches.  years of running away from dinners in public.  years of skipping my sisters' recitals and games, because i would be forced to eat or miss a workout.  years of projecting pain onto everyone, even though at the time this never crossed my mind. 

i thought because i physically isolated myself, that my ED was contained. but it spread like wildfire. i only know this in hindsight, and it hurts, to see colors where i only saw black and white. 

my family and friends hurt deeply for me. with me. my mom used to always say a mother is only as happy as her saddest child. to this day that moves me to tears. 

we never hurt alone, even if we try our best to do just that. if you can't bring yourself to heal for YOU, then at the very least do it for someone else. i promise they feel your pain.

 One of the shitty things I've learned about restricting is that  
 It leads to binges, but not just because you're hungry. 
It was easier to restrict when you started, want to know why?
Because now you have a hobby that centers around food You don't just get to focus on restriction and not eating, because the subject of food is your life now. 
If you train yourself to think about food all the time, that's a habit now.
 If your every thought centers around what, when, and how you are allowed to eat next, you are going to fail because now your brain is trained to think of food constantly.
The only way to do this without a binge is if you train yourself to forget. Do whatever it takes to forget.
Meal plan (and log) days in advance and have your meals boxed up, day labeled, and easy to bring so you don't think about them as much.
Focus on methods of distracting yourself from food instead of planning around it obsessively.
Again DISTRACT don't obsess
Replace this food hobby you have with all of the better hobbies you'd wish you had. Read, sew, do art, write, do photography, do math or something. Whatever kind of hobby you wish you would do more, do that instead of revolving around food.

If you don't train yourself to stop thinking about food planning all of the time you will binge.

 Do you want to be the kind of person who is talented, intelligent, graceful, well read, and artistic, on top of being skinny? 
 - 
 Or do you want to be that one weirdo who everyone can tell is obsessed with food who seems to eat very little one day and then eat enough for  people and cry about it the next? 
Train yourself to distract from instead of revolve around it.
 Train yourself to stop thinking about it at all or it will come back to bite you as a binge. 
You are what you think about.

Doc ID: 2455, distribution: 0.49282642695990936 ; Reminders that have helped me eat more mindfully, flexibly & without guilt 👇

🥯 Food gives your body the energy to dance, lift heavy things, heal injuries, fight viruses, stand on your own two feet, to read, think, breathe & be.

🍪 Yes, food is fuel & it's important to give your body good quality food, but it's also for enjoyment too.

🌮 You haven't “ruined” anything by giving into your cravings. In fact, honouring your cravings when you have them will likely help you eat it in moderation & not get to a point where you're obsessing over it & overindulging later. 

🍕 Just because food is there doesn't mean you have to eat it all. If you're getting full, you can have a few cookies & put the rest in the pantry, or if you're eating out, ask for a take-away container. Remembering there's no urgency or wastage helps reduce the FOMO which causes a lot of us to keep going until we finish it all.

🍔 The human body is amazing, it's constantly responding to what you put into it, including your thoughts! I'd argue that feeling extreme guilt after eating a burger will likely do more harm to your mental health than that burger could actually do to your physical health. 

🧘🏻‍♀️ Try eating more mindfully, not mindlessly. To me, eating mindfully is acknowledging my hunger, listening to it, enjoying what I eat & then also listening to the fullness cues that my body sends me when I've had enough.

🥂 Just because you've eaten a less nutritious meal doesn't mean you have an unhealthy diet. “Your dosage is your poison” AKA having too much of anything probably isn't great, but finding that right balance of what works for you & makes you feel good is key!

🍌 Eating too little can cause you to feel tired, down, lack motivation & cause your metabolism to adapt/slow down. It's so important to eat ENOUGH, so that you can function optimally!

🥒 Your body IS going to fluctuate & change over the years. It's inevitable. So be kind to yourself. If you want to make changes, fine! But please don't risk your health for a physical appearance. It's your home & the only one you'll have. Treat it well 💖

So why bother. Literally. Why bother with the constant suffering if it changes nothing about how you feel. Eat. Eating fuels your brain. It fuels your cells to do their cellular job. If youre trying to survive on nothing you will feel like trash emotionally and physically. Why are you so fucking depressed??? Cuz your brain cant take the bullshit. Any brain surviving on XXX will % be a very upset brain. You cant Happy yourself out of that. You dont have the energy to do that. Fucking eat. The biggest hurdle but the most important step to recovery, is letting go of a sick body. You NEED to gain, you need to let go of controlling your body. A healthy body is nourished. A healthy brain doesnt obsess over sizes and numbers. Its not that simple yes it is. Eat. Force your Ed to shut the fuck up. Cry if you need. Scream if you need. But just fucking eat. Your emotional well being, physical wellbeing, and mental health will all improve as you begin actually feeding your brain and body. Duh. Fucking duh. I absolutely see where you're coming from, and being where you're supposed to be physically works wonders on your mind - but in order to really let go of a sick body, you'll need more than just nutritional restoration. I knew I had to eat enough to keep my body alive for years, but the lack of resources for my mindset just invalidated the hell out of me and kept me sicker. You can't recover without taking care of the physical aspect first, but that can only go so far without needing mental help to cope with all of that.If I'm taking your post too literally, I apologize.
I definitely think getting therapy cannot be ignored in recovery. Absolutely people need mental help to get better. Its the physical part a lot of people tend to slack on. Just therapy isnt enough. You cant heal unless you work on both your brain and your body.

in the past when i'd travel, i'd feel the need to “prepare” beforehand and would be scared about gaining a few pounds during. while it's definitely possible that i gain some weight when i vacation, the real question is how does that matter??? and the answer is that it doesn't because gaining weight isn't a bad thing!! i also trust that my body knows how to take care of itself, and if ~health~ is the concern, i trust that whatever food my body craves when i'm back at home (this is not just limited to fruits and veggies) and weight my body decides it wants to be at (whether it's less, more, or the same) is what's healthiest for me.

you are meant to have fun on vacation!! whatever that looks like for you, choose it, enjoy it, and remember that you don't have to let intruding thoughts about food or your body take up more space than they need to.

She said she definitely wasn't saying I needed to lose a couple of pounds.  “Faith, listen, this is my responsibility though, what I said and what happened. I'm not trying to put it on you in saying this. I'm just trying to explain where I think I was coming from. I need to take it to supervision and work out what was going on for me.” I carried on by saying how I felt she wanted me to stay thinner and was worried about me getting fat. That she was policing me to make sure I didn't gain too much weight, and how that feels just like what my mum did. T said she didn't mean to be doing that at all and she was really sorry. I said in all the time we had been working together, which is  years, I have never been anywhere near overweight. Gaining too much weight has never been a problem, so I don't know why she kept talking about losing weight. I have enough of a drive in my head to lose weight without T joining in. I said again that if I start talking about needing to lose weight, it's % that it's the eating disorder talking. T got that.  “So when you said you had got to X weight and it felt uncomfortable, you just needed me to tell you that you would be ok, that you could tolerate it.” I nodded. Finally she understood. Even though I know I had said almost those exact words to her last week and she missed it completely, this time she heard me.

Doc ID: 9547, distribution: 1.0 ; one of the most underrated aspects of food freedom and intuitive eating: eating boring foods

today has been a busy and tiring work/study day for me, and one of the many things that intuitive eating has allowed me is the ability to NOT need food to always feel exciting or “hit the spot” perfectly.

in the past, i always felt like every meal or snack i had needed to be exactly what i wanted otherwise the food felt “wasted”, but now that food feels abundant, and my brain knows that there's always more food available and coming, i don't need everything i eat to feel ✨amazing✨.

sometimes, that means eating pizza for lunch even if it's not what i'm craving because it's what's being served at a meeting. sometimes, that means making a recipe, not having it turn out well, but eating it anyway. sometimes, that means eating cold mediocre leftovers because they're there. sometimes, that means going out to eat, not seeing anything on the menu that sounds super great, but ordering something and enjoying the meal experience.

today, that's meant throwing random stuff that doesn't really go together on a plate because it's fast and convenient.

food freedom allows for so many fun and exciting moments with food, but when food is also JUST FOOD, not EVERY experience needs to be one of them.

Doc ID: 9750, distribution: 1.0 ; contrary to popular belief, i strongly believe that binge eating disorder is also a disorder of restriction.

based on my personal experience, other people's testimonies, and the research literature analysis that i've done, frequent binge eating is very often a result of restriction, and it's essentially your body's survival tactic. if your body thinks that it's starving or going to starve, and there's food available everywhere around you it's going to instinctively want to eat everything (think: at the beginning of quarantine when everyone excessively stocked up in fear). it's not a lack of willpower, but rather, your body trying to help you. when guilt followed by restriction (even if it's mental restriction) occurs after a binge, this can cause a repeated cycle to occur. breaking out of this cycle isn't a matter of willpower around food, but rather a matter of breaking the restriction that leads to the binge eating.

i think there's a lot of stigma around binge eating-  according to @neda, binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder, yet in the recovery community on this platform, it seems to be the least talked about.  all disordered eating struggles are valid, and if you are struggling with binge eating, let me tell you that binge eating in and of itself is NOT a bad thing, so you don't deserve to let the fear, guilt, and anxiety of binge eating consume parts of your life.

give yourself permission to let go and move forward after a binge, be the supportive and empathetic friend to yourself that you have the power to be, and if you binge again, it doesn't mean you've failed, so keep going. the goal isn't to never over eat again, to even never binge eat again, or to control the way you eat at all because the more distant i get from my ED, the more i realize that the goal has never been about what or how i eat. the goal is to not let your eating control you, so that you can live your life to its fullest.

Doc ID: 15215, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: You say your friends staged an intervention but how? Did they notice a difference in you? I only ask because I want to talk to my colleague about her eating disorder Answer: It all unfolded over a long period of time. They watched me lose a lot of weight after the birth of d over  months or so. I was deep deep in denial of a problem. Then I lost control of restricting and started bingeing and purging and regained some weight. At this point I confided in two friends because despite my best denial, I knew the purging wasn't normal. I never really stopped purging but with some accountability I got it a bit more under control. A couple of years passed in which the eating disorder mostly flew under the radar, before several emotionally difficult events all occurred within a couple of weeks ago and sent me into a total downward spiral. I'd been able to speak about the eating disorder to a couple of other friends by this time and they were all speaking to each other (I found out later) as to how to help me. One friend had a contact at our church who was a therapist and to cut a long story short (she did also try and pushed me to try the local eating disorder charity for help) she spoke to the therapist, made an appointment and then rang me up and told me what was happening. She picked me up in her car and drove me to the appointment then sat in the waiting area till I went in. Then she did it again the week after.  And that was how I ended up in therapy.It's very difficult to talk to someone out of the blue about an eating disorder. For a long time, the more my friends tried to challenge me, the more I dug my heels into denial. One of the more effective things anyone did was to say “I can see you're struggling, if you want to talk about it, I'm here.” She then refused to enagage in any of my arguments that I was fine, just repeated that when I was ready, I could let her know and we'd meet up for a chat. I hope some of that is helpful for you with your colleague.

Doc ID: 15698, distribution: 0.5725223417771181 ; Therapy .. // ways therapy can help with disordered eating  We started with going through the list of ways therapy can help with disordered eating. We were going to do this last week but then it got sidelined by T's retirement news, so we agreed that we would look at it this week. Here's the list as we discussed it. . Regular eating - It has taken several years to achieve this, but I think this is now pretty good. We talked about how completely chaotic my eating was when I started therapy and how it's been two steps forward, one step back a lot of the time but that we finally got there and have stayed there for a few years now. I acknowledge that I still miss a meal here or there but not very often and generally it's due to life getting in the way rather than intentionally choosing to restrict. My regular eating really is quite stable. T said she had observed every time we fostered a new baby, meals went a bit wonky and eating disorder thoughts crept in and so although I do get back in track, I just need to be aware that's a vulnerable time and be careful. . Fear foods - I'm not afraid of fat any more, I do quite well eating things with fat in now. I'm more afraid of carbs now but I do eat some and I know if I am doing exercise I need more carbs because it feels much better to exercise with adequate fuel. This is how we got onto the hot chocolate conversation. I have a more general fear of deviating from my routine of  meals, and I find it really difficult to permit myself to eat extra spontaneous calories between meals.  . Bingeing, purging, overexercising - I haven't thrown up for years now, December  was the last time. T said “And you never really had a problem with laxatives, did you?” And I looked at her. Uh, maybe not since I've been seeing you, but before that I did have quite a bad laxative habit.  . Learn to manage emotions. T said “Yes you've got lots better at that. Especially managing emotions here in the therapy space, you didn't used to be able to do that. If I said something that upset you, you couldn't tell me. But now look, you can tell me that what I said isn't helpful!” I used to get overwhelmed when things happened in my life - my eating disorder was very good at numbing all that out, and after I started eating again, then when things went wrong I didn't have any coping strategies. I used to be really dependent on T to help regulate my emotions in a crisis. But I don't think I've needed her to do that for quite a while now. . Understand your past. Well I think we've talked about a lot of things, I guess there's always more stuff you could talk about but I think I'm doing ok. T agreed that we have thought about my past together a lot and she thinks I understand it quite well. . Root out faulty thinking patterns - T said she knows I still have some faulty thought patterns. She said maybe we'll come back to this one! . Improve body image. I said that I don't think I have a terrible body image. There's parts of my body that I don't like but I try to accept them because I like what my body can do. I like being strong and able to run fast and feel fit. T had some different idea of what body image meant that she though I still struggled with, but I can't remember what it was now.

I'm on the fence all the time and wonder what is it that will give me that push to choose full on recovery.  Answer: I don't think there was ever a magic moment where I said right! everything is recovery from this point! When I started therapy, all I wanted to do was get control over my bingeing and purging. I wanted to be able to eat like a normal person - go out for a meal without it turning into a disaster. I didn't want to stop restricting or gain any weight though. Gradually as one aspect improved and I felt better, I was motivated to work on the next thing. I discovered how nice it was to live without all the negative impacts of restriction - to feel warm again! to not be snappy with my family! That motivated me not to fall back and to keep pressing forward.My therapist has been a big help, gently pushing me forward all the time and holding my progress when I slip back.I think what I'm saying is for some people there is a moment where they fully commit to full recovery and just go for it, and that's fantastic. I'm more of a little by little person, so taking baby steps towards recovery worked better for me. I feel like it's built me a solid foundation so that even when I slip, I have lots of ground underneath to catch me. Different things work for different people so only you know what will work for you and also you may need some trial and error to see what that is. But don't do nothing! Take the risk and try something and see how it goes. If it doesn't feel right at least on some level, try something else. Go for it x

Doc ID: 9534, distribution: 0.7098117142896134 ; when i first started my food freedom journey, i honestly didn't think i'd ever actually desire eating vegetables because for a long time into my food freedom journey, vegetables just didn't sound appetizing.

backstory: i restricted my food intake for years, and for a lot of those years, i also struggled with binge eating disorder that was perpetuated by restriction (physical and mental) and feelings of guilt and shame.  restriction for me didn't mean that i didn't eat, but rather, i saw the foods i ate in numbers, and vegetables were something i was constantly eating in very large quantities because they simply meant i got to eat more volume. 

when i finally decided to listen to and honor my hunger and cravings, it felt like the only foods i wanted to eat were the foods i would binge on - aka all the things i viewed as “bad” and would restrict - and i was always eating them in what seemed like extremely excessive amounts.

i remember thinking i was becoming an unhealthy person by honoring my hunger and cravings, but i can look back and confidently say that doing so and releasing all expectations of what intuitive eating “should” look like was the healthiest thing i ever did for myself.

it took time and patience, but now that my body trusts me to honor it, vegetables are a food i actually ENJOY eating, and gentle nutrition is something i'm able to incorporate with no feelings of morality attached.

Doc ID: 9127, distribution: 1.0 ; recent question: do you have tips for food that reduce your appetite?

here's the secret... ALL foods reduce your appetite because your appetite tells you that you need food! when on a plant based or honestly any way of healthy eating, eating a “regular” and “healthy” amount might be difficult for you because you're basing “regular” off of someone else!!! I used to feel weird about eating so much more than my friends during school especially when we'd go out to eat and they'd get full from  tacos but i'm over here still shoving my fifth taco in my face (recalling those post high school taco tuesday-days). it took some time to come to terms with it but the way your body responds to food is so different than the way mine will and the way your parent's will. the healthy and regular amount YOU need is dependent on how you feel.

giving yourself the unconditional permission to eat might seem scary because you may fear you won't stop eating— but you will!! research shows that people will tire of eating the same kind of food (habituation): the more a person is exposed to a particular food the less appealing it comes. the only way to make peace with what you're eating is to go through the experience and to actually eat what you're wanting without holding back. for example if you want to eat three bowls of oats right now but will only allow yourself the “standard” one bowl of oats, your brain will keep thinking about how much it wants those extra two but shouldn't have it. one day you end up cracking and eating ............. and then beat yourself up for it. but if you allow yourself to go for however many bowls you want, there's a big chance you won't be eating  bowls every. single. time.

basically, I don't try to control what I don't have control over... and (I learned this the hard way) I don't have control over my appetite. I just have to be friends with her 😬😬

 so i kinda am purging more regularly again and it's fucking with my body, but i can't seem to be able to stop. it sucks and i'm trying this other one is ……. okay so. no, i do not want to have my health or lack thereof as a personality trait. sure it's important to get a proper nutrition, including healthy grains and proteins and fats, at the same time “joy” foods are totally fine to have. that's settled and alright. my no. issue is, though, the morality. yes, i want to be able to order a pizza and not feel guilty, but no, i do not agree with the way animals are treated in the places they get meat and cheese from. see, i don't want to restrict my body's cravings or be antisocial, but i morally absolutely am not okay with it. on top of that junk food tends to leave me feeling sick and bad, my body is not used to it and it is not considered healthy indeed, so do i still have to occasionally make myself eat it for recovery purposes? same goes for, like, chocolate. i sometimes crave it, but the actual taste always disappoints me, and sugary things give me a headache and fatigue very soon. so should i cut them out again, mostly? they never satisfy me and i feel truly bad about eating non-fairtrade chocolate! so, “health”. it certainly is fine to indulge in fun foods, not every meal needs to be % nutrient stuffed and healthy. whenever i eat junk food or sugary stuff though, i get disappointed by the taste and feel physically bad afterwards. my body is just not used to it, but it really is not considered healthy. should i listen my first cravings anyway, despite always realizing that “ew i kinda don't want that” after some seconds? or is it my ED speaking? it's all so confusing. even pre ED times, i for example was very disgusted by McDonald's. as a considerably small child (?) i stood in front of it for around  minutes, freezing, while my family was inside and having a meal. i hated their food and the scent in there, it made me feel so bad that i refused to enter  i always liked nuts as snack food, while rather disliking chips or flips, and gummy candies always made me feel sick, although i used to eat small amounts of them, while now the idea makes my stomach turn again. it feels like i am only craving these things because my ED makes them feel “forbidden”, while actually i really do not want or need them. what to do? same with soda, i actually wholeheartedly prefer water or juice, but without bubbles and nothing too sweet or it will make me even thirstier “eat what you loved as a child”, yes, i can still eat olives straight from the glass and corn in huge amounts. i don't want to restrict fast food or sweets, but they make me feel so sick. at the same time i often feel guilty and get rid of them, but not always. it feels like i am wasting meals and money on things i don't even want to put into my body, and everyone says it is unhealthy, and i never liked it, and it feels morally wrong to support these manipulative people. eurgh but i want to heal, i want to be guilt free. do i have to? i certainly have to sleep for  hours now, until i have to get up

 Tw! Weight talk I am afraid of gaining weight because of various reasons, but mostly because it will be seen by my brain as lack of control, but i know i need to and i fight against this mentality daily because: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

 NOTHING  WRONG WITH GAINING WEIGHT, no problemo at all, but some days, like today, it feels like there is and i get nervous and anxious about a future body where i weight  kilos more.  Days like these are really draining honestly, there's a pit in my stomach because i feel bad with myself because i only ate junk food or a thing with “way to many calories” and i have to constantly remind myself that:
a) IT DOESN´T MATTER, i am fine, i need those foods, i like those foods, therefore i eat them. 
b) The thought “one won't hurt” “this thing won't make me gain x kilos” is completely dumb. What if that item of food did make me gain a whole ten kilos? What about it? What's so wrong with it? 

I write it with no problem but accepting it is very hard, today i did well, i ate against my ed, but when a day like today hits where the more i eat the more anxious and self conscious i feel, i tend to avoid certain foods which is NOT OKAY, OKAY ME? There was a time in my life where eating junk food was another walk in the park, i miss those days and i want them back, so i have to continue with positive reaffirmations that i am valid and fine even after i ate those high caloric foods. 

At the end of the day, today was just a bad day, with really big victories!, but a bad day still, and like i said in a previous post i can't get mad at myself because recovery isn't linear and i am allowed to not feel my best all of the time. These feelings of self consciousness after eating “bad” food won't go away today, but if i reassure myself tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that, maybe they will :)

i eat without a ton of thought most days now. sure, i use some of my outer wisdom to help guide my choices (making sure i eat enough even when i don't “feel” hungry, eating after i workout to help my body recover, knowing what food combos make me feel my best, etc.), but for the most part, eating's pretty easy for me because i eat whatever i want whenever want.

giving myself full permission to just eat without judgment wasn't always as easy as it is for me now though. in fact, it was exhausting, hard, and scary AF.  i went through years of wanting to commit to doing it and then giving up and restricting again.  even after i finally did commit once and for all, i would still have mental battles when i would to eat more, question everything i was doing when it seemed like i had never ending hunger, and constantly debated going back to old restrictive ways.

in those moments of doubt though, you have to keep going because i PROMISE you that if you stay the path, it won't always be that way.

i gained weight doing it (spoiler alert: it's not a bad thing), and i received a few negative comments in the process, but guess what? my life is SO much better for it #foodfreedomforevaaa

I took this the other day on my solo date & left it in my drafts but I thought, you know what? This is a really important topic, I'm gonna post it.

Here I am, eating in public & now online for ,+ of you to see, right before I went dress shopping, because guess what? You don't have to avoid eating before trying on dresses. You don't have to avoid eating whatsoever. It's so important to remember that food is energy, it's the fuel that keeps your body pumping blood around your body, your brain functioning, your lungs breathing. It fuels everything your body does in every second of every day.

Not only that, it's also just really dang delicious and enjoyable, which is not a bad thing. Food is there to be enjoyed, you don't need to live on salads or opt for capsicum instead of bread. You can enjoy a balance of all the foods that are good for your body and also good for your soul.

All of this is coming from a girl who used to be afraid of everything she's doing in this video… eating out, eating a large meal, ordering what she wants from the menu, sitting alone in public, eating in front of people & eating before trying on clothes (bc the bloat is REAL after a meal) but why did I grow up seeing all of those things as something bad? Something to fear or feel ashamed of?

So please, if you're watching this & thinking “I wish I was able to do that” I'm gonna stop you right there & remind you that it all starts with a shifting of the mind, so when that thought pops up next, catch it & start saying “actually, I hold the power, and I believe I can. I know food is good for me, I know I can have a good relationship with food & this is the beginning of a full, flexible, balanced & happy life” 

If you're with me, leave a lil “💛” below 👏🏻 

Also side question, when eating a burger & fries, do you eat the burger first or the fries? Lmk with a “🍔🍟” OR “🍟🍔” or do you do what I do & alternate between everything as you go? HAHA 🍔🍟🍔🧋🍔🍟🧋

 sorry. pet peeve is people who spread germs. stay the fuck home if you dont feel good or if any of your orifices are leaking. some of us have compromised immune systems/heavy workloads/busy schedules/no health insurance and cant afford to be sick. i go out of my way to avoid getting sick. and generally im pretty good at it. have gone years and years without catching a single bug. but leave it to a college campus, a cesspit of shit, to finally get me.  
 whats most upsetting is that i cant get any food today. i had my last can of soup way earlier, well… only half. rationing the other half for tomorrow. and i can tell that the lack of food is only making me feel worse. ive gotten progressively more sick as they day goes on. i spent most of the day in bed because even being upright in a chair was a bit exhausting. now i can barely move my body. my temperature is fluctuating wildly. i feel like i wasted my entire day. well. actually. i did. i still have to get my ass downstairs to water a few plants. im just so tired. i just wish i was smarter about the last few years of my life so i wouldnt be in this position. but alas. here i am. dealin with it.  
 i keep trying to tell myself that hunger is only a temporary feeling, and it comes in waves. but man, these waves almost have me on my ass. im so sick of fighting againsg nausea. worst feeling in the world. if my teeth werent fucked id be initiating my own vomit as to make myself feel better faster, and just get it out, but its futile.  theres nothing to even bring up.

Actually, first T asked me if I wanted to keep going down the list of how I wanted things to be different between H and me, and I said I had another list for this week, but it was kind of connected to the other list. I appreciated that T remembered about the first list, because she'd forgotten about it last week. Last week was the first session back after a break and I don't think her head was quite in the game. My list for this session was  . Eating/weight,  . Texting dilemma,  . Are you following where we've come from/where we are going because last week you seemed to have forgotten.  I imagined I would get  and  out of the way quite fast and then move onto  which would lead back into the first list. In the end we never got onto  so the connection with the first list didn't get made, but that's ok. I'll start with it next week. I told T that I had weighed myself and what the number was. I always find it hard to talk numbers (for most of last year, I texted her the number weekly so that I didn't have to say it out loud) and I sometimes freeze up when it comes to actually saying it, but this week I pushed through. I talked about my carb-increasing experiment, and she was very positive about that. “You're learning to trust your body and respond to what it needs. Which is something you didn't learn in childhood. You're doing well!” I gave T a wonky smile when she said this. It is such a long learning curve but I can see that I am making progress. I often use T's words to coach myself when I'm struggling with food choices or allowing myself to eat. I remind myself I'm learning to trust my body and to eat what it needs or wants, rather than imposing external rules on it. Sometimes I manage it and sometimes I don't. The times I don't frustrate me because I know that the more I push through, the more my body and I will learn to trust each other. When I use ed behaviours rather than listening to my body, I'm making it harder for myself to achieve that trust. Still, overall I am making progress and that is really good. No one ever said it would be easy.

 T said something quite radical to me. She said “I had a thought this week. How would it feel if you were to gain to X, and then just stay there at that weight and see how it felt?” I was a bit lost for words. T has never suggested anything like that before! She knows I am really scared of weighing X. This whole therapy rupture came about because I was only a few pounds off X, and I needed T to hold me there because I was panicking about it, and unfortunately she dropped me instead.  Her suggestion really set off a firework of contradictory thoughts inside me. I will confess there was a part of me that was quite excited by the idea. The thought of this stretch opening up between the weight I am now and X, a whole lbs to potentially gain. I liked the idea of a target being that far off, and no longer having to panic when my weight goes up even just one pound from what it is now. It felt like gaining some breathing space from the eating disorder's tight control. Then of course, straight after that thought came the panic of that was all very well but how will I cope weighing X. My clothes won't fit. My bones won't feel so sharp. More fat will creep under my skin.  Even while I was panicking, part of me loves that T made this suggestion. She listened to what I said to her when we had our first conversation about the rupture, that maybe I needed to weigh more [the figure I gave in my rant would put me at a bmi of ] in order to have healthier thoughts, and that maybe even though I wouldn't feel so physically comfortable at that weight, maybe I would realise I need to weigh that in order to be free from the eating disorder thoughts.  I think me saying that really shifted her viewpoint. I've talked before on here about feeling like T wants me to stay thinner, and T valuing control over our own weight and body size. She has never really pushed me gaining weight and she has talked about not wanting me to get overweight again. But I haven't been “overweight” for  years now, and in those  years, and especially the  since I've been seeing T, my struggles have been much more with restricting and losing weight and weighing too littler. ANYWAY, all that is to say that T suggesting I consider intentionally gaining up to a weight that's higher than I've been maintaining at marks quite a change in her approach. I don't want to do it but I really like that she suggested it. And I totally see the logic behind it, that I'm terrified of being that weight, yet maybe if I got there and maintained at that weight, the number would lose its power over me. I had all these thoughts in my head during the session, although none of them were quite as clearly formed as I've written them out up there. It felt overwhelming, bits of me scared to say what other bits were thinking. Eventually I said to T, “Can we talk about something else please?” T said “Yes, of course. But before we do, can you just tell me what was difficult about that? Was it x or was it y?…. I won't ask you any more about it, but it would be helpful for me to know.” [I can't remember what the x and y options were! They might have been something like x was 'there were too many thoughts in your head and it's too hard to think about all of them right now' and y was 'that's a terrible idea and I never want to speak of it again'.] I said it was x. T said that was ok and thankyou for telling her, and then she changed the subject just like I'd asked her to. I think everything in this post was the most important part of the whole therapy session.

sometimes i forget all the pain and hardship that i've been through to get to where i am now. while i still struggle with mental health and have moments when life feels really hard, i can confidently say that my low points now are still better than my high points when i was in the depths of my eating disorder.

it can be easy to romanticize eating disorders and to think that times when you were thinner or had a sense of control, life was better. i know i've had those thoughts. truth is, life for me during my eating disorders sucked pretty hard. i was a manipulative liar, i missed out on so many experiences that i will never get to have, i couldn't develop long-lasting relationships, i was in a toxic relationship with myself, and my entire mind was consumed by thoughts around food, my body, and numbers.

when things get hard now, remember to keep choosing LIFE. going backwards isn't an option, so what are you going to with your next step forward? there is so much life out there, and you deserve to live it, like really truly live it, to its fullest. i promise the fight to break free is worth it.

what's really cool about intuitive eating and food freedom to me is how much more in tune i am with my body now. in the past, i saw food as numbers, and there was a complete disconnect between my mind and my body. i used to have  idea what meals would make me feel good, and i'd go into every meal starving and end every meal either STILL starving or absolutely stuffed- there was no in between.

i thought trying to be in control of my body by controlling my food was the way for me to take control of my life, but that false sense of control really made me become completely out of control, disconnected, unaligned, and lost.

sometimes i take how far i've come for granted, make the journey that got me to where i am seem easy, and forget to acknowledge that for a lot years, i lived with constant feelings of self-hatred, dread, hopelessness, guilt, shame, and fear that fully took over my ability to feel in tune with my own body, be my authentic self, and truly live my life.

choosing to heal can be one grueling process (i don't want to romanticize that), but i promise it really does get better. when you make decisions, ask yourself: am i just choosing to listen to my thoughts (that may or may not have my best interest in mind)? or am i truly choosing myself?

keep choosing yourself over and over and over until you feel like you again.

I can feel my brain dropping back in to those well-worn “actually I don't need to eat” pathways. There are very valid reasons why it is hard to make time to make food and eat just now (two babies, looking at you) but my eating disorder brain takes them and runs. Part of the problem is that making my own food and eating is just very low on my priority list. So if I have a spare five minutes, I figure it's not long enough to do lunch, instead I'll wash bottles or do laundry or catch up on paperwork or even just sit down and enjoy the peace with a coffee etc etc. I think the solution is to accept that food prep and eating may not happen all in one go, it may have to be done in five minute blocks.  Also because I'm so used to going for a walk before breakfast, I keep putting breakfast off because it doesn't seem right to eat it straight away when I get up. Calling myself out on that one too. Breakfast can happen at any time.  I messaged my friend last night for some accountability and today I will make sure I am more structured and intentional about getting meals in. I want to be able to rebalance myself without needing input from T, because that is what recovery is eventually about isn't it? Learning to recognise and tolerate wobbles and have the skills and my own support network to get back on track without needing professional input.

Many of you guys will know that I went through a pretty roughy period in my teens. I had serious body image issues, obsessed  over calories and severely restricted my food intake. It led me to lose friendships, lose my love for dance and lose the person that people knew as Holly. That crazy girl on YouTube you know now 🤷🏻‍♀️ I found it extremely difficult to open up about what was going on inside my head, and even now I find it hard to explain. I also had no motive to want to help myself, and I saw the rest of my life living that way. In my mind there was just this constant desire to look 'thinner' and eat less. But without any particular 'goal' when would it ever end? 
Ok . . . so THANK GOODNESS I never reached the point of having to be hospitalised. Just as I cannot tell you what triggered my eating disorder, I also don't know exactly what helped me recover. But what I do know is that it started with a change in MY mentality, and nobody else could do that but ME. I changed the way I viewed food and I changed the way I viewed my body. Food become fuel and my body was something to be appreciated, accepted and LOVED. 
Now all this has also taken time. For sure, it did not happen over night. I am also aware that many of you guys out there may have experienced something similar. I opened up about this on my channel quite a while back now, and I would really like to do more to help you. If you, yes you behind the screen right now, is struggling, then I really hope you find the strength to want to help yourself. Likewise, if you know a family member or a friend who is struggling, I hope you can try to help them as best you can.

it's christmas eve, and i know that the holiday season can be really hard for those of you who are struggling with your relationship with food. as much as i wish i could give you an easy answer for how to not binge after a large dinner or eating  cookies or how to not worry about everything that's in what you're eating, i know it's not that simple and easy.  it took me YEARS to get to where i am with food, and what eventually helped me to fully heal were letting go of the ideas that eating less was better, that different foods were “good” and “bad”, that calories were meant to be “burned off”, that gaining weight was a bad thing, etc., and trusting and committing to the process of honoring my body and giving myself *UNCONDITIONAL* permission to eat (i promise the time it takes is worth it).
——
the ability to not binge after eating multiple desserts or to go into a big meal and not even think about how many calories you may be eating isn't something that happens overnight, and real change takes time. while i don't have any quick fixes for you, i hope you remember what this time of year is really about, think about the things you hope to look back fondly on, know that it's okay to do what you need to do to protect your own peace, celebrate every small step and win you have, and give yourself the grace and compassion you deserve.

I wanted to share this with T to kind of fix it in place, and to show her how far I have come. I talked away for a long time. Several months ago, we spent quite a few weeks wrestling with the idea of me eating cake. It was something I had a huge block about and that was still causing me a lot of eating disorder thoughts. Eventually we got me to a place where I felt like I was able to eat cake, which subsequently had lots of knock on effects, such as being able to eat sweet things at home, less cravings and obsessing, less chewing and spitting etc. It felt like the final big hurdle left in recovery had now been cleared.  I said how with my eating disorder, every eating episode became separate and disconnected from every other. So I couldn't connect that what I ate or didn't eat at one meal or on one day would have a knock on effect on the next meal or next day. Eating, appetite and fuelling my body didn't “reset” every night. Eating a snack in the moment just became a very black or white choice, do I want to put these calories in my body? I couldn't connect it up to how it was just a part of the whole day of eating. But gradually that's something I've learnt to be able to do. To think about nourishing myself as a positive thing and how all these different meals and snacks combine to keep me well fuelled and healthy both mentally and physically. I said how I didn't want to say I was “recovered” because that seemed overconfident and like I was never going to stumble again. I mentioned that maybe it would be more accurate to say it was in remission. T didn't seem to have come across that concept with regard to eating disorders before. She came back to it and said that was an interesting idea. I wish now I'd asked her a bit more about this, and about what she thought.  I said that although everything was pretty good right now, I could think of situations that might knock me pretty hard. For example, if I got a stomach bug and lost some weight, I feel like I would find that really triggering and I think I could easily fall into that downward spiral. I also said that I knew that in lockdown, life was about as unchallenging as it gets, foodwise. I was eating all my meals at home, eating exactly what I chose, no meals out, no coffee shops with cake to negotiate and so on. I've got to know my body pretty well over the last couple of years, and how it responds and what it needs in various situations and activity levels, and I feel like I am able to make healthy choices for myself now.

Doc ID: 14668, distribution: 0.6170425886880868 ; Therapy .. // can anyone relate?  T said we should maybe try and focus more on how I feel in my body, in terms of energy, warmth etc, and less on weight and bmi. She can say this because I'm in a stable place with a healthy weight, so it's about learning I can trust my body and my perceptions of it. This bought up something I'd been thinking about those week, about my internalised sense of the size of my body. I thought everybody had this idea of their size, of how much space they take up. T thought it was interesting that I used the words “how much space I take up”. I said it referred to an internal frame of reference, as if looking at the body from inside it, rather than being outside it and looking at how big it is is compared to external things. I said that my sense of how much space I take up is that it's much bigger than it really is, and I wondered how to change that. T struggled to answer because she couldn't really relate to the idea of how much space we take up. In my head, I'm still about  lbs heavier than I really am. When I think about it, I can be rational and know I'm not, but my first instinct is still that I'm that size. (I haven't been that size for over  years) We didn't come to a solution, we just left it there. Having thought about it since, I might use this example for T next week: If you go to the fairground and walk past one of those silly mirrors that distorts you to make you taller, most people would know that their reflection is distorted. That's not because you have a logical conversation with yourself where you think oh I know I'm not  foot tall so that must be a distortion. It's because you have an image in your head of how you look, and so instantaneously you can know that reflection is not representative of how much vertical space you really take up. My struggle is that if the mirror distorted widthwards, I would not recognise it was distorted. The image of myself in my head is so out of whack that whenever I see my reflection, I do a double take because I am surprised at what I see. I look at women I pass in the street and I think, is that what I look like? Am I bigger than that? Smaller than that? Can anyone relate to this?

She asked me how I was finding it. I was looking down because I was feeling fed up that she wasn't really getting me, and I muttered  “It's annoying!” I don't think T expected that because she sounded a bit taken aback and gave a little laugh and said “oh… right, ok”. I smiled too. It actually was a moment of connection in amongst all the disconnect. She said “How can I be helpful to you? What do you need from me? I want to support the adult part of you to make decisions.” I got frustrated and said “Yes but it doesn't have to be one extreme or the other!” while gesturing extremes with my hands. I understand that T taking the adult role and telling me what to do, while it has a place at times, is only really a stepping stone to enabling me to look after myself more fully. But at the same time when she completely steps back and refuses to get drawn into that adult role, it feels like she has abandoned me. I sat in silence for quite a long time. Lots was happening in my head. I was feeling frustrated about how things were going. I was wondering why she hadn't asked about my weight, when we have spent so many sessions talking about it and even last session she spent some time hammering me on eating.  I managed to use the silence quite constructively. I was weighing up in my head whether to just abandon the weight conversation and talk about something else, or whether that would leave things feeling really difficult over my upcoming holiday. I thought to myself, What will be the hardest thing to manage myself next week when I don't have a session? and the answer came back in my mind that it would be T not knowing my weight and the places my brain/eating disorder might run off to with that. Eventually I spoke, although I avoided eye contact. “Uh…. it bothers me that you still don't know what I weigh. That I said I was worried about telling you it but now you don't seem to care whether I tell you it or not! It's hard for me to tell you it each week and I need to feel like it's non-negotiable, because that's sometimes the only way I can make myself write it. So it wasn't that I didn't want to tell you it this week, I was just scared of what you would think.” T said that she could pretty much figure out what my weight is from the other things I said about it. She made a guess and I kind of nodded slowly, till she said “lower?” I nodded and she guessed again, correctly this time. I said I didn't mean it to be that low, I knew I'd missed some meals but I'd also not missed a lot.  “I was honest when I answered your texts about eating. And it did help, you texting me, but then I felt like a terrible person because I implied everything was ok in the texts and then I went and lost a load of weight….. Here I am, supposed to be in recovery and instead I am making all these choices that aren't in line with that. I'm a terrible person.” T reminded me that recovery is never a straight line and that it's normal to have some relapses.  She was very determined not to get all parental on me, and I guess I felt uncomfortable with the changed dynamic and just kept trying to prod her back into it. She offered to text me again through the next fortnight to ask how eating was going, but I didn't feel like I deserved anymore support so I said no.  Despite all that, we ended the session on a good note. It wasn't a rupture. Just an uncomfortable session with things to think about.

Doc ID: 16841, distribution: 0.6235790357381454 ; Therapy .. // weight again  We jumped around topics a lot in this therapy session, but that felt ok. We touched on lots of things, but some didn't need more than a touch this week. Just to be brought into the room and left to consider. The first topic we talked about was my weight. I was convinced I'd gained about lbs. As soon as I change my routine or miss a weigh in, I become certain I'm getting bigger and bigger. The new jeans didn't help because they felt tight while I was wearing them in, and my brain immediately equates that to “I'm so fat”.  “I didn't get to the gym to weigh myself on Sunday evening to weigh myself because we were away for the weekend. That's why I didn't text you it. But I'm sure it's gone up. I feel huge.” “Ok… shall we talk about this now?” “I don't think there's much to say. I feel horrible.” T asks about how my clothes feel. She's trying to help me be more in touch with the size of my body without being reliant on a number on the scale. We talked about eating and whether what I call “ok” is the same as what T would call ok. “Uhh yep I think you would think it's ok. I'm eating three meals, just struggling with the snacks. I often don't feel good physically though. I know I'm not eating enough and I would be better with snacks, but my head won't let me eat them.” “Do you feel like your blood sugar is low?” “Yeah sometimes. And I go in the kitchen and look at the food… but now I'm not eating peanut butter I don't have anything else safe to snack on.” “What's helped in the past?….[pause]…. Shall I have a go at answering that for you? I think what's helped is knowing that you'll feel better if you eat more.” I nod. T suggests some things that I have eaten for snacks in the past. My brain makes excuses for all of them. A milky hot chocolate sounds the least impossible. I think because it was T who first got me into drinking that and it feels kind of nurturing to think about having one because T wants me to have one. If that makes sense. We have had versions of this whole weight conversation endless times in past therapy sessions. It only lasts - minutes but it can often be enough of a nudge to keep me on track. And it's good to check in about it each week.  In order to prevent us getting locked in an endless circular debate about eating, T says “Soo…shall we park this for now?”. I know it, I know everything she is saying, it's good to hear it again and I just need to work myself up to taking some action. So I nod, yes let's move on. I'm grateful to her for managing the session time and not insisting we thrash it out to the end. We have been in that situation before, when I needed it, but I am so much better than I was and so much more steady with my intake. I have to remember that when my intake drops below a certain level, other eating disorder behaviours rush in. Those pathways are in my brain and I'm vulnerable to falling back into them. I just never believe that my intake is that low until I start doing those other things *eyeroll* *facepalm* 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15926, distribution: 0.24610996645466257 ; Motivation to keep eating  One of the things that makes it harder for me to maintain an adequate intake in these times is that one of my big motivations for recovery has always been to have enough energy to go out to groups and to socialise. I'm naturally an introvert and very happy in my own company, so while I do enjoy going out and about and seeing friends, it does take that energy to do that. One of my lowest points when I was unwell and restricting badly was getting H to take the three girls out of the house (they were about ,  and ), and I just couldn't wait for them all to go away so I could just lie on my bed and not have to interact with anyone.  I feel a lot of shame about some of the things I wanted then, even though I know it was because I was unwell. It all motivates me to stay in recovery now, because I never want to get to that low place again. I want to have the energy to meet people, and take the baby to groups and chat with people, and to be present when I'm out with friends instead of being zoned out or completely preoccupied with food. But now with this lockdown, I can't go out and socialise with anyone. I don't need energy to be present with my friends for a couple of hours over lunch, or to go to a new baby group and make conversation with people I don't know. Of course the family are still around and we are still having Zoom conversations and I am still FaceTiming with individual friends, but all that seems to take much less extrovert energy when done from the comfort of my own home. (It still take some though!) Anyway, all that is to say that there's a bit of my brain saying “ah now, you don't really need to eat so much these days, it doesn't matter if you miss bits here and there because you don't need all that energy, you don't need to push yourself to be present with people outside your family, you can just exist in this bubble”. I totally know it's the eating disorder and I need to push back against it. It's just hard when it's been one of my core motivations to keep my intake up and now it's been knocked out from under me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15437, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // controversial  T asked “Can I say something a bit controversial?” What sort of a question is that?? As I said to T, “How do I know whether it's ok for you to say it? Because I won't know if it is until you've said it, and then if it's not ok it'll be too late!” She said that was very true. We went back and forth a bit and eventually I said “ok, say it then.” T said “So… you know that list you showed me last week about all the steps in recovery? And being able to buy yourself a snack while you're out is just about the last thing left on it… I'm wondering if you might be thinking - subconsciously, I mean - if you don't want to be able to eat cake because that would mean you would have to finish therapy.” I looked at T a bit weirdly. That honestly has not crossed my mind. If I can go out and treat myself to cake, there are still other bits and pieces of eating disorder behaviours I could choose to work on (oh gosh she knows some of the things I do, I know I have told her them) or there is other relationship stuff we could work on. I don't feel at all like being able to eat cake would automatically mean Bingo! I was done!  But of course the stupid thing about things like this when a therapist says “oh it's not your conscious mind” is that you can't win that argument. If you disagree, they just say that's because you're not aware of it.  I said to T that I didn't think that was true at all and it hadn't crossed my mind, and true to form she said something very similar to what I just wrote. I felt like the more I argued with her, the more she might think it was indeed true, so I just kind of shrugged and gave her a weak smile. I told her I still felt like I had stuff to work on in therapy if I chose to. And I didn't say this, but I am gradually more reconciled to the idea of finishing therapy at some point. It doesn't freak me out like it used to. I am ready to have a good end at some point. I don't want a therapy that is forced to end through circumstance, I want to be in control of the ending and it to be by our mutual choice. So that means we have to make that choice at some point.

I told her I'd signed up on impulse for a half marathon, and that I hope that I could train for it in a healthy way. We talked about what it might look like if it wasn't a healthy way. I said not taking rest days, running more than my training plan. She said what about if you start losing weight? You know you'll need to eat more to fuel more running. I said eating more was… difficult. We had a bit of a back and forth about that. I said I was very motivated to be able to train well and run fast and that I did think I would be able to eat adequately to do that.  T said I would need to keep an eye on my weight and I said uh actually, I want to stop weighing myself. Because I've done it every week for a year now and it's starting to feel more unhelpful than helpful. It just keeps me fixated on the number and I can't stop my urges to make it go down, no matter what it is.   I said that last year my weight had ranged over  lbs and I knew what that felt like and I would recognise if it moved outside that. T said “I think you are a good weight at the moment”, which was and is hard to hear. It definitely makes me aware of a part of me that still wants people to be concerned about me because I am “too thin”. There is a big part of me that is really really proud of myself for getting rid of a load of eating disorder behaviours, eating regularly, exercising in a healthy way and engaging in adult life as an adult. Life is so much better with all these things in place. But there's still that little part that wants to be looked after and taken care of and doesn't like to hear “hey you're doing really well, we don't need to worry about that anymore”. Anyway, that is my self awareness which I can use to understand why I feel certain ways while also knowing that I don't need to act on it. T was understanding of my wish not to weigh myself so often, and she said that towards the end of last year she thought I had got a bit hyperfocused on the numbers again, so maybe it would be a good idea to step away from them. I do imagine I'll still weigh myself, but maybe only once a month or so, and just to see if it's still in the range rather than getting caught up in the exact numbers. We finished off by talking a bit about goals for the year. T suggested a goal that I would know what I was feeling in my body and how that related to my emotions. I'm a bit unsure what exactly she means but I'm happy to go with it. Then we got on to talking about finishing therapy, which I wrote about in a previous post, and that was the end of the session.

i struggled with a disordered eating for years, and can say with confidence that the worst thing i ever did for myself was allow this to keep me from being the person i could have been. the person i am now. 

i am healthy and happy and strong. i am free and balanced and accepting— of my body, my mind, my heart, my life. of the things i can control, and more so of the things i can't. i eat nutritious foods that nourish my physical body but i also leave room for the fun foods, the ones that nourish my heart. i move my body to feel its strength, not to punish or redeem food i ate (and enjoyed!). i accept my body and its appearance with love, with gratitude, every single day.

this week is ED awareness week. i want to remind everyone that struggles with food are not about food at all. in fact, food is simply a medium through which the deeper rooted issues flow. they build up innocently over time, and take everything you have within in you (and more) to heal from. 

the person i was always meant to become was someone with a deep and relentless love for life. i wasn't always her, but i am now, and i can't ever imagine not being her again. life is sweet. i'm thankful. 

sending endless love to anyone struggling in their relationship with food and their body. i see you, and feel for you, and can promise you this isn't the person you could be in this lifetime. there's more for you 💘

Doc ID: 13506, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: You suffered with binge eating disorder? How did you get over it? Answer: toethefinishline:
Okay. So I am not exactly sure how I beat it- like there is not a simple solution or anything! And it takes time. You will gradually get better and relapse every once in awhile but hopefully you can get to the point i am at today! Binge free for over a year and a half!
To start I came to the realization that some days I would be eating - calories all of them processed, sugary, non nutritional, gross foods. And before I had the disorder I would restrict, eating no more than - calories per day if even that many. So this was a HUGE change for me! I went from  pounds to  over the  months! And from basically no calories per day to a few thousand! It was awful! And I was trying to look good for my vacation so I told myself every day that today is the last day I will binge- tomorrow I will fast! But each day I would try to fast and be consumed by thoughts of food and eating. And it continually got worse! I remember this one specific instance sitting in my last class for the day that had just started and I craved cheese cake. The class dragged on so slowly and I couldn't concentrate because I just wanted to eat and when I came home I ate the rest of the cheese cake in my freezer and I felt so sick. And I thought “okay. the cheese cake is gone so the temptation is gone and starting now I will fast” but of course dinner came and I found something else to eat! Some nights I would have sugar cravings and I would go to the kitchen get the flour, sugar, vanilla, and water and make a disgusting cookie dough type of thing that was pure sugar and eat it just like that ! it was awful but I just could not control it!
I finally came to the realization that i didn't have to fast or diet or restrict to lose weight. I mean I was eating over  calories almost everyday so obviously if I just cut down to  or  (a healthy amount) i would still lose weight. From there I completely switched everything! All of my goals! I no longer wanted skinny. I wanted fit. I redid my tumblr, unfollowed any triggering/unhealthy blogs and joined the fitblrs(bet decision ever!) And I made some friends and found a weight loss buddy and we made healthy plans together! I made a new grocery list consisting of fruits, veggies, healthy dinners, and little treats. So i would still enjoy myself and not feel deprived. I began exercising again - since i rarely did while i had binge eating disorder. I managed the stress of school by not procrastinating as much and doing my work during lunch and free time in class so when I came home I didn't have so much to do. And I made new goals for myself. I wanted to become a runner, stop binging, eat healthy by choice, become a weight lifter, to be fit, to have abs, and have better endurance. They are all still my goals and I have only completed a few. this all takes time but the good thing is that my binging has ended.
I found that once I centered my goals and my life on health- I stopped focusing on the scale and on calorie counting it helped! The numbers do NOT matter! The number I was concerned with was how many days I went binge free! And don't start by aiming to never binge again! Start small. Go for  days, then , then  - whatever you want! just aim to go longer than you did before!
Why I stopped focusing on the scale and calorie counting: The number on the scale does not matter at all ! End of story. It doesn't measure your self worth or your beauty. It is just a number. There is nothing to it. You need to focus on how you feel and what you eat. I NEVER calorie count anymore because the numbers got way too obsessive for me! I would try to have low sodium, low fat, low carbs, low sugars, but enough calories. and it was impossible! And the days I saw that I had too many of one of those I would be like “fuck it! i have already ruined my day so i will just eat whatever i want” then i would binge! And the days i didn't eat enough I would try to make dinner larger and then it would be huge and awful and it would make me binge then too! So I stopped counting calories!
I just made a healthy meal plan of foods that I should try to eat more often: oatmeal, fruits, veggies, green smoothies, luna bars, greek yogurt, eggs, etc. And I started to make a meal plan. Once I got into the habit of the meal plan it would get easier. Some treats I enjoy are soy ice cream and pita chips- I usually have one treat a day and i don't even portion it typically. I eat what I want and put it away. I figure it is better than what i was doing before and I need to enjoy myself. If you set too many restrictions on yourself you will binge! I tried going vegan but I realized how restrictive that is and it made it really hard so I stopped because I knew I wasn't ready for it and I honestly don't think I am ready even now after so long. I do NOT diet because I know that I will binge. This is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE. You need to be healthy for you and only for you. So you will feel better and be healthier, as a result you will look better too! But you cannot be doing this for the looks! And you need to realize this won't happen overnight! You must be patient and be proud of yourself ! It is such a wonderful feeling going days without binging and you will be so proud and the exercise will make you feel great and eating right will too!
So for main points:
Do NOT count calories.
Do NOT diet/restrict at all!
Do NOT weight yourself.
Find a weight loss buddy.
Drink lots of water!
Treat yourself everyday to something you love!
Set new and healthy goals for yourself!
Focus on being fit and healthy - not skinny.
Fill your tumblr with healthy motivation!
You can even open up to your family and get their help for this! I am sure it would've helped if I had told mine but I couldn't and they still don't know! But they will be able to support you with healthy eating and maybe even find a nutritionist you can talk to!
Also clear out all tempting foods that cause you to binge! I no longer have cheese cake at my house nor do I buy fiber one mocha bars (because my mom would buy them and i would eat one then always eat the whole box. I still don't trust myself with them so I just leave them at the store! Someone else can enjoy them!).
I hope this answer helps! I am not sure if it will - let me know if there is anything I didn't answer or any other way I can help ! I am sorry I kind of rambled but I was trying to cover everything and as I said this is a really hard question to answer!

Doc ID: 1909, distribution: 1.0 ; peoniesandprosecco:The benefits of recovery are life changing and phenomenal, but the process of recovery is agonizing and arduous. And I think that is such an important distinction to be made. When I first entertained the idea of recovery, I thought it was going to feel great. I thought it would be invigorating to try my fear foods and gain my life back. I thought I would feel empowered and rewarded. The truth of the matter is that recovery, especially the early stages, feels absolutely horrible. I think it feels even worse than being in the eating disorder. Everything about it is hard. Everything about it feels wrong. Giving up your eating disorder and trying to stay in recovery takes everything out of you and beats you down. The process is ugly and oftentimes, you question if it's really worth it. You even wonder if it's possible. It is. But here is the key: you have to accept and honor the fact that it will not feel good but know that it is still worthwhile. Each time you tolerate the discomfort of a recovery-oriented choice, you weaken the eating disorder. It is in the small moments of keeping yourself out of the bathroom after dinner, reaching for the granola bar instead of the stick of gum, and saying “yes” to time with a friend instead of a gym session, that give you your power back. The choice to move towards recovery will not always be comfortable but it will be available.

Doc ID: 16248, distribution: 0.42172644563683037 ; We started this week's therapy session talking about my Big Hunger. I'm guessing it's related to running, but it's so unsettling. I don't know what is the right amount to eat to appease it. “I think I've just made life difficult for myself, because I was quite stable before Christmas and now I've just unsettled everything with the running.”  “Hmm…. but that's what happens with life, Faith. It doesn't stay the same. I actually think this could be a good thing because you're challenging yourself and giving yourself a chance to learn how to cope with change.” We talked about what to eat to meet the increased requirements of running, and discussed ways to increase my intake as an experiment to see how much I need to eat. T is very keen I try and listen to my body and learn to respond the its hunger cues and trust that it's ok to give it what it needs. She thinks this is a good opportunity for me to practice all these skills.  I'm happy to work on increases collaboratively with her and I didn't feel like I was fighting with her over eating more, as I have done so often in the past. I want to have energy to run, and I want to recover well after a long run and minimise my chances of getting injured, and I know that nutrition plays a big role in this. One morning this week I tried to do a speedy run before breakfast and it was SUCH hard work. No fun at all. Every run is a learning curve.  So, I'm really motivated to eat to meet my increased needs, but the disordered side is that I don't want to eat any more than I absolutely need to. It's like I want to straddle that fine line between feeling hungry and not feeling hungry, knowing I'm not being “excessive”. I still can't quite let go of that control. I don't think the urge to do this is going to just disappear, and probably I have learn to manage it rather than keep waiting for it to be cured.

Doc ID: 14662, distribution: 0.4449479109902358 ; Therapy .. // no shame  I told T about my mum's fat-shaming talk over Christmas. T was quite taken aback. I said what I'd realised is that my mum says things like this in normal conversation, like it's not an outrageous or contentious things to say. She has been doing this all my life and for a lot of that time, I have accepted what she said as fact. I was so busy aligning myself with her and absorbing her opinions as my own that I never questioned the rightness of them. I said to T that hearing my mum speak like that actually helped me have a bit more compassion for myself. That I still feel a lot of shame over developing an eating disorder and I still think “I'm so stupid”. When I hear my mum say things like that and realise that she's been saying them all my life and I've just been soaking them up as fact, I think it's no wonder that I got mixed up ideas about food and size.  T said “Absolutely! There is no shame in you developing an eating disorder. I'm not surprised at all that you developed an eating disorder. In fact, given everything, I would have been surprised if you *hadn't* developed an eating disorder.” The truth is, I didn't really stand a chance in developing healthy thoughts and beliefs about food and weight. I'm trying to hold on to that belief. T's words make me feel a bit less stupid and shameful.  I paused and thought about this, and T said “It looks like something is simmering away in your brain there…” I said “Well, it's like two viewpoints of it isn't it? Over here there's you saying it's understandable and no shame in it. But over here is everyone else looking in from the outside, seeing a perfect family and nice parents, and wondering what could possibly be wrong. That's where the shame lies.” T said, really powerfully, “Ah but they don't know your story. You have invited me in to your childhood. So I can say from that place of knowing you, that it's understandable and there isn't any shame in it.” I replied “Uh uh… I guess I worry too much about what the other people think though.” T said that is also understandable from growing up the way I did, that I didn't ever learn to trust my own feelings and spent my time trying to work out what I should feel based on what everyone else felt.

Doc ID: 15453, distribution: 0.31379185831279177 ; Big step. Huge.  Last night I told my entire church small group (about  people) about my eating disorder and about being in therapy. The leaders of my group asked H and I last week if one of us would lead the talk-y bit for  minutes and straight away I felt a pull to share part of my journey. I didn't talk about my eating disorder other than to say that was why I ended up in therapy, then I spoke about how my relationship with my therapist has helped me experience some of what our relationship with God is meant to be like.  I spoke about how our relationship with God is often based on our experience of our relationship with our parents. I said my parents weren't perfect and it had taken me several years of therapy to be able to say that. That they were good parents but they got some things wrong. They got things wrong rather than me being wrong. Everyone was super silent while I was talking (we were on zoom) and then when I finished, they were all so so kind. People had time to give a little feedback or comments and someone thanked me for being brave enough to share and lots of people said really nice things and a couple said they'd even got tears in their eyes, and I got a bit overwhelmed and had to move off camera and do a bit of self-coaching to stay in the moment. After the group ended, lots of them sent me text messages both on the group chat and individually, but I was still feeling quite overwhelmed after being so vulnerable that I couldn't read them until this morning. I actually can't believe I said everything I did. There were so many years where my eating disorder was locked up so tightly and I had a huge huge fear of anybody finding out that I flatly refused to get any help at all. All I had learnt as a child was that being vulnerable was seen as weakness and a thing to be scorned, and it has been a long uphill struggle to overcome that. Now I'm here, telling  people most of whom I don't know very well but who are not anonymous strangers, about it and about being in therapy for  years. I won't say it felt comfortable, but it felt natural and the right thing to do and I'm proud of myself for being able to share some of my journey. H says that I should tell T, and she would be really really proud of me. I can't decide whether it would feel to weird to tell T because it's literally talking about how she has parented me. I've had a bit of a post-vulnerable hangover all day, a really bad headache and feeling quite icky and still overwhelmed by everyone's niceness. As well as my self-critical part picking everything I said to pieces, I rambled too much, I conned everyone into being nice to me, I was attention-seeking. I texted T and told her I had done something huge but I didn't want to tell her it by text, and I thought about asking for a phone call but we messaged back and forth a bit and I think I will talk about it in session next week with her.

Doc ID: 16060, distribution: 0.3027182332053129 ; Question: I KNOW eating disorders aren't a teenage phase and yet I feel so stupid and pathetic to still be struggling with this at my age (late s). I feel like I just need to grow up, I'm so frustrated at myself. It's so embarrassing to admit to an eating disorder at this point, that I'm an adult that still doesn't know how to eat. I know the ins and outs of my ED, I'm so self aware but it makes no difference as I'm still just as stuck in it. I feel so alone in being a young didn't know how to feed myself either, thanks to a childhood full of messed up messages about food. My therapist has taught me how to eat, how to not be scared of food and how food is so much more than calories. Especially as adults, food is part of connections and relationships.Telling ourselves we need to grow up isn't really helpful. You wouldn't tell a small child to just hurry up and grow up. It's a process that happens quite gradually and naturally if the right environment is there. What happens when we force ourselves to “grow up” is we just paper over the cracks and force ourselves to do what we need to do, and it generally works for a short period of time…. until it all falls through again. We need to build up that solid foundation underneath it and that takes time and an acceptance of where we are starting from.As an adult, no one is going to force us to do that, or come along and save us. We have to find it within ourself to take those steps, to do the difficult stuff, to risk connecting with the world. Or we can continue to exist in this eating disordered way for the rest of our lives. There's lots of adults of all ages out there recovering, you are definitely not alone. I'm sorry that you feel like you are. Keep fighting and taking baby steps. You can do it, but only you can do it. Best wishes x

Doc ID: 14634, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // third instalment   Welcome to the third and final instalment of this weeks therapy session! I had five things on my list for this session, and so far we'd got through two of them and we had ten minutes left 🙄 I looked at the remaining three things and thought which one could I get through in the time, and then I froze up for a minute while I ran through opening lines for the options in my head. It's frustrating when I do this, because taking a minute to decide what can be said in ten minutes means that I end up with only nine minutes to say it in. Why can't I just be a talky talky external processor?! I went with my debate about my weight. I've done really well throughout  barely weighing myself and it's been much better, so from that I conclude it's mentally much healthier for me not to know my weight and that I can trust my body and I can trust myself to fairly accurately predict what my weight is doing because I know my body well now. However as soon as I think about releasing the need to know my weight, the fear and shame of being  years old again and being sent to weigh myself and being so ashamed and horrified by the number comes back to haunt me. I explained all this to T, and she reflected it back to me and missed the point a bit so I clarified and she adjusted and then she did get it. We were down to the last few minutes at this point, but she said “Maybe that's something you could ask God to help you with?” I totally understand her bringing it back to God. We are both Christians and I do believe that God can heal our minds and bodies, but when she said it, I felt a flash of frustration. I didn't say it out loud, but what I thought was “Ugh T only said that because she doesn't know what to say” followed by “I don't want God to fix it, I want you to fix it!” We were out of time, in fact over time, at that point so there wasn't any time to talk more about it. T did say maybe there's more to be said on the subject and we can continue with it next week if I want to.

well, for some people, it's like that.

but for most others, reconnecting with their soul's purpose doesn't make their everyday LOOK much different but it changes how they FEEL about it.

finding your purpose gives you confidence to do what you love

it turns the everyday into extraordinary

it makes this body worth healing

it makes this life worth living.

it's not a one-size-fits-all and that's what makes the journey so powerful and unique for everyone!

Doc ID: 15543, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Hiya, hope you're well! I hope this is okay to ask, but I basically was wondering for some advice; I feel like I'm having a minor ED relapse after a year but it's come quite out of the blue & I also feel like I'm too old for this now. I have a problem with taking everything as a sign, and I keep feeling like I should properly relapse (confirmation bias most likely, I know). it's like I want to but I know I shouldn't. I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for, but I don't really know where to turn Answer: I promise you there's nothing out there in the universe that is telling you to relapse, no matter how your brain is interpreting it.Can you try and focus on the positives of recovery and how much better you feel now compared to when things were really bad? Think about all the hard work you've done to get to this point, you must have overcome a lot. Don't let that go. It's ok to want to relapse. I get those urges sometimes too. Try not to engage with them too much. Maybe just think…. oh that's interesting, I wonder why I'm feeling like this…. and then see if you can work out what's triggered it and how you could work through that in a different way.Hope that helps. Stay strong anon. You've got this x

Doc ID: 23548, distribution: 1.0 ; need-my-pills:  Something I'm learning through recovery is the need for aggressive self advocacy, even when you don't want to take care of yourself. Especially when you don't want to take care of yourself. On days where you're running late and you can't imagine taking more time out of your morning to have breakfast, or when you only have a half hour between classes and don't have time for lunch, your ED is going to latch onto that shit. You need to have a plan in place of how you are going to advocate for your health when your mind and everything around you is telling you you can't. Stash a box of granola bars in your car, throw a pb&j in your bag, whatever you need to do. Life is always going to be throwing challenges at you, and your ED will use whatever it can as a way to keep itself going. You need to learn how to put your health first.  Agreed!

i've always been a sensitive person, so something that has taken me a while to learn is the importance of protecting your energy.  a big part of that means being picky and choosing to only surround myself with people who respect my space and also serve my greatest gold. BUT, you don't always get to pick and choose every single person around you, and rather than just get angry at and take to heart everything that people from your coworkers to family who might have good intentions say, i think there is so much peace and value that can be found when you are able to listen to opposing points of views, think about why you disagree, *sometimes* share your thoughts, and walk away not feeling unworthy, but rather more confident in your beliefs.
——
it took me a long time to be able to treat noise as just noise, and even now, there are times it penetrates into my mind a little.  so, even when you don't always believe it, YOU ARE WORTHY, and your worth does not decrease based on somebody else's inability to see it

something that's important to realize and acknowledge is that all of those insecurities are rooted in fear...of not being loved or accepted. while i can't completely stop all my negative thoughts from creeping in, i can realize that listening to them is only self-destructive and that i have the choice to not let them control me.

Doc ID: 2361, distribution: 1.0 ; Reminder: you're not seeing the full reality online🪞⚠️

This morning I found another online scam using my “Real Me Monday” images as fake transformation photos with false outcomes for their own personal gain 💰

Instead of allowing these external pressures impact the way we view ourselves & push us further away from respecting our bodies, let's lean into showing ourselves love instead. 

I've been thinking about love languages recently & how my love language used to be primarily words of affirmation… Yet the way I ALWAYS spoke to myself was incredibly harsh. This got me thinking…

What's your love language?

I want to encourage you to do something for yourself that services the way you give & receive love. For e.g. if the way you feel love the most is through words of affirmation, but you constantly speak to yourself negatively, it's no wonder you feel terrible about yourself. That's destructive to your mindspace & confidence. Be mindful of your self-talk. You don't deserve all of the mean things you say to yourself.

If your love language is gifts, pick yourself some flowers or get your nails done 💐 if it's quality time, take yourself on a solo date or have a long, relaxing bath 🛁 if it's acts of service, romanticise your to-do list, put on some music, make your space clean & then sit back with a book & enjoy your fresh, cozy space. If it's physical touch… you know what to do 😉 OR perhaps you can do your skincare routine or book yourself a professional massage. These are just a few ways you can show yourself love 💗 

In the wise words of Miley Cyrus:
🎶 I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
& I can hold my own hand
I can love me better than you can 🎶 

Give yourself some of the love you always give to others 💗

Happy Real Me Monday 👑 p.s. my kinis are from @remmiebyriley (not an ad)

Growing up, I rarely thought twice about whether someone liked my outfit or heard me fart in the changing room (yes, I've done this and yes, people definitely heard 😅😂). I just lived my best life and to be honest with you, that's the way it should be! But I've also had my fair share of tears, tissues and time spent *wasted* (please let me emphasise) on caring too much about the judgement of others. They'll tell you you're ugly, you're ignorant, you have no life living at home. And wowwwww I've definitely fallen into the trap of believing all of it. Every. single. word!!! 😭
-
Now the sad reality is this: people's words and people's actions can be vile, cruel and completely unnecessary. And it's not easy to not care, I know all too well. But what you can start doing, from today, is making a conscious effort to stand your own ground. Focus on yourself. Love yourself, and remind yourself that what other people think does not define you. Embracing what you look like, who you are and how you choose to live your life every day is *the best* form of self care, like ever 🙌🏻

So cheers to showing all the critics, the jealous friends, the haters and maybe even that voice inside your very own head that we do not care what they think, and most importantly, that we're definitely not going to change because of it 🥂🤩

you deserve to experience the fun in making dumb spontaneous decisions.
you deserve to see the beauty in the simple things in life.
you deserve to make memories that you'll still be talking about  years from now.
you deserve to experience all the emotions, especially pure joy and happiness.
you deserve to live a life about FAR far more than the  food you eat, the movement you do, and what you look like.
you deserved to start living this life that i am describing many yesterdays ago.

it took me YEARS until i got real with myself, stopped making excuses, and finally chose to commit to a journey of food freedom and self-love, but why should YOU wait another day, week, month, or year to choose to live a full and vibrant life when you can choose to start living it right now?
——
the negative self-talk and instilled toxic beliefs are not your fault especially when we live in a society where damaging behaviors are normalized and idealized, BUT healing and learning to break free are your own responsibility.  if you needed a sign to do the hard inner work today, consider this it.  you only live once, so why not take this opportunity to choose to live the life you deserve?

Doc ID: 9774, distribution: 1.0 ; you can choose to accept yourself simply because of who you are, not because of what you look like, how hard you've worked, and all that you've done.

i still have moments when it's hard to feel “enough”, and i struggle to not “grade” my worth. in these moments, i remind myself of the commitment i've chosen to make to ACCEPT myself UNCONDITIONALLY aka no. matter. what.

practicing unconditional self-acceptance doesn't mean not having goals and forever being stagnant. what it does mean is not basing your worth on the achievements that may help your self-esteem, not beating yourself down for where you are currently at, and not needing certain conditions to be met to feel worthy.  while you can rate your actions, you can't rate something as complex as your 'self', and while you can fail at something, that doesn't make you are a failure.

if you've ever felt worthless, it's not your fault. we live in a culture that tells us our worth is dependent on what we achieve and the judgements of others. but, you deserve to feel at peace with yourself not just now, but always. some practices i like to include in my routine are:
- confronting my fears
- going outside and remembering my size
- sitting with myself and embracing my body
- forgiving myself and others
- celebrating wins
- being aware and staying neutral
- allowing myself to grieve the loss of my past and unrealized dreams
- doing acts of kindness
- taking care of myself mentally, physically, and emotionally
- speaking to your highest self

you are, have been, and will always be enough. you are worth it.

The course that will teach you how to be better?

The certification that will solve all your problems?

The program that will guide you to all your answers?

If you are… let's pause all the looking 👀OUTWARD and bring your attention ➡️inward⬅️

If there are any outstanding tasks, chores, items on your list that you've been holding off on, that's your work.

The things you've been avoiding out of fear or discomfort?

That's your work.

All those ⬆️ above totally can bring you to the next level

Sticking to an exercise program (that you probably already bought but never finished) can get you to a whole other level.

So if you've been reaching for things outside yourself to level up,

Maybe it's time to reach within. And work on your basics.

some moments, i feel good just doing and being me, love myself, and feel empowered doing shit on my own, and other moments, i feel sad, lonely, uneasy, and it's harder to embrace all of me.

there's less distraction from my thoughts and more opportunity for any anxious or negative thoughts to start spiraling. BUT, if there's ever a time to give yourself grace, accept yourself, and take care of yourself, it is NOW.

there's a lot going on, and all that you are feeling is valid, but now isn't the time to give up on your self-love and self-acceptance journey. keep being kind to yourself, and keep putting in the work because you are still worthy no. matter. what.

I have that now 😞 my abuser went missing and all these people were looking for them (they've now been found) and I just don't know how to feel. Am I a terrible person for hoping that they weren't found? It's just thrown me completely and I don't know how to cope really!  Answer: Oh anon what an awful situation. No you're not a terrible person. That sounds like an entirely normal and understandable feeling to hope they weren't found. No wonder it has stirred you up and made you feel incapable of functioning. My advice in the first instant would be just to survive. Distract, soothe, do whatever you can to safely allow some time to pass. Feelings can feel like a pack of cards all thrown up into the air, and with a bit of time, they land on the ground and it's easier to pick through them and see what's standing out. Sometimes the feeling of not being able to function settles down as your adrenaline levels come back down.I hope you have someone(s) in real life who you can talk to and process this with because it sounds like it's stirred a lot up for you and you deserve some help and support in working through all that. It's very valid to feel stirred up and panicky in this situation so please be gentle with yourself and everything you're feeling. You have survived this so far and I know you will make it through this. Take care xx

It is hard when you think that there is no one who listens, no one who cares, no one who wants to walk the path with you. It is hard when you think you are the only one who feels this way, the only one who is hurting, the only one who has to go through this. You might feel lonely, but you are not alone. We all feel this way from time to time, which is why it is important to share your thoughts and emotions. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your partner, tell your pet, tell strangers on the internet, just tell anyone. Because people care, they can relate and they will be there.

despite being an only child, i've never been alone to the extent i am in my new apartment. my parents were always very present in my life when i lived with them, and when i went to college, there were people to hang out with or talk to anytime, anywhere.

something i'm still learning to fully understand is the fact that being alone can be a really wonderful thing, and being alone doesn't automatically mean you have to feel lonely. having people physically around me brings me a lot of comfort and energy, but i know that being alone can be a comfortable and enjoyable thing too. i have a lot of time this week to sit around, adjust, and reflect, but one of the things i already know i want to do during this chapter of my life is continue to foster my relationship with myself and bring it to new levels so that i can continue to live life aiming to be the most me ME i can be.

happy monday ✨ you are a beautiful and incredible human being. in the midst of all the goal setting, achievement seeking, and “doing” of life, i hope you remember to embrace all that you already have and allow yourself to ~be~ today too.

I was really using my platform and background to my advantage.

I was achieving the things I wanted to achieve … but i started to feel stuck in my situation. 

I felt the pull to go in a different direction, but i felt stuck on the path i had gone so far down.

My all-or-nothing mindset kept me so stuck that my skin absorbed my stress and lashed out in rashes.

It kept me so stuck that my drive to “push on” got my hormones got out of balance.

Feeling stuck is one of the main reasons my clients feel frustrated with their inaction and confusion. 

Feeling stuck is also a FEELING. It's never a fact that you are stuck in life- sometimes you just need to see life from a different angle! 

As i dug deeper into my inner work, i felt less stuck & was catapulted into a series of events that turned Amanda, the burnt out pre-med student, into Amanda, the thriving guide, mentor & coach.

If you resonate with my story at all,  ask yourself these questions:

️⃣- what kind of person do you want to be?

️⃣- what do you actually want/ value the most for your life?

️⃣- what does the life you want to live FEEL like?

& as you journal… get really clear on what you want/how you want your life to feel.

questions like this bring up deep desires within you which act as breadcrumbs to your purpose.

Next time you sit down to “manifest,” consider this:

✨what does living a life you're excited about FEEL like?

✨what does being proud of what you do everyday and how you serve others FEEL like?

✨what does being connected to your purpose, passion, & gifts FEEL like?

✨what does certainty in who you are and what you do FEEL like?

➡️Those FEELINGS are what you need to sit in when you're doing your visualizations/manifestations/affirmations. 

Words are just the vessel to the energy you bring.

So when you're doing this, let go of the Realist within you. 

❌”that's not actually true for me right now”
❌”i'm not in abundance right now”
❌”I can't do that”

I remember going to college and thinking “these next  years are going to be the time when I find myself”. Well, turns out, 'myself' is right here and has been right here this entire time. And, rather than 'finding' myself, I had to remember, return, and reclaim myself.
——
In this lifetime, I will probably lose myself a few more times, whether that's losing myself in work, losing myself to an illness, losing a part of myself when I lose someone else, or losing myself to the pressures of society. But, when that happens, it's important to remember that we are not trapped in where we are, and your current life is not permanent.  We are in control of our own lives, and we are allowed to lose ourselves, rediscover ourselves, take a few steps forward, and then, do it all over again because that is how we grow and expand.
——
It is okay to feel stuck sometimes, and it's okay if you still feel it, and still feel it, and still feel it. Feeling things deeply is hard and sometimes lasts longer than we'd like. Rather than beating yourself up though and making things worse, allow yourself to  take the time you need and love yourself because you will get there eventually 💖

 I sat in the parking garage outside of the treatment center and cried for an hour when I ate my first meal in a month.

I don't think I can do this.

I hugged my knees to my chest, took a few deep breaths, and wiped away a layer of tears with my sleeve.

It had taken everything inside of me just to drive there that morning and this felt like more than I could handle. I still wasn't even sure that I wanted recovery in the first place - what was I doing at a treatment center again? Why had I reached out for help? 

Recovery had come to symbolize everything that I was most afraid of: it meant becoming solid, giving up being a ghost-girl. I wasn't sure if I was ready to trade haunting lightness for presence and weight and substance.

I stared at the building in front of me through tear-blurred vision and wondered what part of me thought that going back to treatment was a good idea.

                                                    // Relapse is not what I had in mind when I left my last treatment center. I signed recovery contracts, set up aftercare appointments, taped motivational quotes around my apartment and prepared menus each week according to my dietitian-approved mealplan. But it was always lingering there, the desire to be sick. It didn't take long. It was surprisingly simple actually, deciding to dance with the devil again. I let myself be pulled back to the Land of Shadows, to the familiar, terrifying terrain of self-denial and frail non-existence.  When my body survived off of caffeine and adrenaline, I felt invincible. Look at how powerful I am, I would say, stepping on the scale to find that the number has gone down again. I am so powerful that I can make myself disappear. I would suppress my hunger with gum and coffee, and reward myself at the end of each day with a small, obsessively measured allotment of calories. 

My body was in agony, but as I entered a foggy haze of starvation again, the Real Pain, the one that never let up, began to thin out. It seemed to shrink in proportion to my shrinking body. This is what you wanted, I would remind myself, when my stomach growled too loudly and the jar of peanut butter in the cabinet was the only thing I could focus on. You want to be numb to the pain.  And I was right. It was what I had wanted. But there was always a pause after those words. A moment.

A breath. A hesitation.  week in the light. 

I had survived another day of treatment, showing up even when I didn't feel like it. I did not want to eat.  At every meal I was faced with a plate full of food and a mind that was resisting. 

Emptiness had been a welcome relief. Starvation had felt preferable to the pain of being.

While I might have gone back to treatment, I still didn't know how to stop wanting The Monster.

today, in the shadows

I cannot tell you for certain if the real Me, with a capital M, still exists somewhere in this ghost-shell of a body. 

Most days I cannot hear anything in my head except The Monster. 

Are you even in there? I whisper to her in the darkness, huddled under layers of blankets in my bed. Have you managed to survive the war?  And from some deep, buried corner of my soul, I think I feel her stirring.

Me with a Capital M doesn't respond. If she were to speak, I don't know that I would even be able to distinguish her voice from The Monster. But it is something, knowing that she is still in there after all of this time.                                                //  When I eat, the Monster begins to roar in my head, telling me that there is a deep dirtiness swimming in my veins. It rages and screams that the only way that I can atone for the crime of existing is to starve / purge / bleed these tainted parts out of me. But I am beginning to feel her in bits in pieces now, Capital M Me, and she is pushing for something else. And I begin to wonder: what would happen if the gods did not get their sacrifice this time? What if I were to stop punishing myself endlessly to satiate their bloodthirsty appetites? What if She were allowed to stand and speak more often instead of The Monster?  Would the foundations of the earth shatter? Would the planets collide?
And I am so afraid –

 Not of planets colliding or earth-shattering disruptions,I am afraid of life and happiness and freedom. I am afraid of change. I am afraid of losing the ghost-girl that I hide beneath and beginning to fill in with Me. I am afraid of losing my power - and of gaining it. I am afraid of the anger of the gods when I stop offering up my body as a sacrifice. I am afraid of healing when it feels so very much like the last thing I deserve. I am caught now between wanting to listen to Me, with a Capital M, whose words feel more authentic and true and resonate in my bones, and giving in to The Monster, whose abusive voice is set on replay. This is the unholy tension in which I live, and for which I do not yet have an answer. 

But: there is a weak sliver of light shining in, barely enough to see in front of me, that is keeping the shadows from swallowing me whole. In the light there is a glimmer of maybe and what if that will keep me getting up in the morning, showing up to treatment, facing that plate of food again and again, and listening for when Capital M Me begins to speak at last.

The truth is, I don't know how I'm going to get through each meal everyday. It gets overwhelming if I think about it for too long. But for whatever reason, that Space In Between, that sacred hesitation after “I want to be numb,” is holding me back from falling headlong into the darkness.

Habits that helped me gradually recover from Major Depression: Baby Steps Edition Disclaimer: Implementing these changes into your life does not mean instant or guaranteed recovery, but they can aid in therapy and are generally a good place to start when you want to get out but are so deep in the rabbit hole that you don't know how. For me, they made the general act of living and staying alive so much more bearable, over several years, I might add. - Purge your social media! This can be a gradual process. Every time you come upon a picture that depicts self harm, a sad quote, anything that makes being sick into a desireable aesthetic, unfollow the blog that posted it. When depressed, social media is one of the things that requiere the least energy to do, so it's important you only follow blogs that lift you up. For me that's pretty food pictures, cats, renaissance art and mediterranean aesthetic. - Stop consuming violent media. This ties in to the step above, but sometimes I'd find that watching shows with a lot of fights, violence, drugs and blood also put me in a bad mindset. If you must binge watch to cope, like I did, watch childrens cartoons, or wholesome comedy series like The Office or Brooklyn Nine Nine. The things we look at online have a lot of effect on our thoughts.This also means no gore and no violent or degrading porn. - Never say no to a social event. Always chose to be around others, if possible. Following this rule has made me much more outgoing, less anxious, and made me spend less time on my own, alone with my thoughts. This obviously doesn't mean go to parties every weekend, even though you hate them, or drag yourself out of bed even when you're sick! - Stop engaging in destructive relationships. I slowly stopped hanging out with all my friends who did drugs, self harmed and were depressed and reconnected with old friends I had lost contact with while I was very sick. It is hard to recover when you're constantly around mentally ill people, who also don't handle life well. I'm not saying drop all your friends, I'm saying be around people you can use as an example, who are neurotypical, who can bring you back to reality and show you how “normal people” manage things. - Clean living space! For about a year, I lived in a dark room. Why was it dark, you might ask? Because I absolutely could not stand the mess, I didn't wanna see it, I couldn't clean it either, so I only ever went into my room with the lights turned off. It made such a difference when I finally cleaned it in a rare moment of motivation. I suggest first tidying up your bed, then the floor, then gradually all surfaces and lastly cupboards and the wardrobe etc. Just having a free floor makes all the difference sometimes. I'd suggest watching room makeovers on Youtube or Marie Kondos Tidying Up for motivation. I might add, change doesn't happen over night. It took me roughly four years to get from laying in my dark room in my bed all day, surrounded by my own filth and skipping school more often than not, to being content almost every day, not wanting to cry upon waking up and only ever so often having a bad day. I am still mentally ill and probably always will be, but I am so glad I made those changes all those years ago, and slowly, but surely the pain I felt every day got a bit less and less. If you have any questions, feel free to DM or ask me.

*drumroll because its such a mystery and you've never heard this one before in your life😜*

myself.

𝑰 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒅 𝒎𝒚𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒇 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌

because 𝑰 was scared to make the “wrong” choice

𝑰 was nervous about what people would think about me

𝑰 didn't want to let my parents down

𝑰 didn't want the time i spent in school/training/internship to go to waste

𝑰 wanted to make sure i was on the CORRECT path

but what 𝑰 really needed was to build trust in myself, my decisions, and my ability to catch myself when i fell.

𝑰 needed support, clarity, and guidance from my own inner compass.

once i realized i was the missing piece in all of these, it all clicked.

If you have the feeling that something needs to change, you know deep down that taking a leap will make even a short life worth living. 

So this is the time to get really honest about where you are, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 to be very compassionate with yourself, as this is not an easy spot to be in.

Until the moment felt it

And if you don't get it, I will try my hardest to explain. 

But those of you could get it… You understood as soon as I said that. 

I was so confident in the current path that I was on. I was getting clinical experience as an RD, preparing for the MCAT, sprucing up my application to medical school so i could reach my goal as a preventative family physician.

I told everybody I knew that “I don't see myself ever changing my mind about this.”

And then one day, I DID exactly that. 

Some thing else called for me.

As much as I tried to resist it, I knew that if I continued on the path that was no longer for me… id live a life in misery. 

I had to make my choice. 

I compare this unexplainable feeling of change to the feeling a mother who just gave birth to her first baby (might) get. It's hard to describe but you just KNOW a shift has happened. 

it's strong, and it's real, and it's life-changing. 

If this is resonating with you, you know deep down that taking a leap will make even a short life worth living.

i'm not even close to what ~society~ views as “perfect”, but i no longer strive to be.  something that took me a long time to understand, only after a lot of resistance and trial and error, is that once you step into your own magic ✨ and who you really are and finally let go of what you can't control, the world WILL start to open up for you.  whether you see it or not, there is so much light and abundance out there, and there is a bigger picture waiting to reveal itself to you

Your process IS your progress.

Whatever you work on for yourself today is ultimately part of that big goal, that dream life, that big vision.

You really have all the things you need to get started today.

We look for so much external validation to tell us that we're going in the right direction,

To tell us that we've “progressed,”

When we ALSO can internally validate ourselves.

You don't have  to wait until you land that dream job that checks every box for you, feels fulfilling, and that also makes you enough money to live life comfortably and go on  vacations a year.

(this is possible for you BTW)

Did you go on that walk today? Did you speak kindly to yourself today? Did you make the effort to go to bed earlier today?

You make your own measures, your own goals. 

once you stop striving for “progress” and start enjoying the focus on your “process,”

You'll see your life flourish.

You got this. I love you.

Doc ID: 9603, distribution: 0.41339685230254875 ; reminders to stop comparing yourself to others and caring so much about what others think!

YOU WILL NEVER BE FOR EVERYONE- some people like their coffee black, some like it with cream, some like it iced, some like it hot, and some people don't like it at all. you might not be for everyone, but you can  always work on accepting yourself.

YOU DON'T SEE THE FULL PICTURE- you don't know what internal struggles other people are going through. you don't see what people are or aren't doing outside of the moments you see. on social media and in real life, you never see the full reality of other people's lives, but you see all of your own.

WISH OTHER PEOPLE THE BEST- you might not see what other people are dealing with behind the scenes, but you can still wish them happiness. if someone is celebrating an accomplishment, you can wish them happiness without beating yourself up for not accomplishing the same. if someone is showing their healthy lifestyle changes, you can wish them health and happiness without feeling like you need to make the same changes they are. “you can admire someone else's garden while still watering and admiring your own”.

PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND HOW YOU FEEL- do you find yourself comparing and feeling pressured when you're on social media? set boundaries with it and take breaks. do certain accounts make you feel worse about yourself? protect yourself, and mute, unfollow, or block accounts that aren't serving you (you can always undo this). do certain people make you feel appreciated and comfortable being your authentic self? spend more time with them.

BUILD YOURSELF UP SO YOU DON'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU- other people's opinions of you, positive or negative, are none of your business. be kind to yourself, spend time with yourself, learn to accept yourself, and treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend because at the end of the day, you're what you've got, so YOUR opinion of you matters way more than other's.

there's other people's expectations and society's standards, but we get to make the rules for our own lives! i say we live it!!! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24422, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: How do you avoid relapse? Answer: you just keep trying. sometimes itll happen because progress isnt a straight line to recovery. progress looks more like a serpentine. youre gonna deviate from the linear path but that doesnt mean that u arent still moving forward. relapse feels horrible, that i do know. physically and emotionally - it feels fucking terrible especially when you're trying to get better. if you slip up, just take that feeling - that physical and emotional turmoil - and REMEMBER it for the next time you feel weak. it might help you to hold yourself together if you're feeling a relapse but you remind yourself of how much WORSE youll feel if you give in. giving in isnt the end of the world, willpower is an acquired skill. it takes a long long time to recover but if you dont give up for years, one day food wont control you anymore and once food doesnt control you - you can get your life back on track and do incredible things uninhibited by the thought of a relapse. best of luck to you!

addendum: change your surroundings! if youre currently around people or places that make recovery difficult, do everything in your power to remove those people and places - or at least distance yourself from them mentally and physically the best that you can. if i were still  and spending half my days in my moms basement - id probably still be purging AND doing like heroin by now lol. if the toxic people in your life are your parents the situation gets a little trickier and you have to be five to ten times as strong as someone with supportive parents.

these fears can be SOOOO debilitating and can stop you from actually going for what you want, and BEING who you want to be.

when i peeled back the layers of each fear-based belief, i realized that they all stemmed from a common-thread belief that honestly sounded so illogical.

when i realized what it was and did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

❌“my parents are going to be so disappointed in me”

became➡️

✅“my parents love me unconditionally, and their reaction to my passion/path is not my responsibility. my decision to choose what i want over what they want is independent of my love and respect for them.”

❌“its too late to change my path, there's not enough time”

became➡️ 

✅“i don't operate on any one timeline. i can create what i want whenever i want. this is the game of life.”

❌“i might make the wrong choice and regret it”

became➡️ 

✅ “every choice i make leads me to a more compassionate & aware version of myself. the more i practice making choices, the better i get at discerning which will be best for me.”

❌“im not skilled/smart/capable enough to do it.”

became➡️ 

✅”I can do anything i set my mind to. what matters more than my SKILL is how much i ENJOY the process.”

❌“i will lose friends and connections in my community

became➡️ 

✅”i do not need to be understood. I have value to share. my ideal community is full of people who want to hear my message.”

⁠
While having their approval and encouragement in your big dream and venture helps, the truth is that not everyone will be happy for you. Not everyone will understand why you chose to veer off into a different calling even if it makes sense and feels good to you. 

Looking for the approval or acceptance of others is NATURAL, but may also stop you from spreading your wings.
⁠
Here are the people you need to focus on instead: ⇣⁠
✨ the  year old version of you ⁠
✨ the  year old version of you
✨ people who are curious about the things you are but don't have/see any representation of that in the media or in their lives
✨ people who your message will inspire and change
⁠
When we flip the script and think about EVERYONE that will receive you, then you can also see the people who NEED your message more than anything else. 

It's true. People will judge you. They might talk about you. They might give you unsolicited advice. 

But there are also people who will be inspired by you. They will think of you when they are drawing up courage to do something. They will keep you in the back of their mind for inner strength, courage & wisdom.

Who would you rather speak to?

- making sure everyone is happy with your life shifts

- not wanting to make a wrong choice… so you don't make any at all and perpetuate feeling stuck

- thinking that your sensitivity and empathy is a WEAKNESS, so you hide it and don't explore what it can actually do for you.

- forcing a path because it “seems” right, not because you truly FEEL in your body that it is the right move.

I always try to start again but somehow I keep throwing up or something and I constantly feel like crap and feel sick and cold and tired and I almost feel like giving up 😭 Answer: This is tumblr we are all depressing, no shameEds are a constant struggle. And recovery is in no way easy. Its a choice that is made every day, will you or will you not fight the ed. Bumps in the road happen. I have never seen or met anyone with a perfect recovery. Ever. That shit is BUMPY and fuck ups happen, its part of the process. What matters is getting back on your feet and assessing what happened. Why did that bump appear in the road? Why did i tumblr down it so hard? What can i do next to time avoid the bump or to minimize the damage? What tools will i use to help myself through it the next time it happens? What can i learn from this and how can i prepare for it later? Recovery is constantly changing and adapting to what works for you personally. If youre the exact same as when you first started recovery, something isnt right. And giving up seems so easy, when changing seems so hard. Bro. Sis. Whoever you are, anon. Giving up just aint worth it. Always seek out help from others. Be willing to put in the work to find what works for you. Keep fighting.We are all gonna die. Might as well live a life giving maximum effort, instead of literally doing nothing to help ourselves.

finding what feels best for me during this chapter. asking myself how i can live my fullest life, and then making it my goal to do just that. aiming for feelings of peace, stability, strength, acceptance, and freedom. pursuing spontaneous plans and eats, yeses, and memories. more more more.

at times it's uncomfortable to move away from the familiar and into the unknown. from old clothes and into new ones. from a position of control and into one of receiving. 

it's hard but not impossible. it's hard but worth it. it's hard but it's also incredible, discovering and meeting this new version of myself. 

here are the healing phrases that ground me in moments of anxiety. when i begin to question whether or not to keep pushing, i speak these words to myself, to my body:

- ⚡️thank you
- ⚡️i'm on your side
- ⚡️i appreciate you
- ⚡️i respect you
- ⚡️i care for you
- ⚡️all discomfort is temporary
- ⚡️you are capable 
- ⚡️you are strong
- ⚡️food is my friend
- ⚡️movement is my friend
- ⚡️rest is my friend

the life i lead in my body is much more valuable than the appearance of my body itself. i'm grateful for what this body allows me to do. for the experiences i live through this shape.

You are not ugly. You are not worthless. You are not a waste of space. This is not the end of the world. There are so many exciting and beautiful things ahead of you, my love. Look how far you have already come. No matter how hard it has been, you are still here, surviving and I am so damn proud of you. You can absolutely do this. You are capable. I believe in you.

if you want to add more to your “unstoppable” toolkit,

add some purpose into the mix.

even with the holidays being bright and jolly, loving friends and family around, and my wedding to the love of my life coming up, it's been kinda rough

im in my luteal phase (ladies you know what it's like), things have been slow on the business side, & some friendships have been coming to a close

i wanted to throw in the towel and disappear quite a few times already this month. just being real.

but… i remembered my WHY. that this life that i'm living is bigger than me. 

and that i owe it to you, and i owe it to myself, to keep moving forward with love

i've learned and am always practicing how to hold and feel my emotions and still say “yes, i feel it all AND i am here to bring my community more light.”

i've had minimal motivation in the kitchen...and most other things in life lately, and you know what? that's okay.

this season of life is hard. i sit in an uncomfortable high chair at my kitchen island  hours a day trying my best to do work. i hardly leave my apartment ever. i feel like i'm repeating the same days over and over. i don't interact with many people. i simultaneously have a lot to do and nothing to do. i keep pushing things off. i'm exhausted.

there's a lot for me to be grateful for, and i'm so proud of myself for everything i've been through, but sometimes life just feels hard, and that's OKAY too. we are allowed to feel real human emotions because we are human beings just doing our freaking best to make it in this crazy world.

productivity may look different these days, but that doesn't make any of us any less worthy or capable.

some affirmations for me (and maybe for you too):

i embrace myself and all the things that make me who i am.

i am on my own path. there is no being behind when the only person on this path is me.

i have enough, and i am enough.

i do not seek perfection. my mistakes are signs of growth and exploration.

i have time to become all that i am meant to be.

i am capable of doing hard things.

i am so rooted in who i am that no one and nothing can disturb my peace.

——
*disclaimer: some opinions are helpful when they're from people you trust to tell you if you're going crazy, to push you if you need encouragement, and to keep you in check*
——
i know it's easier said than done to stop thinking about what you think you *should* be doing and start prioritizing what you want to be doing, so here are some practical things to remember:
✨you will never be everyone's cup of tea, so stop trying. being your own is what matters most.
✨when people have negative comments or even judgments to make, it's usually a reflection of them and not actually about you.  from what i've learned, the people who are negative about someone else who didn't do anything directly to them are usually struggling with or are insecure about something themselves.
✨what's the worst case scenario? that someone *may* say something about you? is that really bad enough to hold you back from living a life that fulfills you and makes you happier?
✨you only live once. i don't mean to be morbid, but we're all going to die eventually. in , , or  years from now, i hope you get to look back on your life without regrets and knowing that you chose to be true to yourself and happy.
——
and lastly, if you catch yourself judging or making comments about others, please stop. let's all try to focus on becoming the best versions of ourselves and lift other people up for doing the same, even if it's a different way than us

——
i know that i'm not everyone's cup of tea, but to be honest, i don't really care anymore. i don't always love all of me, but i choose to accept and embrace myself every day. i give myself kindness ALWAYS because at the end of the day, the one person who will be there for me no matter what, is ME, and if I get to CHOOSE whether i want to be my best friend or my enemy, i'm going to choose to be my best friend because I'm the moments that i fail, get really down, or notice something i don't like about myself (it happens to the best of us), i'd much rather have the voice in my head tell me words of kindness and understanding rather than judgement and criticism.

here's your monday reminder to BE KIND to yourself.  what YOU think of you is more important than what ANYONE else thinks of you.  being mean to yourself has never done any good, so why not try being nice to yourself and see how that goes? 💗

Doc ID: 16664, distribution: 0.6640861279543495 ; My therapist mistimed the end of my session a bit this week. I had been talking about my childhood and I was way back in the past, feeling quite young and sad and sorry for myself. I was totally not thinking about the time or how much session was left. I stopped talking and paused for a moment, and T jumped in and said “Before we finish for the day, how has it felt talking about these things today?” My mind was still  years ago and it was really jarring to suddenly be asked a present day question. I couldn't even switch my brain quick enough to answer. Looking back, I still don't know why T decided to jump in with her question so abruptly like that. I was already looking down but I hid my face and said “You went too fast then” T checked herself and said some soothing things. I carried on hiding my face and wrestling with getting myself back to the present and the part of me still in the past welled up with tears. “Are you tearful?” T asked gently. I nodded. She continued, “Yeah…. is it because of the past or is it because I went too fast?” I said “The past”. T said some other things which I can't remember. Then she asked me about a local event as a bit of a grounding exercise right at the end. We went about  minutes over but I'm glad we had the extra time for me to get back into a present state of mind.

Doc ID: 15206, distribution: 0.45885867174021466 ; Therapy was really difficult this morning. The internet connection wasn't good and we kept freezing up. It hasn't been as bad as this for ages. We tried ending the call and calling back a couple of times but in the end we just went with it. We talked a bit about my holiday, mostly it felt like chatting but it was important for reconnecting after the break. T was very pleased to hear I'd done the zipwire with the children, and she said she's been to the Eden Project and she would have done the zipwire too but she didn't have anyone to do it with because her husband wasn't keen.  I talked about how freaked out I was when we got to the zipwire place and the lady asked us to “hop on the weighing scales”. That led to a conversation about weight but the internet connection got really bad and I didn't want to jump into deeper thoughts wrestling with what to do about weighing myself. T was understanding and said “do you want to stick to a safer topic with this bad connection?”  It was hard to talk because I usually avoid a lot of eye contact when I'm talking about hard things, but today I had to keep glancing because I needed to see if the screen had frozen. It's kind of grounding because I have to stay in the present with all the stop-starting of the conversation, but actually I need to not be grounded all the time so I can lose myself in what I'm talking about.

Doc ID: 14419, distribution: 0.4213854441700518 ; Question: (I'm the anon with the therapist who keeps changing days) she also keeps saying things like 'if you want to continue meeting' and 'would you like the Monday time?' Like she isn't the one who has decided to make this change. I'm finding it rather hurtful and considering running away and ghosting her but a little part of me thinks I might regret that. I know the best idea would be to talk to her about this but I don't know how to do that  Answer: I think it's a therapist thing to help clients feel that it's their choice to be there each week and not assume. Maybe your therapist doesn't want to assume that you'll be ok with the Monday time, so she's trying to leave it open for you to say yes or no. Have you been able to give her any idea that you're not happy with changing days? I think I might say something like “it feels really hard to change days” and that might open up the conversation about how it feels and why and would give my therapist a chance to empathise and let me know that she appreciates it's difficult for me.

Doc ID: 15427, distribution: 0.20176064020125886 ; Teletherapy  At the end of therapy yesterday, we were talking about doing therapy online and how it has worked really well for us. T said when she first moved away and we changed from face to face therapy to doing it over Skype, she had a supervisor in her new location who told her that she really needed to work towards terminating with me and getting me to start back seeing someone face to face. Of course T didn't tell me that at the time, but she said she herself felt very resistant to that idea and she felt that we were doing really good work together over Skype. So in our conversation in session yesterday, T was reflecting on how now most therapy has gone online, many therapists and clients are discovering there are actually benefits to it. T said some clients are reporting that they find even sessions over the phone helpful because there is yet another extra layer of distance so they can be more open.  I think that maybe it has been implied to her in supervision and peer supervision that therapy by Skype can not possibly be as good as face to face, and now that all these therapists are having to do therapy by Skype too, they're realising it doesn't have to be a second-best method. For some clients (maybe mostly the avoidant ones like me, ha!), that extra bit of distance helps them say things that would feel too overwhelming or difficult to say actually in person.

Doc ID: 15180, distribution: 1.0 ; I haven't had time to stop and process (journal) Tuesday's therapy session yet. All that keeps going round in my head is the end of the session, when I shut down and T asked “Are you angry with me?” and I told her I was. Then she said that we were right at the end of the session, and did I want to wind down for five minutes or just leave it there? I was feeling so mad and I didn't want to engage any more, but I knew if I left the session in this state I would probably feel worse over this coming week than if we at least did a bit of grounding now, so I reluctantly agreed to keep going. There was a lot of internal resistance and I really didn't want to talk to T about the surface-level things she started trying to make conversation with me over. For the last few minutes, I let her do most of the talking till time was up. She tried to get in some supportive stuff and building up “I'm on your side” kind of things. Then we said goodbye. I was still mad but at least we had a bit of wrapping-up to contain the mad until next session.

Doc ID: 16512, distribution: 1.0 ; Therapy .. // ending session  Ever since that one session where T tried to bring the session to a close quite abruptly and it made me suddenly all tearful and I told her she went too fast, she has been very careful to make sure to bring me back to the present at the end.  Towards the end this week, she said “Ok Faith, I'm just letting you know I'm going to bring this to an end soon. I want us to have some time to bring you back and help you get a bit grounded before we end.” We came to an end of what we were talking about, and T tried to bring things back to the surface. She said “So tell me about [something].” I can't even remember what she asked me about. I can remember sitting there listening to her but feeling miles away, nodding vaguely but not quite being able to get myself to speak. It's like being stuck between staying in the far away or putting in the effort to haul myself back into the present. T carried on talking and eventually I managed to get myself to answer. Once I got started talking, it was easier to keep going and get back into the present and regular conversation. T always ends the session with scheduling for the next week. Even when it's just agreeing the usual time and day, it's a good cue for me that we are about to say goodbye. I'm sad we only have one more session now before the two week Christmas break.

Doc ID: 14933, distribution: 0.5736043962827636 ; Question: Hi Faith, I've been following your blog for a long time now and was hoping for some advice from you or your followers. I know about how your therapy journey started but do you have any advice for anyone starting therapy? After years & years of wondering, I'm now starting therapy next week. I don't have an ED and I kind of feel like I don't "need" therapy but I also don't really know how to feel happy & can't remember the last time I did. But I don't know whether a therapist could help with that. Answer: Ah I think a therapist could definitely help with that! Well done you for being brave and taking the plunge to work on something that you want to be different in your life. I would have also said I didn't “need” therapy when I started. Because I was keeping myself alive day to day and wasn't that what really counted? But you don't need to be on the verge of insanity before you can go to therapy. Wanting to improve your life in any way related to your mental wellbeing is a good enough reason to go to therapy.I am never sure how helpful it is to give advice about starting therapy, because I think every therapist is slightly different and going in with too much advice given beforehand means you already have expectations about how it should go. I don't know what sort of person you are, whether you find it easy to speak about how you're feeling or not. I also have a whole load of words now to describe my inner world that I didn't have any concept for when I started therapy, so I could suggest from my 'enlightened position' that you say this or that, and you might look at me like I'm talking a foreign language. I think just turn up and try and be as straight up as you can. Tell the therapist why you've come for therapy, and let them take it from there. For me, because I'm quite avoidant and reticent in therapy, sometimes I try and pretend that I'm someone who doesn't mind talking about these things, who doesn't get tied in knots over it. Because I truly believe there are people out there who are like that. So I try and pretend I'm one of them and that can help me just get on and say stuff without overthinking it to the nth degree. A bit like, Fake it till you Make it, although I'm not encouraging you to be fake in therapy, it's just brain tricks I try and use to help myself talk! Best wishes for your first therapy session, I hope it goes well and you click with your therapist. (Remember you can shop around for a different therapist if you find after a few sessions that they're not the one for you) xx

T answered me straight away with a very firm “no”. She said that me and her daughter are very separate in her mind and she is not getting us mixed up. So I feel reassured that whatever was going on two sessions ago was not that. And I feel reassured in general that her daughter's situation is completely separate to me.

When we started the session, she said her head was a bit all over the place and she said would I remind her if she didn't quite remember everything and she apologised in advance if she forgot something.  I didn't ask what was going on. She said she had to go away unexpectedly later today. I'm guessing a family member taken ill? So now I'm hyper aware that I shouldn't bother her because she'll be busy dealing with her own stuff, and of course exactly because I'm thinking that, the child part of me is feeling abandoned and sad over not being able to contact T. Even though I have nothing to contact her about right now! But what if I did? Hmm then what??

Doc ID: 12113, distribution: 0.07126338900311566 ; mirithebrave:  Also - screw it - while we're talking about treatment experiences, here's my review of Renfrew (the Brentwood, TN location). Prepare yourselves, it's bad. This was the absolute worst treatment experience I've had (and that's saying A LOT).  A big part of my trauma is religious (I grew up in an end-of-the-world cult organization), and I asked from day one to not be put with a therapist who is openly religious because my system will code them as unsafe. The intake person said that would definitely be taken care of and that they were the most trauma-informed center she'd ever worked for. Y'ALL.  On day one, I find out that the therapist I've been placed with does Christian counseling in her outpatient practice and my system immediately went into self-protective mode. I'm sure she was great therapist and very skilled at her job, but because of my religious PTSD, my brain coded her as unsafe and I was unable to talk to her or open up.  I told them I couldn't work with her - I tried to advocate for myself because I know my brain. The psychiatric provider told me I needed to learn to work through that and that that was the actual issue, that I needed to learn to work with Christian therapists. SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT after I had just said that I grew up in a Christian cult and have PTSD from that. My issue was not the harm they caused, but being unable to work with Christian therapists… Well about  weeks into my stay, I have a breakdown because I've been off my antidepressants for weeks and no one has been monitoring my meds. I asked - no, BEGGED, to talk to someone because I was feeling desperate. The therapist on site told me that “maybe now just isn't the best time for treatment” and maybe I needed to hit rock bottom first. I walked away feeling even more desperate.  The entire time when I was struggling with trauma symptoms (dissociating a lot, having panic attacks) I was told that I was being avoidant and resistant and just wasn't motivated enough, even though I was giving it all I had.  A friend of mine, another patient, was literally sent to a room by herself when she couldn't finish a meal, even though that replicated traumatic punishments she had as a child (she told me all of this and I told her if they made her do it again I would come sit with her so she wouldn't be alone).  They don't teach coping skills either? Everything is labeled avoidance (music, writing, any “healthy” coping skills is avoidance unless you just sit and feel the emotion). That may sound innocent enough until you bring trauma into the equation, in which just “sitting with” the traumatic emotions / thoughts is not how you heal and in fact may be re-traumatizing.  I was also constantly made to feel like I was the problem. The approach was extremely punitive. One of the head dietitians, who was not on my team, threatened on my second to last day that if I didn't finish a meal, they might discharge me early. I told her I was about to discharge in two days, and she said, “Well, we might make it tomorrow instead.” I was already anxious enough, and I don't respond well to ultimatums or threats (who does?), which were really common there. All of that to say: they are NOT equipped to treat trauma, no matter what they advertise.  EDITED to add: I've written reviews on Yelp and Google, if you want to “like” them ;)  
 I found my old treatment plans from Renfrew: “client presents with an avoidance of vulnerable emotions; is quick to anger to feel a sense of power”   okay. I have PTSD; avoidance is LITERALLY one of the diagnostic criteria for that. As for anger, I wasn't being heard & was shamed at every turn for trauma responses. My anger was self-protection & survival. Any clinician worth their salt would approach that with compassion. oh, but this next part: “Client endorses trauma response to one staff member she has “coded” as unsafe.”  Yeah, see my brain did not *choose* to code this staff membee as unsafe. She was connected to things associated with my trauma. That was mocked. Anyway, fuck Renfrew.

She asked me how I would have felt if we'd had this conversation a year ago. I think that must be one of her stupidest questions ever! How do I know how I would have felt a year ago? I threw my hands up at her and said “How can I answer that??” Then T said that she couldn't put words into my mouth and she had to let me come to my own conclusions. “I didn't want to damage your family relationships by pushing you into thinking about things before you were ready. And I had to be careful not to put words in your mouth, and to let you come to your own conclusions. I feel like she has been too cautious. I have felt that she doesn't think anything very bad happened because she hasn't picked up on any of the little things I mentioned, so I've concluded she can't think they're really that bad and I think I've felt shame that even though they weren't really that bad I wasn't able to cope with them better, and that has made it harder to fully talk about them which has kept me stuck in just dropping little mentions here and there and generally downplaying them. I suppose a lifetime habit of keeping myself emotionally safe by microanalysing other people's reactions and adjusting my own words and actions accordingly doesn't disappear easily.

I have stuff written down…. it's just hard to start talking about it.” “Is it one topic or more than one?” We chat a bit about why I wouldn't want to talk about it. I tell T that maybe I don't want to because it's *effort*. That makes her smIle, “Hasn't the whole of therapy been effort?” Then I tell her all my usual things, that I can't decide where to start, that I can't work out how to get it all said in a nice order. This is nothing new. T reminds me to just start by pulling a thread out and we will follow that thread and see where it goes. Eventually I get going. “Uh so you know that screenshot I sent you? from the Why Love Matters book? So I've had that book for ages on my kindle, but I decided I'd buy an actual paper copy of it. I ordered it on Amazon, and then amazon starts showing you all these other books which are related to what you've bought, so it started showing me all these attachment theory books. And I was looking through them using the Look Inside feature. I found some bits that I really related to and I screenshotted them.” I pause. I don't know what to do now. I sit and ponder and T sits quietly and waits and then I continue. “So…. I'm wondering now what to do with the screenshots, whether to read them out or send them to you…” T asked “How many screenshots do you have?” “Three” T said “So while you were talking just now, I was thinking… why don't I get my phone and you can send me the first one? Then we can have a look at it.” “Oh, yeah ok” I send her the first screenshot on WhatsApp. I'm glad we can do this. If we met in the same room, I could just show her these things. But with us being over Skype, we have to be a bit creative about how we share things between us.

I know you wrote about this before but my last session some very obvious abusive things my mom did came up and Idk how to go about talking about it especially without dissociating by time the session ends. It's so vulnerable to talk about and explore and the feelings are so conflicting and I just don't want to talk about it but I know I have to. I'd also really like to not shut down  Answer: We've approached the subject very slowly over weeks and weeks, just hinting at it or saying one or two little things, so that gradually I've been able to stay present with it. I think you have to be able to trust your therapist that they won't push you too far each session (while also being able to push you just enough at times).We've also taken the last - minutes of the session to “unwind” (that's what T calls it) but basically to ground and get back to the present, which has worked really well for me. Remember that you don't have to talk about it all at once in one go. You can just talk about one small part of it, dip in and then move on to talk about something else. For me it's felt really important to feel like T is on my side with this, before I've been able to be fully vulnerable with how I felt about my mum. So that's been gradually building up over recent session as well, me saying things and watching for her response, I'm quite hypervigilant anyway to how others are responding to me.I hope you find a way to talk about it with your therapist when you're ready!

Doc ID: 14457, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Hi! I was wondering if I could have your thoughts. Something weird is happening with me and my therapist - while I'm sat a few minutes in the car decompressing after I see her leave the building, running to her car and driving off. It sounds ridiculous but I find it very strange that she is able to leave so quickly and I know it's just her job but it's like she's desperate to leave and is putting on her coat as soon as I close the door. Idk there's just something a bit upsetting about it I know I'm being ridiculous!   Answer: You're not being ridiculous. I think I might feel similarly. Could you mention to your therapist about how you feel? These things often tend to bother us until we bring them into the light and talk about them. In the absence of knowing, our brains make up stories to fill in the explanations. It's really useful to find out whether these stories are true because that helps us think more flexibly about other situations too.I noticed that my therapist was sometimes on WhatsApp  or  minutes after my session ended, and it really bothered me because it felt like she couldn't wait to jump on her phone as soon as she was done with me. (In hindsight, it was probably absolutely reasonable but in the moment I was like WHAAAT why aren't you sitting still considering all the profound things I've just said!) I mentioned it in session once and she was really reassuring, and now it's just become a non issue that doesn't bother me at all.

We were talking last week about you not fitting in at school…” I fidgeted and sighed and said “yeah I think I should say, in fairness to my mum and dad, that it's possible that they didn't know how much I wanted these things that would have made me fit in more.” With my mum, I aligned myself very much with her. I wanted to think the exact same as her. So if she said the stickers I longed to collect like everyone else were a waste of money and horrible, I wouldn't ask for them again because on one level I would not want her to think I disagreed with her. Almost like she expected me to take on her thoughts and I didn't want to upset her by having a different opinion. If she had known how much I wanted the stickers, maybe she would have given in and bought me some. But I wouldn't ask over and over again because that would show I had a different point of view to her, and I wouldn't do that to her. With my dad, I wouldn't dare ask more than once. Sometimes it was safe to ask once, and sometimes he would be super generous and buy more stuff than we'd even asked for. But sometimes he'd got incredibly angry, especially if he felt I was whinging. Whinging and whining was like a number one crime. The number of times he'd make my sister or I repeat ourselves because we said something in a whingy voice. “Say it again! In a non-whingy voice!” and we'd have to swallow our emotions down and repeat ourselves in a very measured non-emotional tone. Sometimes I didn't even think I was talking in a whingy voice. But if my dad said you were, then you were. There was no point arguing. My dad also liked to say “You're more likely to get it if you don't go on about it.” Well, how does anyone know that you want something if you can't speak about it? Is it some sort of power play where he wants to surprise us with something after he's made us give up?

She expected me to run a mile from the idea, but actually I would really be up for something like that. Not because our marriage is in trouble or at risk of breakdown, but just because it could help us communicate better and tune in to each other again. After all these years of therapy, I understand myself much better and I've changed a lot, and I don't think H has really been with me on that journey. We still work very well together practically as a team, but we don't have much time in our daily lives to connect emotionally. When we do have down time, we both are more comfortable just relaxing in our individual worlds. I said to T that I would need it to be not another thing that I am the driving force for, that I am pushing H into. Because then when I'm tired or feel like I can't be bothered with it, I would need H to be encouraging me to do it rather than feeling like he's got a night off from it.  I love love love the idea of being able to feel more connected and more open with H about what's going on for me, but I do not love the thought of the work that would have to be put in. Especially as the prospect of therapy coming to an end is out there, I would like to transfer some of my attachment to T onto H, but I can't. I just don't trust him to be a safe person for my emotions, and the thought of doing the work to build that trust feels uncomfortable. Maybe it's something for some point in the future, if life ever calms down enough.

Doc ID: 14452, distribution: 0.5381427406745022 ; Question: Hey! Just wondered how long it took you to get to the point where you could have an honest conversation with your therapist when she's done something wrong or something you're not happy with? I've had two therapists (over about  years) and never really got to that point at all, I feel like I've failed somehow - I so wish I had the open communication you and your therapist seem to have!  Answer: Hmm it took a while, and it was very much led by my therapist. She taught me how to do it and basically talked me through the process multiple times. It's definitely not something I would have learnt to do without her help, so please don't think you've failed. My therapist is really big on the therapeutic relationship and how that is the tool for change, but another therapist who works differently might not take the relationship in that direction.Honestly when I started therapy, I could barely speak in session I was so anxious. It is not my natural personality at all to tell people how they've upset me, and if my therapist hadn't been so encouraging and open and gentle, I wouldn't be able to do it at all. Now I can tell her if she's upset me, but there was a long period in the middle years of therapy, where I would just go to session and shut down if I was upset or hurt, and it would take so long for me to be able to let T know what was going on. I think early on I used to tell her by text because it was easier than talking, so I feel lucky that she allowed me to do that.

The therapist seemed like someone d would be able relate to and hopefully open up to. The therapist started off talking a bit to both of us about how therapy with her worked, which was really just standard therapy stuff that I'm familiar with so I felt quite comfortable with all that. Then she asked us what was going on and d said that I should tell her, so I explained what had led up to me making the appointment.After about  minutes, I'd pretty much summed up the situation so then they kicked me out and I sat in the waiting room and drank my coffee while they talked. When they came down, the therapist said d had done well. d didn't have much to say but when we got out I asked her a bit about it, and she said she would like to see her again. D also saw how much the sessions cost, as it was on the therapy contract she was holding. That was something I'd deliberately not told her, so it came as a bit of a shock to her. Anyway, we are away the next two weekends but I have booked her another session for the weekend after that. I really hope she feels a little bit more contained having had one session and having another session booked in. We will see how it goes.

T said she would always be honest and real with me. She said something else around that, but that's the bit I heard. Then she said let's talk about something lighter for a few minutes, how are your girls feeling about going back to school?  I wasn't ready to go up there yet though, I was still stuck on the honest and real. I stared into space for a few moments and then said “Will you always be honest and real?” I just wanted her to say, yes she would. I felt quite emotional thinking about being able to rely on what she said and not have to read between the lines. As a child, I was exceedingly good at reading between the lines and working out what was not being said but that I needed to know. T got sidetracked and started rambling about well she would try to be but might not be able to be because she's only human and etc etc. She went on for a couple of minutes, and then looked at me and asked “Is that what you meant?”  I shook my head, because it was so far from what I meant.  T smiled and said “Ahh well maybe we will have to revisit it next session because I don't think we have time now”, and I shrugged and said “Yeah…. maybe - but maybe it doesn't really matter.” I don't know whether I'll bring it up again next session or not.

Doc ID: 14380, distribution: 0.11893472067679695 ; “For the emotionally neglected, keeping them in therapy not only allows them to do the work of therapy, it is the work of therapy. In essence, the emotional neglect patient will benefit greatly from experiencing a healthy dependence on her therapist which, as a child, she was not able to feel with her parents.”  I love this quote from Jonice Webb's book “Running on Empty”. I relate a lot to her descriptions of childhood emotional neglect and I also feel like this exact thing has been a big part of my work in therapy. It has been hard work to stay in therapy, especially early on where I was caught up in a push-pull of really difficult attachment stuff. Parts of me started wanting nothing more than to move in with my therapist and live under her desk, while other parts of me were really terrified by the way she was becoming so important to me despite me trying really hard to keep a protective barrier up against her. I did not want to be dependent on her! Apart from me having had it instilled in me from very young that I must grow up and act older than my years and cope with stuff on my own because that somehow is 'good for me', I also had learnt that people upon whom I was dependent had great power to wound me, and I was not planning on letting that happen again. I was % prepared for T to shout at me at some point in therapy, and I told her several times that if and when she did, that was it - I was leaving therapy and not coming back because now I'm an adult I do not have to stay in these situations and so I am not going to. I imagine that must have unknowingly told her a lot about my childhood, well before I was able to tell her actual accounts of it. My therapist always told me that needing her was ok and it would not last forever. She said I would grow through the dependence, just like a young child starts off extremely dependent on their parents but gradually learns to do more things for themselves, and then grows through the teenage stage where they may clash and argue, and then reaches adulthood where with firm foundations they naturally feel more ready to branch out by themselves. I have found this to be true and certainly my dependence on my therapist now is a whole level less than it has been in the past. Plus we've had our share of ruptures and boundary pushes on the way. That's not to say that the dependence never goes backwards. Sometimes it does, just like in real life sometimes hard circumstances mean an adult needs to depend on other people more for a season. So many people over the years have queried whether I am overdependent on my therapist, but T has always reassured me that she is ok with it and I am ok and she can see me making progress. She has encouraged me to relax into it and just go with it. It has been a massive learning curve, not just cognitive but also emotional. Now I am very comfortable with my dependence on my therapist in the place it is. I know it ebbs and flows and changes throughout the course of therapy and will continue to do so in a healthy way.

Doc ID: 16490, distribution: 0.5254890194444933 ; Therapy .. // emotional abuse  Ever since my therapist used the words “emotional abuse” two sessions ago, I've been trying to get my head round the concept. I started to think that maybe she would regret using those words because she just said them in passing and now here am I fixating on them. She's probably going to wish she'd never said it. So I asked her in session yesterday if she still thought that some of what went on was emotional abuse. (Don't be fooled, it took me several minutes to get that question out) In true therapist style, she wouldn't just say yes or no. She made me work for the answer.  She asked me what my gut feeling was, and I said it was that she had just said it to make me feel better in the moment but now she regretted it. We had a discussion about that. She said she didn't say things just to make me feel better. I said again “So are you saying yes or no to my question?” Slippery therapist, next she asked me how I would feel if she said yes she still thought it, or no she got it wrong. I said if you still thought it, I would feel…. relief… and I would feel… validated.  If you thought you'd got it wrong, I would feel like, ehh I knew it wasn't that bad, I was just being over dramatic. I probably made it sound worse than it was. T quoted back to me some things I'd written in my story and she pointed out how Not Normal these things were, and how contradictory it was for me to say it wasn't 'that bad'. I was trying really really hard with the eye contact at this point. T looked at me and said “That little girl being put through that and nobody stopping it! Yes comfort afterwards, but nobody putting a halt to it while it was happening. That was a misuse of power - that's what abuse is - over many years. It was emotional abuse.”  Finally she answered my question.

Doc ID: 15710, distribution: 0.43472886142549794 ; Therapy .. // after the bombshell  I managed to not completely shut down. T explained that she'd put a statement on her website about not taking new clients - she wondered if I'd seen it - and she just felt very aware that it was out there but it had gone unspoken between us, and so she wanted to bring it up so we could talk about it.  I had seen her statement, but I'd presumed she just wasn't taking any new clients during lockdown because it was difficult to start a new therapeutic relationship online. So I hadn't thought about it any further than that.  T then said lots of lovely things to me. I don't know if you'd call it damage limitation, but it was like she'd dropped this bombshell about retiring on me, and now she was quickly trying to catch me before I fell.  “I will never forget you Faith. You will always have a place in my heart. I really enjoy working with you. I do! I never think, oh no I have to see Faith today. You work so hard in therapy and you are always thinking… working on things. I know it's a therapeutic relationship that we have, but you can't have a real therapeutic relationship without having some elements of a normal relationship too. That's the privilege of a therapeutic relationship. In fact, it can be deeper than a normal relationship because you have the boundaries in place to make it safe to go deeper than you usually would be able to.” I listened to her and tried to let myself absorb all her words. The battle between shutting down or staying present was still going to and fro inside me. Gradually as she kept talking, repeating the same things, her voice soothed me and I started to feel calmer internally. After T had stopped talking, there was a pause. “So, what's going on in your head now?” I think I said something about how at least if T made the decision to end therapy, then I wouldn't feel regret for ending therapy myself. What if I decided to end, and then something happened and I needed T again. I'd be kicking myself. Whereas this way I would know I'd had no choice. T squinted at me and said she wasn't sure that was very therapeutic. To be honest, I think I felt a little bit gleeful. Maybe it's not therapeutic but it's what you've done T. I said I felt a little bit stubborn, “Well, now I don't have to make the decision myself about when to end”. T looked at me thoughtfully and said “hmm I think that's important… I'm not sure right now quite how, I'll have to have a think about it…”  We were coming to the end of the session and T said “I get the feeling that you were about an  or a  in terms of having a wobble when I told you, but how would you feel now?” I considered, “Maybe a  or ” “Ok that's good, it's come down a bit then. Was I accurate in saying an  or a ?” “Uh… yes… and I was having a wobble too in that I was nearly shutting down…. A few years ago I would have completely shut down for the rest of the session if you told me something like that. But I managed not to today.” T smiled and said I had done really well and it was good that I had noticed how much progress I had made.

I had things I wanted to talk about that I'd been holding all week, and I had been anticipating the sense of comfort and relief that would come from sinking in to the session and sharing them with my therapist.  We logged into Skype as usual and the connection was poor, so T immediately suggested she send me a Zoom invite. I think she's trying to change me over to Zoom, because this isn't the first time she's mentioned it. I'm sure it's fine, I'm just ridiculously resistant to change and I'm like “Noooo you live in my Skype app don't leave”. But anyway, Skype was misbehaving so we Zoomed instead and it was fine. I may even come to like it better because T has to send me the Zoom invite beforehand so it's like a call to therapy and that's quite nice. I said to T that I was super stressed because the builders next door were hammering away right behind the wall I was sitting in front of. I said I was worried it would be distracting for her or she wouldn't be able to hear me, and she said not to worry about her, she could hear me fine and if it got difficult she would put her earphones in, which makes it easier to hear voices. So far so good. I had my notebook next to me with a few notes of what I wanted to talk about this session, and I thought from the fact that T and I had also had a brief text exchange this week - where I had sent T my mum's Facebook post and a little comment, and she had replied “you are you and you are absolutely fine just as you are” - maybe she would be alert to the fact that I might need to talk about that.  Anyway, it seemed T had her own agenda.

Can I send you an email? She always says yes but I still ask her. I think it makes me feel better to give her a warning that I'm about to demand something from her. When she nodded, I asked “Uh… what do you talk about in supervision?” This came up because she said she had supervision the day after my last session and she said she would tell her supervisor how well I was doing. T tells me about the sorts of things she talks about, about how supervision gives her another perspective on her work with clients. And how it helps her see if her stuff is getting mixed up with the therapy work - “that can happen to therapists sometimes, you know it has happened to us a few times”.  “Mmm” I fidget a bit. “There sounds like there's an “and” in there….” T comments. “I think…. I'm just a bit suspicious of your supervisors sometimes. Like you said last week that when you first moved away your supervisor said that you should stop working with me online and get me to find someone else face to face. Or one time you said about your supervisor not feeling like I was making progress fast enough.” T says she doesn't remember that last exchange, but I definitely remember her telling me about it. I think it was actually a comment made in her peer supervision group, and her actual supervisor subsequently disagreed with it and said that I was doing fine, but anyway, it all adds to my general suspicion of supervisors.  T reassured me that this isn't the same supervisor as the one that didn't like her doing online therapy with me, and she has been working with this one for  years now. This current supervisor also said she was very proud of me, so I hope her and T had a nice conversation about how T must definitely be helping me because here is the proof in my life.  At the end of this bit of conversation was when T said that she knew she could talk about these things with me because she trusted me that if it brought up difficult stuff for me, I would trust her enough to bring it up with her. That sort of thing makes me feel really warm inside, which of course I display by keeping a completely blank face and barely saying anything. T once said early in on therapy that my face was inscrutable. That's because I'd perfected my blank face because I'd learnt it as a child that it wasn't safe to show emotions. I work every session on letting expressions show on my face but I still get spooked and shut them down very easily.

Doc ID: 16825, distribution: 0.16530317203245057 ; Mum waffle   I was away last weekend with my mum and my sister. I also saw my mum the weekend previous to that. I find it very difficult to talk about her in therapy and be able to reflect on our relationship past and present at a period of time like this when I see her so much. However I won't see her for a while now so I can try and be more objective again. For anyone reading this, remember I have all the good things about my relationship with my mum safe in an imaginary box.  While we were away this weekend, two things struck me. First, I noticed how judgemental my mum can be. Talking about an old friend she stayed with recently, she makes statements like “Oh she just needs to….” “She should do….” and “If only she would…”, all of which imply that my mum knows the one and only way to navigate life and if everyone was just the same as her, they would be much happier. Something about this is tugging at me. I think she said similar things all through my childhood, only I didn't recognise it as being judgemental or overcritical, because I just thought my mum knew best. I didn't realise her words were opinion, because I accepted them as facts. I think the eating disorder voice in my head says similar things, states opinions as facts. “You'll be much happier if…” The second thing that happened was as we were coming home, our flight got in much earlier than expected so my mum and sister said they would catch an earlier train. I said I couldn't because my ticket was only booked for one specific train. It turned out my mum and sister had the same type of ticket, but they were planning to hop on board their (separate) trains and just blag. I said I wasn't doing that because it would make me too stressed and anxious. My mum thought I was being ridiculous and spent ages trying to tell me what I needed to do and to convince me that there would be no problem, and even if there was I would just have to get off at the next station.  I pulled a face, and in the end she threw her hands up and said “oh well, you just wait and get the next train then” in a weary frustrated kind of way. My sister said to her “You're not supposed to speak to anxious people like that! You're supposed to say 'I can see you're finding this situation very difficult.'” My mum rolled her eyes and repeated the phrase to me in a sarcastic tone of voice. The frustrating thing is, I know my mum knows how to respond to people with anxiety because she has worked with them in the past. However when it comes to me, she thinks I'm just being pathetic, and if I would just pull myself together and be sensible, I would be fine. I have been anxious all my life but I have learnt to shove it down and just get on with it because my mum has always had this sort of approach. No space or validation for my own feelings, so I never learnt how to deal with the difficult ones. This is what I'm going to talk about in therapy tomorrow.

Anyway, I managed to be in front of the laptop and ready at , so that was a start. Knowing I'm paying almost £ per minute for therapy is a good motivator to haul my brain into gear and make good use of the session time. T asked me if I had a list to talk about today, and I said I just had 'faulty thought patterns' which was leftover from last weeks list. I said “I have this thing which I am struggling with, but every time I try and explain it to you, I don't seem to be able to explain it very well and it just ends up feeling a bit frustrating.” T said that maybe it's because she tries to rescue me and find solutions and what I really need is her just to hear me. I nodded. You can't find a solution to a problem unless you properly understand what the issue is to begin with. The issue is basically that I go to a coffee shop and on the way, I think I would like to have cake of some sort while I'm there…. or in previous variations on the theme, I think I would like to have a fancy drink rather than a basic americano. Then I get to the coffee shop and I stand in the queue and I suddenly think why am I having cake? (or fancy drink), think of all that excess, why not just stick to the basic meal plan, I don't need these extras. And I end up leaving with just the americano after all. I know this sounds quite minor but it spills over into other areas of life and it feels like an aspect of my life where the eating disorder is still in control and that really frustrates me. T explored it a bit with me. I said that the faulty thought patterns is that it's all-or-nothing. [redacted a bit of explicit talk of behaviours] I said I know there's diets that are like : where you stick to the plan % of the time and eat what you like the other %…. “But I just think, well why not stick to the plan % of the time?” That genuinely really puzzles me. Why would you deliberately do something at less than %? I think if I could find way to fix this thinking, then I would have cracked this whole dilemma. In the coffee shop, I end up feeling like a disappointed child who's had something promised to her and then had it taken away at the last minute. Which I don't think is a feeling from childhood, because I don't think that happened to me very often. My dad over-indulged us and my mum didn't really indulge us, but neither of them promised stuff and then didn't follow through on it. T asked me if I thought the all-or-nothing thinking came from childhood, could I remember any incidences of it? Then she retracted the question because we only had a few minutes left. Then she asked what my gut reaction to her question was, did I think yes or no. She said maybe it wasn't from childhood, maybe it was something I had constructed as an adult. Now I've had time to reflect, I don't think it's from childhood particularly. The cake in coffee shops and being unable to eat sweet snacks at home without chewing and spitting both feel like different faces of the same issue. So if I could crack it from one aspect, it would bring freedom in lots of areas. We didn't come up with any answers this week but we will keep thinking about it next week.

But I know better.

I know it doesn't work that way.

“Am I going to live in this cycle forever?” she asks me, “Using and then going to treatment only to relapse again once I leave?”

As I lay curled up on my couch after the call ends, I want to pretend like my struggles are gone and that I am somehow beyond where she is. I want to tell myself I am not in the exact same place, wanting desperately to go back to my demons and be pulled back into a vicious cycle of sickness.

                                                                       ….. Sitting in dark, empty apartment, I pull my blanket around my shoulders and wait for the overcast Sunday skies to break into rain.

I've been flirting with death again lately, letting myself slip here and there, justifying it all by saying it's just one time, what does it really matter?

I know where this path leads, know that this ends in shivering cold misery and obsessive weight loss, that it ends in hospitals and feeding tubes and months and months of trying to undo the damage. Maybe that's the point, though. Maybe that's what I am subconsciously working towards.  Because I miss it, in some twisted way; I miss being sick.  I miss living in a mental fog, not being able to think straight or concentrate on anything. I miss lacking energy, feeling faint, feeling like I was on a high when I didn't eat for days. And most of all, I miss dying.

On the spectrum of life and death, I have hovered on the side of death for the past ten years. There was something comforting in not having to face the world, in hiding behind sickness and death. Not having to deal with pain and past trauma, not having to feel, not having to know what it is to be human; the eating disorder was a safe haven, a protection from a terrifying world.

When I existed in a too-small, fragile body, it felt as if there wasn't room in my body for the pain. As though the less mass I took up on the planet, the less space there was for the hurt. As though I could starve myself small enough to not feel, starve myself small enough to rid myself of my trauma.                                                                    …..

Despite all of the hard work I've done over the past few months, all of the intensive therapy and self-reflection, the pull is strong to go back to what was killing me. The siren song of the disorder is lulling me towards the water's edge, calling me deeper and deeper in, lulling me towards drowning.

“There are so many good things in your life,” the woman tells me, “you have so many opportunities that are life-giving. You have to be healthy for those to happen. You can't have both sickness and your dreams.”

She is right that I cannot have those things without being healthy, but being healthy is strange and disorienting. Being closer to the side of Life is uncharted territory and I'm not sure that I like it. I long for the familiarity of a dying body. I don't know how to live in this new place, a place where I use my words to be heard rather than my physical self.

I am so afraid of being okay, of not being in crisis, of stability and health.

I am so afraid of having the power in my own life.

                                                                 ….. “You spend all your time escaping and avoiding,” says the therapist, “and you're never really present in your own life.”  I started to run back to the eating disorder a few days ago, deciding to relapse and let myself lose control to the Monster again. I would have kept going for as long as I could hold out when a friend reached out to me and asked to talk. In that moment, I had a choice to make: to show up for my friendships, to be fully present and have deep, meaningful conversations with people I care about, or lose myself in the haze of starvation, becoming a ghost of a woman again, never really there. I chose, this time, to be present.  There is something to that, I think. The most powerful moments in my recovery process have been when people have been fully present with me in my experiences of suffering and pain, walking alongside of me through the darkness. There is something there, something important about the idea that presence brings healing. But for myself, I have avoided presence like the plague, running from anything that makes me feel my emotions, and when pushed to an uncomfortable place, dissociating to protect myself. The eating disorder, in it's desperate attempts to avoid the present moment, has caused me to become so disconnected from my own self, from my body and my own internal experiences.  But what I want - meaningful connections with other people - requires me to show up. It asks of me what I am most afraid of doing: experiencing the range of human emotions in all of its messy glory. It asks me to stop running, always running, from pain.  This healing isn't one sided though: I am healed through the presence of others as much as through my own home-coming to my body and emotions. It is in this dual relationship of fully embodied presence that I am beginning to mend, bit by bit.  I don't know if I'll ever stop missing the sickness fully, or ever really get over the desire to go back to it. But I believe deeply in the power of presence. Not as a magic cure, but as something to hold onto in the midst of the storm.

It was also hard to talk about with her because I worried that it crossed the boundary between her as a therapist and her as a mother, especially if I texted her about it out of session when she wasn't necessarily in therapist mode. We did talk about it and I told her how competitive eating disorders are and how unhelpful it was to know what she'd told me. I also asked her if her daughter was well now and she said yes she was.The session after that, T said she had taken it to supervision and her supervisor had thrown her hands up in horror and said “what did you do that for?” in reference to her telling me. So I felt quite validated by that.I really don't know any details of her daughter's eating disorder or even what type it was. Someone on tumblr pointed out to me at the time that I am probably getting a much better deal from her being my therapist, than her ed-daughter is getting from her as a mother. Because therapy is so one-way and boundaried whereas family relationships with eating disorders involved are so much more complicated. That was very helpful and I felt much better after thinking about that.

Doc ID: 14593, distribution: 0.4608210286819131 ; Therapy .. // ending therapy thoughts  We had  minutes left after we'd spoken about the girls and their health kick and I asked T if we could talk about something else. I said that a year ago, at the start of , I'd said to her that maybe  would be the year I end therapy.  “Oh yes, I remember” T said. It actually came up in the same session as she said  might be the year she decided on a retirement date. Clearly neither of us followed through on our intentions. Probably for my therapist, it was because Covid and lockdown came and disrupted all the potential post-being-a-therapist-retirement plans she had . “I genuinely thought  might be the year I ended therapy, but then quite a lot of quite deep stuff came up in . So it was good that I didn't stop therapy. But now I'm thinking, how do I know when it actually is time to end and there's nothing more that's going to come up?” That's when T said that she would know when it was time for us to end therapy, which I found a very reassuring statement. She has said before that it would be unethical for her to keep me in therapy for longer than I need, and that like a baby bird leaving the nest she might have to give me a little push when it is time to leave. So I do trust her that if she says it's still beneficial for me to stay in therapy then that's truly what she thinks, she's not just saying that to keep me as a source of income for her. She also said she thought that I also would know when it was time to end therapy, because we would stop diving down and talking about deep things and most of our conversations would become more surface level. I am still wondering whether the “time to end therapy” is a realisation that will just come upon me one day - will I just start to feel like I'm done? - or whether it's a date that I will have to set and then choose to work towards it.  I kind of planned that after we'd had this conversation, I would move it onto talk about a connected issue. I said one rather confused sentence about the connected issue, and T asked me if I could explain a bit more. Then I noticed the time and that we only had three minutes left, and I thought I didn't want to manage to get out what I was trying to say, only for us to end the session. Although sometimes that's helpful, at other times it makes it harder to bring the topic back up in the next session because a bit of the emotional charge has drained out of it once I've said it once. So I wrestled with the thoughts for a minute and then I said “uh I don't have much time left”. T said “Does it feel a bit too deep to dive into so close to the end?” and I nodded. So instead, T moved the conversation onto something lighter and we spent the last couple of minutes of the session talking about whether anyone round us still had Christmas lights up outside.

It was a good session, in one of the varying ways you could define a “good” therapy session. Connected, emotional, flowed. Talked about stuff I didn't know I was going to talk about and didn't talk about all the things I thought I might talk about. Just after therapy was finished, the supermarket delivery arrived. Unfortunately it didn't arrive outside our house as our road is impassable due to the snow. So it arrived at the main road junction with our road, and H and I trekked down there with sledges and rucksacks and towed it all back home. d FaceTimed from uni and we had a lovely chat. She was sorting the paperwork for her house next year and sighing over how she hates being an adult. Lol. I agreed being an adult sucks sometimes. It prompted me to say we needed to try and move her phone contract into her name, so that she could take over responsibility for it. I had an idea it might be tricky to get her first phone contract when she has no credit history at all, so I said I'd ring the phone company and see how they thought we should go about it and whether we could do it but keep her same phone number.  Naively thought I'd give the phone company a quick ring before lunch. Over an hour later, after I fell through some sort of rabbit hole with the sales guy, I'd upgraded d and d to new phone contracts and new phones, all still in my name. I must be a sales person's dream. I wasn't intending to do that at all, but you know how they convince you that if you don't do it now you'll never get an offer as good again. I hope he got some good commission from it, because he was very lovely. Apparently in  months time, we can apply to move the contract into d's name and see if they'll do it.  By now it was .pm and I was just updating H on the phone situation, when d appeared downstairs and asked me if I'd go for a walk with her. She's on a daily walking streak and I'm trying to take her up on every situation where she reaches out for connection. So off we went on a walk. Still had no lunch but d had just made some banana bread with dark chocolate chips in, so I ate a chunk of that before leaving the house. It turned out d had quite a long walk in mind! We trekked for an hour and a half and she talked and talked about nothing deep but still entertaining. She's really good company actually.  When we finally got home (after two more snow showers fell on us), I started making a new recipe for tea - the Giant Burrito Cake out of my Bosh! Cookbook. It's tortilla wraps laid out round the oven dish with a filling of layers of rice and black beans, cheese, cooked sweet potato slices, peppers and onions, cherry tomatoes and spring onion, and a squeeze of lime juice, then repeat all the layers, fold over the wraps so it's all wrapped up like a parcel, and bake it in the oven. When it's baked, you can tip it out just like a parcel and cut slices out of it. We ate it for tea and it was amazing. I had some more banana bread for dessert. Now I'm finally sat on the sofa. Tired but in a good way. I'm not quite sure how the day went by in such a blur of busy-ness, but it's been good. Time for a couple of hours of Netflix and cross-stitch now.

I told her about doing the covid swabs and how the gagging part is kind of triggering but not in the sense that it makes me tempted to start purging, just that it brings back physical memories. T said she was glad that it wasn't making me have increased urges to purge. After I'd got all that out of the way, T said “So with all that going on, have you had any time to think about what we talked about last week?”  I fidgeted a bit and stared away and said “Mmm yes, I have thought about it. Uh, yeah….. uh… it felt good, when you said what you would have liked to have said to my parents. That felt like you were on my side, and it's easier for me to believe my feelings when it feels like you are on my side rather than when you're staying neutral.”  T nodded. I feel like I'm spoon feeding her this a bit - “I need you on my side for this”. I don't seem to able to validate my own childhood feelings myself. Probably because I'm still worried about my feelings being “wrong”, which I know comes from childhood where I learnt that mostly my own feelings *were* wrong and what was right was working out what other people's feelings were. Whatever those were, they were the “right” feelings about the situation. “Um, and then when I was talking about that protocol that I found, for moving into different school years, and you said that it wouldn't have been around  years ago… well then I felt like you were making excuses for them again…” T looked a bit thoughtful and said “Mmm yes… I can see that… “ “I mean, maybe it wasn't around then, but presumably they wrote it at some point because there was a need for it. To stop children being moved around years in an unmanaged way…. At the end of it, it says that all these people should agree the move - the parents, the headteachers of the school, the educational psychology service… it just seems….” I drifted off into silence, staring into space. “It just seems…” T prompted “Um, it just seems, that there were all these adults involved in making the decision…. like there was me, over here, a child…. and all these adults over there making a decision together and any one of them could have decided that it wasn't a good idea - but none of them did…”  (A note to my therapy notes, I'm not talking about this to cast blame or assign responsibility. It's really more about processing all the feelings around it, all the thoughts that come up. I'm not trying to reach any particular position at the end of it, I just want to explore my feelings and say some of the things that I've never had a chance to say.) I carried on to say to T that I could have said no, to moving up the second year. My parents did ask me how I felt about it so I did have a chance to say no, and if I'd said no, I'm pretty certain it wouldn't have happened. However I can't really blame myself on that front, it's not surprising that I didn't say no. I'd received messages all my childhood up till then that being bright and high achieving and doing everything younger than everyone else was a good thing and made adults pleased with me and made me special, so why wouldn't I have wanted to continue that?

It feels like it was a fairly massive session and there's so many bits of it I need to process and want to remember. T said “I'm really glad you've been able to talk about all this now. I wonder what stopped you bringing it up last session?”  Oh my goodness! Is she kidding me? I tried and tried to redirect her last session and explain what I needed and say that we had gone off track about what I wanted to talk about, but it was like she was on a completely different plane. “I TRIED!!” I said agitatedly. “You said we are going round in circles, but I didn't feel like I was going round in circles. I kept trying to explain things but I was like you were just going round and round in a little circle and I couldn't get you to break out of it!” “I'm so sorry about that,” T said, “I'm sorry I wasn't tracking you and I missed how you were feeling.” She has spent a lot of this session apologising. I appreciate that she is taking responsibility but I feel uncomfortable with putting her “in the wrong” and making her feel bad. Hello Faith who likes to take all the discomfort on herself to make everyone else feel better. I like what she said about tracking me though. I'm not really sure what that means in practical terms, like is it a thing therapists think about? But anyway whatever it is, I liked the thought that it was something she usually did. And usually gets right. She carried on, “I could tell something wasn't working and that's why I put a stop to it.” That was when she firmly moved the conversation on last week to another topic. I knew she had done it at the time and I allowed myself to be taken along with it and to leave the first half of the session behind. There was no guarantee we would have got anywhere if we'd spend another  minutes talking about the same thing so it was a good move to salvage some of the session and use it for something useful.

I understand that - but you're not there now…. you can say anything here… so go ahead and say it!” I started talking about my mum's values and how she overvalued academic achievement, so I imagine that she didn't really think too much about the emotional impact on me now or in the future. My mum had her own values, she wanted to bring us up very innocent I think. She had no interest in keeping up with the latest trends. “That was ok for her, at home, but we had to go out into school and mix with the other children, and it was hard, to feel different.” T looked like she was still trying to understand what I was saying so I tried to explain further.  “Mmm, so this will sound like the most stupid shallow thing, but it's just the first example that comes to mind… so my parents never watched soap operas… Coronation Street or Emmerdale or Eastenders, all that kind of thing, and all my friends parents did, and my friends would always be talking at school about the plot lines and the characters, and I just had no idea who they were talking about. My mum thought soap operas were a waste of time, and she thought the storylines weren't appropriate, so she wouldn't have them on the TV.”  T got that and she added, “oh yes, and your mum wouldn't let you watch certain children's programmes either, would she?”, which was something we'd talked about the week before. I said no, she wanted to keep us quite innocent and in her world and that's all very well but we had to go out into the outside world, and I don't think it ever occurred to her that made it hard for us socially. It's been something I've always been very mindful of with my own children, I've never wanted them to feel left out or different in that way. I said the equivalent now would be like banning your kids from having tiktok, snapchat, Instagram etc. That's great when you're all at home and your kids can have other activities, but then they have to go to school each day and all their friends are talking about these apps and who said or did what in them, and your kids just can't join in and then they're left out - or worse, they're the weird kids who don't have these things…  We ran out of time at this point. We were already  minutes over because the internet had played up and T had had to move rooms to get a better connection. I was very spacey having spent so much of the session back in childhood. I could have done with T helping me with a bit of grounding, I'm sure she could see I was struggling to get fully back to the present. She was scheduling for next week and I was half there and half not, she repeated herself and then told me about a week in October when she won't be here. “But I am here next Tuesday, so I'll see you then.” We said goodbye and I managed to get myself present enough to be able to click off the call.

I was messaging with my sister about it, because it was difficult to speak about it to my local friends for various reasons.  After texts back and forward, my sister sent me a message that said “I think that whilst we had a very happy and settled childhood, I don't think our parents were very communicative about the 'real world'” and then a specific example. I know my sister doesn't think every moment of our childhood was happy because we have spoken before of things that occurred in our household that she knew didn't happen in her friends houses. But 'happy and settled' is still the story we tell each other. T knows it's not completely true too. I still want to believe it's true, but I know we have spoken of things in therapy that T would not class as happy. When I think of them outside of myself, I would not class them as happy either.  I spoke about how many conversations with us my mum must have avoided because they were too upsetting for her and she couldn't face them. I'm reminded of my comment from the previous week that it felt like sometimes she emotionally abandoned us.  I said I felt angry with my mum. Even when I've been struggling in some of the situations I find most difficult, when it feels like I'm falling in a black hole and I can't get grounded, even then I manage to pull it together for my children, no matter how much it costs me afterwards. So I feel angry that my mum couldn't do the same for us. These feelings are new to me. I've been very aligned to my mum all my life. I take on her feelings, thoughts and opinions. T thinks I did this partly because I needed her as my comforter against my dad's anger. I'd like to write a nice wrapping up of the session but I think what happened was we ran out of time and we just left it all where it was and took the last  minutes to unwind and ground back in the present. Now I can't emotionally connect back with it to write about it the way I usually do, so this will have to do. It has actually been really helpful to write this out because it has provided some connection back with the session.

 i'm kind of terrified, kind of unstable, but it's not even about food. it's like, hey, i'm working on getting better, trying hard and i have for so many years now. what the fuck is going on? my whole past seems so surreal. are my parents … really my parents? they seem just like strangers, on the other hand it still makes me feel strongly to interact with them - just different feelings every time. sometimes i get panic attacks, sometimes i turn into a full on zombie and won't show any expressions or talk, sometimes i get so angry and it is far from any normal kind of rage that i have ever felt, sometimes i feel fragile and very sad, and sometimes, rarely, i even feel hopeful and i am okay with seeing my mother the group homes, psych wards, moving out when i was , it really did something to me. sure, i was one of the lucky ones, getting out in time and ending up in a therapy group home, being offered many opportunities and getting chances. unfortunately though, these places always come with tons of triggers and unstable people, and a group home can never really be family-like, it does not even come close. these different groups, new caregivers, people moving in and out constantly, people freaking out frequently  also, the  emergency/short-term group homes i went through before, all while i was still , some things have happened there that i still fail to understand. back then, i somehow survived it, clinging to my writing, food restriction and some sort of numb acceptance. but … it probably cannot end well to keep up to  young girls, ages -, in a house like that. no phones, no money, not allowed to go outside - to protect those who were there anonymously. nobody there who wasn't taken from home for a reason, nobody who wasn't in some way traumatized or had mental issues, and if you didn't look out for yourself, nobody did. this place … it turned many of the older ones into monsters. selfish and aggressive and angry, leaving out their frustration and fear on each other, but also on those who just went numb and quiet. i suffered, writing being my saviour, but most of the time these memories are repressed. when i read my writing from back then now, it makes me shiver. nothing was safe, people even stole used underwear, and you never had space for yourself, we did not even have a garden, and it was not uncommon to have new roommates every day. it was like being imprisoned, but to protect us, i guess. people coming and leaving every day, nothing unusual. yet i would always have chosen to stay, if my other option had been to go back to my parents, yes, if i had been given a choice afterwards, the therapy based group home i was referred to, mainly because of the suicide attempts (all while i was still ) and selfharm … oh, in comparison, a dream. i had sworn to myself i would do anything within my power to never be forced into a psych ward again, i worked on my issues and actually managed to avoid that step - there were relapses with selfharm, especially hitting myself was something that flared up over and over again, i had started it in the emergency group home, being out of opportunities, and i also still had these suicidal thoughts, terrible mood swings, increasingly often panic attacks, depressive episodes, boundary issues and of course my food problems, but despite some very bad moments, i always was able to avoid being taken to the psych ward. breakdowns still come frequently to this day, including everything, but i am able to handle it a lot better, reaching out before it is too late, riding out the waves, keeping everything in a safe way without longterm harm to my body or mind. something else i have learned is to … not deal with everything at once. sometimes i'm tired and i don't want to take a shower, you know? i still do, although on my bad days i sit in the shower, but that's fine - i still do take the shower. which i know is not possible for everyone, sure, nobody feel offended or bad please, it's just not one of my biggest struggles. i do things bit by bit if possible, to avoid being too overwhelmed. usually, it's pretty good no idea what my point is in writing this? well, everything that happened in my life, it feels very far away and surreal at this point. i suppose i will never be able to fully let it go - for example how very jumpy i am, it is something everyone around me is aware of, because it cannot be hidden, my reaction comes instantly and is out of my control. will it ever go away? or is the way my father treated me forever going to haunt me like this? who knows … i'm better than i used to be, for sure. i can cope with things better, i'm legally an adult and i do not depend on my parents, i live by myself, i managed to still finish school with a , gpa and have all the opportunities, am right now doing my dream job. hell, it could be a lot worse, right? also, how i was diagnosed and labelled - it's not what i base my worth on and i do not see it as a constant, but to this day it makes me feel strange to think that … yes, during the general diagnosis they also tested my IQ, which was done in primary school as well due to me being overly bored and hating school, both times resulting in me being declared “gifted”. well, i guess i have a good memory, i can read pretty fast and understand things easily, but do we need this label? those who know about it, like every caregiver in the group homes for example because they read all the papers, have always treated me a bit differently. it's like people have higher expectations, which sometimes may sure be justified, but in general it is so offputting. the human brain and “intelligence” are way too complex to be described by a simple number, and me, it is true that i get bored easily and often have to wait for others to understand things, but that's about it. i'm human, please just treat me as that but there is this problem, how easy it is to let go of people, how hard to let them in. how i turn on people, suddenly feeling no emotions toward them anymore. i do have friends and i am social, but it always feels like i am just pretending? pleasing people, craving closeness, but not actually feeling it and being scared of commitment? i have learned how to behave, how others behave, i know how to act in certain situations, but it does not come from my heart?  i am weird today, sorry to everyone who actually read this far. despite a lot of guilt and a need to procrastinate, i'm going to prepare and eat dinner now. my weight cannot slip further

One baby was asleep and the other was awake having a feed but after she was finished with that she mostly just lay peacefully on the bed while T and I spoke. T asked me if I'd had any time to think about anything this week, or if I had a list of things to talk about. I said not really and not really.  Just recently I've noticed that I feel really comfortable with T now. Like I could just curl up next to her and confide everything in her. It's a new feeling and it makes therapy feel more comfortable and less anxiety-inducing. Perhaps my brain finally believes that she will accept anything I bring to the session and won't judge it/me. I started to talk about how hard it felt last session to talk about being angry with my mum. I realised I could think about it and maybe write about it, but talking about it out loud was really difficult.  “Last session you asked me if one adult should tell another adult what to eat, and I know the answer should be no, but also if I said that, I had to admit that my mum was wrong… and that was really difficult.” “Mmm yes… almost like your head knew the answer but your heart had a different answer?”  I nodded. Then I tried to say something else but the words got stuck halfway out and would only form disjointed sentences. T helped me out by putting into words what she thought I might be going to say. She got it spot on. I said yes, I never disagreed or created arguments with my mum because I didn't want to upset her. Her being upset would upset me so much and I couldn't bear it. Yet my girls don't seem to be bothered by upsetting me. And it's hard not to feel from that that they don't care about me so much.  T talked about how it was good the girls have space to express their opinion. And it's not that they don't care about me, it's just that they are going through normal teenage growth. She asked me how I handled it, and I said I basically had to keep giving myself a pep talk and reminding myself that it was ok and I could withstand this and they need to see that I can withstand them having a different opinion to me. But it still upsets me. “It's like that head/heart thing again” T said, “Your head knows it's just them being teenagers, but your heart is upset about it. I think there's something more in there about that… hmm but I'm not sure what it is at the moment…”

My adult self knows that the next two weeks over Christmas and New Year will go super fast and I will not miss therapy particularly. I'm securely attached enough to T that I can feel the connection with her even when I don't see her, plus I have little strategies to boost that connected feeling such as I can look on WhatsApp and see when she was last online, and I can read her past messages to me, and I have the bowl she made me (which I dithered over bringing away with me but didn't in the end - I didn't want to have to explain it to anyone else who saw it and I was also worried it might get damaged in transit). T asked me how it felt going back to stay at my parents house after everything we'd just talked about. I thought about it. “I think…. uh I think I will feel a bit more separate from them. And a bit more adult”. T and I have talked recently about my mum and I being quite enmeshed. Not in the typical way I would think of enmeshed as being, but more in a way of me continually trying to align my thoughts and beliefs alongside hers. A sort of virtual enmeshment maybe. Now I'm facing the reality that there was emotional abuse going on and my mum did not stop it.  My parents are really coming off their pedestal as I realise more and more not only were they not perfect but they actually got some things very wrong.

I had just spoken with T about wondering whether my parents worried about me going off to university at a young age. I felt that T's response to that was quite invalidating. I can't remember now exactly what she said but something about not assigning blame and that my parents loved me. It seems like we have done all this work in therapy getting to an acceptance that my parents weren't perfect, yet now every time I allow myself to express a little spark of anger or even dissatisfaction or sadness over them and their actions, T jumps in and tries to smooth it all over. That just throws me right back to my old thought patterns that clearly my parents were great and it's me that's somehow wrong, that the critical part of me that's rolling her eyes and saying 'ffs Faith you make such a big deal out of nothing' is right. “It always feels like you're defending them” I said to T, in a resigned tone of voice. “Oh no, no I'm not defending them. I'm definitely not defending some of their decisions. I'm definitely not defending them pushing you ahead two years at school.” I shrugged at her. Her intentions and words don't seem to match up. She said “Maybe we need to talk some more next session about my views of their actions and their relationship with you” I nodded, and said a bit defeatedly “It feels like you're on their side” “I'm on your side, Faith. I'm definitely on your side.” We were nearly out of time and it felt like she was back-pedalling and trying to end on a reassuring note rather than a rupture. “I'm sorry if it feels like I'm not on your side. I really am. I think that's another thing that would be good to talk about next week… how does that feel?” I heard her saying that she was on my side. I'm glad she said it so many times because it did help it sink in and gave me something to hold on to. I still feel a bit let down by her though in the way that I brought some feelings to therapy and she shut them down without exploring what was going on for me. She seems so worried that she will damage my relationship with my parents that she won't hold space for me to say negative things about them. That makes it really hard for me to try and recalibrate my views of them, from them being perfect to a more realistic view that they did their best but they didn't get everything right.  “I know this is a really horrible place to end” - T emphasised the 'horrible' - “but we really are out of time now.” We had already gone ten minutes over to make up for the poor internet connection, which she'd offered earlier in the session, so I know that by the time we finished she did probably have to dash off to her next client or whatever. I just nodded in acceptance and we scheduled for next week and said goodbye. I noticed immediately afterwards that I hadn't said “thankyou” like I usually do at the end of a session. I guess I was still feeling her lack of attunement. There's a lot to process in next week's session.

Doc ID: 14822, distribution: 0.18892982778500225 ; This is a page from the book Unshame, by Carolyn Spring. I posted the quote in an earlier post. When I read it this weekend, it blew my mind. I wasn't looking for myself in the pages, but as soon as I read the line about feeling wrong for wanting to be close, it started resonating in my brain.   T and I have spoken in the last couple of weeks about how the way my body still reacts to my dad, even as an adult, is evidence of what I experienced as a child. I could get my head round that. But what the evidence still didn't tell me is, was the situation that: a) my dad was scary and I was normal Or b) my dad was normal and I was hopelessly non-resilient I thought about it some more and concluded that even if the problem was me, even if it was that I just cried too much and too easily, then maybe a parent's job should have been to treat that gently and find a way to connect without shaming or blaming. But I haven't had chance to discuss that with T and find out if she thinks it's a reasonable conclusion. Then I read this and it seems to back up my thought. That I have ended up thinking the problem was me. This page seems to say that it is entirely predictable that I would think the problem was me, because that's what children do. It's almost impossible for a child to conclude otherwise, because of the way their brains respond in the attachment relationship. Also the first underlined sentence brings up the yearning I had to be close to my mum as a child, and how she didn't seem able to welcome that, while at the same time letting me believe that what we did have was closeness. So confusing…. to believe that this avoidant dance was closeness. And now to try and sort all this out in my head. I honestly think it was easier to be arguing with my therapist about food and whether or not I was going to eat lunch. This afternoon I sent T this photo, and said that reading this blew my mind a bit even though I'm sure she has said it to me about a hundred times already. T replied that she was looking forward to picking up the pieces of my mind in our session tomorrow…. I wonder if I will be able to put into words what I have written in this post.

Doc ID: 16035, distribution: 0.23781450070325824 ; Therapy .. // part  // emotional regulation   Moving on to thing # on my list, I wanted to talk about what happened last week with d and her ears. As usual, it takes me some time to summon up the courage to say what I want to talk about. T sits patiently and waits. She won't rescue me anymore, she knows I get there in the end. Even after I told her what I wanted to talk about, I struggled to find where to begin. I think of ways to start, and then another part of my brain shoots them down. On reflection, that likely stems from my childhood. My dad had no patience for a story that wasn't thought through, or that rambled and didn't make sense. And all possible weaknesses had to be defendable. It means I overthink and freeze often when I'm trying to tell something. T gave me a way in by helping me get started, and then I was able to tell her the whole saga. I was really only telling it in order to talk about my texting dilemma afterwards, but it was actually good to explain at all. T was really encouraging and said I had done a good job even though it had cost me a lot emotionally. She started doing her psychodynamic thing, looking for links back to my childhood, but I said actually I really wanted to talk about something else and that was just the background. She smiled and said “Ok… and well done for interrupting me!” I told her about how I had a dilemma about texting her. I'm stuck between thinking that sooner or later I wouldn't be in therapy anymore and so she wouldn't be there for me to text her and so I should just learn to get on and cope with it on my own. And thinking that sooner or later she wouldn't be there and so I should make the most of it while she is there and (I got tied in knots here and ended up just reading out what I'd written which was “Make the most of it while she is there and it's ok to want to text her and I don't need to withhold it from myself”. I explained that withholding things from myself was an eating disorder behaviour, when the ed voice would tell me I could survive without x y or z and therefore I clearly didn't need to have it and must prove that I could manage without it. T said that she was absolutely happy for me to text her when I need to because she knows that I don't do it for just anything and only when I really need to. “I'm giving you something…. you're getting something from me. Some nourishment.”  Well that went a bit weird and therapisty 😳. I looked at her. She carried on, “One day you won't need to get it from me. You will be able to get it from people around you.” There was a long pause while I considered this. Eventually T said “You look like you're wrestling with some sort of dilemma?” I said “Yeah…. I'm just thinking…. that I did message H and my friends too, so I was trying to reach out to my real life supports too. But its like…. if a child falls over in the playground then their friends all try and make them feel better, and that's nice… but what they really want is an adult to come and look after them.” “Yesss…. that's to do with emotional regulation. When your feelings overwhelm you, you need someone more emotionally regulated to take your overwhelming feelings and digest them and give them back to you in pieces you can handle. That's what you didn't really get as a child, that regulation of your feelings. So you haven't had that experience and that's why it's difficult for you to do it for yourself now. That's why you sometimes need me to do it for you. But you are learning to do it for yourself, it's just a slow process. It doesn't happen fast. But that's ok.” I do think in some areas I am getting better at it. Like in fostering, sometimes something happens that makes me really mad or upset, and I used to always go to my manager and wail about it and she would speak to whoever and resolve it. But now I'm starting to think hang on, I can do something about this myself without having to run and get an “adult” to fix it for me. I'm learning to regulate myself more. Then T tried to do some grounding for the last few minutes and asked me a question about d, which I did answer but my brain was still on what we'd been talking about. So I said what I was thinking about… and then we were out of time.

Doc ID: 17075, distribution: 0.36494531261587704 ; Letter to my mum   At some point after my last therapy session two weeks ago, I had the idea to write a letter to my mum. Not one that I would ever plan to send to her, but I've been talking about my past relationship with her for a few weeks in therapy now and writing her a letter seemed a way maybe of sorting my feelings out a bit. A week ago when I was away for a night on my own with the baby, I finally had the chance to write the letter. It was amazingly difficult to find a couple of hours of peace and quiet to immerse myself in the letter writing, so when I had the prospect of that whole evening to myself, I knew I had to seize the moment. I hand wrote it because I felt that it would be more natural and the words would flow more authentically that way. Typing is good for lots of things because you can go back and rephrase your sentence and edit as you go, but I wanted this letter to just flow as it came out on to the paper.  While I was writing it, I felt so so grateful to T for making me feel safe enough to risk looking back at things without the “it was all perfect” filter on. Even while I was thinking what to write, I knew I was going to share the letter with T and that she would and could be able to contain everything I wrote and whatever it stirred up. After I finished it, I shut the notebook up and I haven't really had chance to look back at it since then. However now I have therapy tomorrow and I have to decide whether to tell T about it in advance or even email it to her so she can have it printed out. I think it might be too long to get through all in one session and if she can see it written down she will be able to follow along with what I'm reading and refer back to it. In preparation for that, when H went out for a bike ride this evening, I took advantage of the peace to type it all up so it's on my iPad now if I do decide to send it. I might destroy the handwritten version very soon because I don't want it to be found and read by anyone else.

Doc ID: 15104, distribution: 0.305187156856341 ; Therapy .. // Part two // just be on my side!!  T asked me some questions about how my  year old self felt about moving up two years at school, but I didn't really feel safe to answer her. My  year old self does not feel T is fully on her side. T seems to often go back to defending my parents or justifying their decision, or sometimes even just being too rational about the whole situation and it just makes me want to cry pitifully and say “why can't you just be on my side?” So I couldn't jump into further discussion with T without laying that out on the table. It took me some minutes to build up the courage to say anything… my brain gets carried away working out what to say. Eventually I took the plunge and said “Can I ask you something?” Of course T said yes. So I said, “Can we… you…. just presume - when I'm talking about this stuff - that I don't need you to defend or justify my parents? That I've got all that stuff on full volume in my head anyway and I don't need you to say it.” T said “Yes. So what have I said today that defends your parents?” That didn't feel defensive on her part, more curious as to how I experience what she says. “No, not today, nothing today, but you did last week. And I just… it took so long to get past me believing they were perfect and that it was me that was the problem…. and now I'm trying to see that not so good side as well but it seems like whenever I say anything negative about them, you're always defending them.” T said “OK, I think it would be helpful if you told me immediately, if you felt like I was defending them. Then we could speak about it.” I nodded. She continued “You did think they were perfect for a long while - I still remember our very first session, when you told me 'oh no, there's nothing wrong with my childhood, there's nothing to talk about there' - and I heard that as a warning from you. A sort of 'don't even go there' message. So I needed to let you find your own way to your conclusions and not put my thoughts on to you. If I'd told you some of what I was feeling, it would have pushed you back into defending them again. But now I think you've got there, you are more realistic about them. You know they weren't perfect and I'm trying to help you get to a more balanced view, without tipping too far over into anger at them.” “But maybe I just need to do that…. to go the other way for a bit… before coming back to a balanced view” “Yes” T said thoughtfully, “I was just thinking that. Maybe you do need to be angry at them for a while.” “It really feels like, whenever I say anything negative, then you try and be rational about it and then you leave me on my own with how I'm feeling. And I just want you to be on my side!”

Doc ID: 17232, distribution: 0.23626784288085698 ; Therapy .. // what did you ask me?  This session was a really hard one. It's also hard to write up because it was very stop-starty and I can't remember all of it. We talked about me being angry at my mum and how hard that feels. I discovered that while I can think about feeling angry at her and I can maybe even write about it, trying to talk out loud about it is a whole different thing. It's like the connection between my brain and my mouth just cuts out. There were a lot of times in the session when I fell silent to think about something T had asked me, and then I forgot what it was she'd asked me. It was all too difficult for my brain to think about so it kept shutting down. Towards the end, T asked me “Do you think it's right for an adult to tell another adult what they can and can't eat?”. She had me in a bind then, because obviously the answer should be “No”, but if I said that, then I was saying my mum had been wrong, and that felt like a betrayal of her. So I got really stuck for quite a long time, opening my mouth to say something and then being unable to say it, over and over again. There was turmoil in my brain between speaking and not speaking. We talked about how I imagined my mum would feel if I disagreed with her or told her she was wrong. I said how hard that was to think about, even when I knew my mum was not here in the room and wouldn't know about it. At this point, T reminded me of the exercise we'd done where I'd put all the good aspects of my relationship with my mum into a box and put it away in a safe place, so that it was protected and wouldn't be damaged by things I said now. I'd forgotten about that, so it was helpful of her to remind me (but would have been more helpful if she'd reminded me at the start of the session!) I shall remember it for next week though. My overall thought after this session had ended was that if I wanted to work through this stuff from the past with my mum, then I was going to have to get past the uncomfortableness of talking about her and push myself to jump into it. And hopefully this session of NOT being able to do that, will be the experience I need in order TO do it. Sometimes therapy seems to work like that, I have to have one session doing the opposite of what I want to do, in order to be able to have the added boost to push myself to do what I need to do.

We started by talking about this week's weight, which was the same as last week's. T asked me how I felt about it, and I said the ed was disappointed I hadn't lost weight but after I'd got over that, I was relieved because it meant we wouldn't have to spend the whole of this session arguing over food and eating. T smiled at that and I did too and it was a little moment of connection. We talked again about what had happened two sessions ago and T repeated her apology. I said it felt like she'd left me and I was on my own while she was headed off somewhere else and it was scary. She said that her part in what had happened was her responsibility and she hadn't been on good form that day. Then I tried to explain something more about it to her, and she got all muddled up and reflected it back to me all wrong. I put my hands up to my head in a moment of frustration and then rested my head on my hand and hid behind my hair while I took a few deep breaths.  I started talking again all in a rush and my frustration was evident, but gradually it calmed down as T realised what I'd been talking about to start with and I felt like she was understanding me better. I had a moment of feeling like we were getting our relationship back on track, but then she unfortunately chose to say “I feel like things have shifted since the start of the session. At the start of the session it felt like you didn't want to talk. But now I've talked about taking responsibility, it feels like things have shifted a bit? You feel a bit warmer to me?” Ugh it was too soon for that. Yes, I was starting to feel a bit warmer towards her, but she doesn't get to assume everything's getting back to normal yet. Immediately I felt irritated again and froze her out again. I didn't feel she'd worked hard enough to repair things and now it seemed she was trying to short cut it and be like “oh maybe everything's ok now?” and it most definitely wasn't. In fact it went several steps backwards at the moment she said this. She definitely picked the wrong moment to make her comment.

Doc ID: 15425, distribution: 1.0 ; I had a really positive therapy session yesterday and T said she was really proud of me. She also said she had supervision today and now she was excited to have something really good (my progress) to share. I have mixed feelings about that. On the surface I'm happy that she can share how well I'm doing and that I know % it is down to her help that I'm in this place, so I'm really happy and pleased for her to take that to supervision. On the other hand though, did that mean that she didn't have anything good to share before this? Was she going to go to supervision and rack her brains for what to say…. “Uh yeah Faith is still having the same old same old conversations with me about eating cake” and her supervisor would be like “Come on T, you have to move her through that”  I'm probably overthinking. I hope her supervisor was happy too and told T what a good job she was doing and that all the struggles with me were worth it.

T brought up right away the end of the previous session where I'd said it felt like she was defending my mum, and that she'd apologised for that and knew that she didn't need to defend her.  I had to sit for a few moments and push myself to move into therapy mode, choose to dive back into it all. I took some breaths. Eventually I said “it just seems…. not fair” T asked me what didn't seem fair. She made a suggestion which I can't remember now, but she was off on the wrong lines. However even when she gets it wrong, in telling her that's not what I was thinking it usually helps me get going and tell her what I am thinking. I talked about how my mum was throughout my childhood years, from about my age -. Her dieting beliefs (which I thought were ubiquitous in the nineties until T disillusioned me of that), and how much they impacted me. I thought lots of my mum's beliefs and actions around food were normal, because as a child we soak up what our parents tell us and we don't yet have any beliefs of our own to weigh it against. So for my mum it was “just a dieting phase” yet for me it became my core beliefs around food. That's what's not fair. My mum got to move on from it and decide she didn't want to eat like that anymore, but I got stuck with it because I didn't know any other way to eat.  I talked about some of the other things my mum did that I struggle with now. I said I didn't think they were right and that she shouldn't have done them. T said I am becoming more separate from my mum now. “You are able to think about things differently to her, and have different opinions about things. You can think that she might have been wrong about some things. That's a big change from when we started therapy, when you would defend her on everything.” T was really pleased about it and said it was good progress. I felt in that mind-boggling place where my perspective on my life shifts a little. The ground moves underneath me a bit. For a child, you grow up thinking your childhood is “normal”. It's hard to detach from that and look back objectively and try and view it in a different way.  Suddenly we were nearly out of time. T reminded me that we had all the good things about my relationship with my mum safely put away so it wouldn't be contaminated by anything we talked about, and she said we had space for me to talk about being angry with my mum for as long as it took. “You'll know when you've worked through it because it will feel different.” We scheduled for next week, which was the week I thought she was away. But it turns out it's the week after she's away. Yay so I get to see her on Tuesday after all which is only five days away.

She asked me if I was ok, because she said I seemed a bit flat. I said no I'm ok. I was suddenly a bit tearful because it felt like she'd said hi so gently, as if she knew it was going to be a tough session, and the quietness in her voice caught me a bit unexpectedly.  “Do you have any things to talk about on your list today?” I shook my head “Ok so shall we talk about this story that you sent me?” I nodded and T pulled across a print out of it she had right there next to her. “How did it feel to write this?” “Uh…. well I didn't set out to write that, what it turned out to be. I sat down to try and put into words something I had been thinking about.” “Ok, what were you trying to write?” “Uh… so at the end of last session, I said [insert a slightly confused and jarbled retelling of the conversation], and I think up till then I'd felt like you were kind of neutral on what went on in my childhood. Like, maybe those things happened but they probably weren't really a big deal. But when you said what you said, I felt like you were on my side and maybe you did think some of the things that happened were wrong….” I tailed off, and T spoke up “Yes, you're right. I do think some of the things were wrong” “Oh. Um so I was thinking about that and trying to put into words something about, uh, so I see families and children who come into foster care, and they generally have similarities in the situations of the families. Like they're often struggling with money, one or both parents not working, relationship breakdown, complicated situations… and things go on at home that I think almost everyone would agree was wrong. And I was thinking I would say it's wrong for those children to be subjected to those things. But it's hard to think that maybe things - not so extreme, but still things - were going on in my family when it was not that sort of situation at all…. So I sat down to write that, but then when I started typing, I wrote that story instead.”

Doc ID: 14956, distribution: 0.03745435144153354 ; We were a bit naughty yesterday and we went to visit d at her university. She was so desperate for us to go and see her and take her out for lunch. We drove there, picked her up, went to a lovely pub for Sunday dinner, then went for a walk in a local park, stopped in a coffee shop and then took her back to her accommodation and came home. It was a bit of a long day out but it was so good to see her and she kept saying how nice it was to do a normal and non-studenty thing, and just walk around a different area and see families doing normal family things. She seems to be much more settled at uni now, starting to find her feet and enjoy her independent living. I'm writing about it here because I can't post it on any other social media, since we were breaking the rules. We left our tier and went to a different level tier which we're not supposed to do. And then we went out for a meal (and later a coffee) and said we were all one household, which strictly speaking we currently are not, because d is in a household with her student flat. To order in the pub, I had to create an account on their app, which I had to invent a local postcode for. I couldn't use d's postcode because it's for a student flat so evidently not a family home. So much deceit. I feel very guilty. This aspect of the rules is very difficult for me, the way it divides students from their families. I just cannot get my head round my child who is only just over  no longer being in our household. Especially when come Christmas she will be back home with us again (so help me, UK government if you change that rule) so is it really that different.  Anyway this is my confession. I think our visit was very important to d and her mental well-being so I don't regret it. Now England is about to go back in to full on lockdown, d may come home again in the next few days and we will be back to being one household again. Or she may decide to stay at university. I don't know yet, I think she will be swayed by what her friends there decide to do. I think it will be possible to get her home in the middle of the lockdown period if she changes her mind so I don't think it's a now-or-never kind of decision.  Oh while I'm confessing, I also let d out of her  day self-isolation period  hours early because she was becoming one with her bed and that wasn't doing her any good either. She had no symptoms so it seemed unlikely she was about to suddenly develop any. Anyway there we are I have off-loaded my conscience. The baby and I are off for one last Covid-secure swim now before the gym shuts again for lockdown. It will probably be our last ever swim together. Bittersweet times.

The week before, therapy had ended in a difficult place because I'd just told T I felt like she was always defending my parents and on their side - and then we ran out of time. So T referred to that first thing in a roundabout way, and I gave her a lopsided smile because we were on the same page. T said “I can see from your smile that you remember what we were talking about. Are you ok to talk about that, or do you have something else to talk about?” I said that I wanted to carry on talking about it.  “Ok, so I know you said that you felt like I am often defending your parents. The dilemma I have is that in any sort of counselling or therapy, it's really important that the client comes to their own conclusions about things - uh I wouldn't have been able to have this conversation with you a few years ago, but I think now we can talk about this?” I nodded. T continued, “So it's been important I let you come to your own conclusions, but maybe you're ready for me to be a bit more honest about my thoughts?” I watched her face carefully. She smiled and said “It depends how brutally honest you want me to be?…. Hmm well, I suppose that's hard for you to answer because you don't know what I'm going to say!…” My first thought was that yes, I wanted to hear her brutally honest opinion, because it's so hard to know what is “normal” or “not normal” when it's just what you've always known. But then I panicked and thought what if her brutally honest opinion is a bit too shocking to hear right now, am I ready for that?, and so I hesitated. I wasn't sure I was ready to hear it all, after all.

I would honestly love to be that person who goes swimming in the freezing cold ocean on the first of January 🙈 And we saw a crazy number of people having the time of their life the other day in their swimming cozzies, I was literally shook!!

-
This was a travel day for us heading North to Pai from Chiang Mai, so whilst we didn't do much exploring, I still had amazing Thai food (not all shown), watched an incredible sunset and this journey along Route  is pretty intense . . . it's an km road with  bends 😅🙈 I didn't feel amazing by the end of it, but I kept my mind occupied by listening to Climate of Change - an Audible original podcast with  episodes all about global climate issues 🌎🌿
-
You guys know I'm always absorbing new information by listening to different podcasts, and Audible is so so good because it has the world's largest selection of titles so there is always something for everyone!! Climate of Change, in particular, is available for you to listen now on Audible and I've found it to be a really inspiring and grounding series will lots of current information and opinions centred on tackling the climate crisis. I especially love podcasts that interview guests, and this one brings loads of stories to life, including those from Prince William himself 👌🏻
-
These travel days getting from A to B are definitely the less glamorous sides to backpacking, but it's all part of the big adventure and one of the best things about travelling is that every day is *completely* different 🤩 Shoutout again to @audible_UK for working with me on this post, and definitely follow along for more of Holly in Thailand . . . with Matthew, of course, almost always sleeping 😂

-
Before I arrived in Australia, this was one of my biggest worries on my itinerary. And that might sound surprising, but it was because the thought of going on an unguided -day road trip with people I'd only just met really made me feel quite anxious. And because the trip hadn't been booked in advance, unlike the rest of my travels, I was just getting super stressed (Darryl, you'll know 😅).
-
When I then arrived and completed my first tour with Welcome to Travel, of course the homesickness hit with full force and I did feel really overwhelmed. It has also taken time to settle down a bit too. Hence, I felt a lot more comfortable booking a guided tour. I did the -day trip with Wildlife Tours, which takes you all along the 'greatest ocean road in the world' (can confirm, the scenery and landscapes are amazing!) and then into the Grampians. It totally exceeded my expectations and I met some incredible people: definitely people I'd now call friends 🙌🏻
-
I am trying to make sure that I include all my first impressions, thoughts, feelings, worries and anxieties in my vlog series, because I think it's really important to just show you that I am a real person. I struggle a lot in social situations, especially in novel contexts, and solo travelling in really pushing me out of my comfort zone. I am also doing a lot of things for the first time, which is craZy 😬 ... and a lot of them are honestly CRAZY things that I never, ever, thought I'd do 🙈

This week has been super busy, the usual (💁🏻‍♀️), but also very social, not the usual for me
... and I'm loving it! As soon as I stepped off the plane arriving back in the UK, I said to myself that I didn't want to let go of the person I'd found in Australia: the new habits, mindset changes and little growth in confidence. So far it's been pretty successful. In fact, even people who knew me semi-well before as well as strangers (😱) have noticed a change, which is crazy.

So yes, that's going well. And I'm working on a healthy balance between work life, socialising, food and exercise (today's vlog @ pm ✌🏻). But reality check, settling back into home life hasn't been all “too easy” as my Aussie friends would say.

-
So we flew into Bangkok and had to quarantine (on the Test & Go scheme) in the city at the very start of our trip. In all honesty, we did very little exploring, Matthew didn't have his luggage, and so our first impressions weren't great 😕 We also stayed near Khao San Road, which is a lively backpacker hub, but we just didn't really vibe with it!
-
However, staying in Siam at the very end of our trip *completely* changed our opinion of the capital city. Here are some of our highlights and recommendations:
-
🇹🇭 Siam is a shopping district so you have loads of shopping malls, souvenir shops and outdoor markets 👌🏻 You can pay by card in more places here too to save your cash, and it's also only a  minute drive to the international airport, BKK!
-
🇹🇭 We stayed with @lubdbangkoksiam (#prinvite) and I couldn't recommend these hostels enough!!! I do have a discount code for you guys too, getting you % off with the code HOLLY 🫶🏻
-
🇹🇭 For my foodies !!! 😉 If you're vegan or not, please try @veganerie!!! It's in the Siam Center and oh my goodness the menu is insanely good 😍 I also wanted to try Talalaks, again in the Siam Center, but I realised that there are loads of vegan spots in Siam (look on @happycow) 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 If you want a temporary tattoo to prank your parents go to @airydolly 😏 It's on the upper floor of a building with a restaurant underneath (it's easy to miss)!
-
🇹🇭 We stumbled upon the Tropical Fruit Market, which only runs temporarily and has finished now 😭 But I think it might be an annual thing? I'm not too sure on that one you guys, but it was AMAZINGGGGG nonetheless 🤩
-
🇹🇭 To get around definitely use @grabth (basically Uber in Thailand)! You pay by card on the app and you'll pay a set price!
-
There are lots of other tourist things to do in the area, but we just didn't have enough time really! Remember to SAVE this post for later, and if you like these little summaries of the different places we visited then I'll definitely make more (and I also have a camera roll filled with loads of pics to share too 😉) 💚✨

I knew it would be worth the wait, I mean, I've been wanting to travel ever since I got home from Australia because the 'travel bug' really *is* a thing 🙈 I cannot put into words how travelling makes me feel, but it's the spontaneity, the freedom that comes with exploration, the new food, new smells, conversations with people you meet . . . everything is so so special ✨

Aside from Matthew's luggage situation, I was able to throw myself into it all from day one, and as the brother-sister pair that we are (not a couple, as a few people have already thought 😂), we're making some pretty cool memories together 😉

-
To be honest with you, I don't really know the answer to this question myself. What's your favourite season? And let me know WHY down below.
-
You see, I love the summer evenings because the air is still warm and it doesn't get dark very early at all in the UK. The colours of autumn are what sell it for me, but the many . . . many grey skies seem to put a downer on it. Yes, the sound of rain is perfectly tranquil indoors. But your key word there is IN. DOORS. Being out in the rain is not for me (unless I'm dancing in it ok 😏).

The best part of winter is obviously Christmas but you know, I did love celebrating in the heat last year down under. Very strange, but swimming on the th? Yes 👏🏻 please 👏🏻

We don't often get snow in the UK. And I think I've lived to see one white Christmas at a push 🤨 ? The snow for sure looks lovely but wow it freezes my butt cheeks off, and I mean from New Year onwards the cold weather just seems to draggggggg.
-
Spring. Well, spring I think of flowers. It's a pretty optimistic time because you know summer is next but hello, hello, yes I'm British. I complain about the weather  days a year so if I'm not liking the cold, I won't be liking it when it's too hot soon either!!! 😅You cannot win with British people I'm afraid.

p.s. the pink drink is @ausnaturalcare cranberry collagen 😍 #ancpartner 
 
I like the person I am right now, but I'm always learning & constantly growing as a person. So when I think about who I am now & the person I most want to be, I know the only way I can become that person is by getting out of my comfort zone! That's where the magic happens! 💫

The person I most want to be is confident, spontaneous, independent, looks after herself, puts her health first, lives in the moment, positively impacts others, makes friends with strangers, can handle awkwardness & doesn't rely on others to do all the things that bring her joy. 

Who do you want to be? & where would you take yourself on a solo date??? Lmk below 🦋

These are some of the solo dates I've taken myself on: 
🛁 a bath, Netflix, a healthy drink & some snacks at home
☕️ solo coffee date (many of these)
🍿 arcade & movie date 
☀️ sunrise with a book on the lakeside
📚 a day at the library 
🏃🏻‍♀️ a hike
🎢 & fast forward to this week, where for the first time in my life, I went to a theme park on my own. Watch the video in this post to see how it went 🤩

Embrace your solitude. Allow yourself to recharge. Do something NEW. Get in touch with your emotions. Have a break from trying to make others happy & start focusing on what makes YOU happy! ⚡️

To me, romanticising your life isn't looking for the perfect moments in your life, it's about embracing & finding the beauty in all the little moments. It's about appreciating the now, instead of constantly looking to the future or living in the past.

Be intentional.
Be thoughtful.
Be there for yourself.

Oftentimes, life can feel so structured. It makes it difficult to really be present in every moment. We all have our own routines which can become so monotonous, we almost live on autopilot. The hours slip by without us feeling all the beautiful moments in between.

I feel like dating myself has brought me back to those moments where you just fall in love with being alive & all the outside noise just kind of melts away. 

Prioritising your happiness & showing yourself love IS NOT selfish… It's necessary. It's empowering. FILL YOUR CUP, so that you can thrive, while continuing to pour your energy into all of the other small, mundane, beautiful moments in your life 🌈

What kind of things fill your cup??? ☕️ I'd love to hear it, no matter how exciting or mundane it is!! It might give someone else some ideas for ways they can fill theirs as they scroll through💡

These shorts honestly give me life and I cannot wait to put them back on again. All I need is a bit of a glow to go with them, but even without, I'm sure I'll be beaming. Speaking of tans, I do actually STILL have an awful tan line on my legs. I wore shorts pretty much every day on the other side of the globe, so it's not that surprising really, although I'm just amazed at how I've managed to keep hold of it 😅 Congratulations Holly. You're legs still look like drumstick lollipops.

Ok, so whilst that may be an achievement to celebrate, I'm even more proud of running my longest distance ever yesterday!

Highly recommend!! Such a perfect solo date for beginners AND for the experienced 😉

How confident are you to do things solo? Leave a “😥” if you'd get a little (or super) anxious on a solo date & a “😁” if you'd feel confident & comfortable enough to take yourself out on one!! There's no wrong answer btw… It's not for everyone. But you never REALLY know until you give it a try 💛

Taking yourself out on an intentional date is great for: confidence-building, getting to know yourself better, self-sufficiency, personal growth, self love & self care, making new friends, not having to work around other people's schedules & I could go on for YEARS but you get the picture 🥰

Either way, don't forget to make the time for YOU this week… Pencil it in. Your happiness is so important. Self care isn't selfish. In an era of hustle culture, it's NECESSARY to make the time to nurture your mental health, your mind & body. Remember YOU are important too! 🤗

Describe your day in emojis below! Would love to try to guess what you got up to. I hope it was a happy day 🤗✨ 

Here's a lil to-do list when it comes to planning a successful solo date:
• firstly, set yourself up for a happy day: morning skincare [@cerave_aunz ad], yummy breakfast, a bit of movement and/or a plan!! 📆
• put on a cute outfit 💃🏻 
• go somewhere that makes you happy ☀️ 
• do something FOR YOURSELF 🤝
• smile at / speak with strangers 😁
• seek the good in your day - appreciate the sky, the flowers you walk past, the smells, the sounds, the atmosphere, people laughing, working, eating. It doesn't always feel like it, but there's so much beauty out there if we seek it.
🌸 💐 🌸 

Hopefully this encourages you to plan a solo date! I get it, dating yourself sounds weird. I certainly felt weird (and super nervous) at first. Now, I feel like an independent, confident, self-sufficient woman!! 👸🏼 It's one of the best ways to get to know yourself and explore how you feel and act in certain situations, what your drawn to, what you have to offer yourself and others, what you like, what you don't like, the list goes on. I've learned that I'm able to make conversation with strangers, that I can have fun on my own, that I actually don't enjoy water parks, but I LOVE roller coasters and thrill rides. These solo dates have helped me become even more self-aware 🤝

I ALWAYS start my day with my @cerave_aunz AM skincare regime & end with my CeraVe PM skincare regime so I thought I'd share that in today's solo date too ☺️ It's lightweight, fast-absorbing, fragrance-free, paraben-free, non-irritating, gentle on skin and Developed with Dermatologists 🥰 love love love!

Matthew and I also couldn't say no to our £ a night hotel room . . . £ you guys!!! 😱 It had a huge pool, super nice rooms, two gyms and was literally one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in (if you saw the vlogs, you'll know)👌🏻
-
Again, definitely download my itinerary for all the details (linked in my travel planning YouTube video), but these are my top recommendations for Railay 👏🏻
-
🇹🇭 Watch the monkeys!!! Now you can see them in lots of places I believe in Thailand, but there were soooo so many on Railay and they were literally running right beside you 🙈 They're cheeky for sure, but very cute!!!
-
🇹🇭 Railay is known for rock climbing, and even though I didn't book to do it officially whilst we were there, I had to essentially rock climb to get to the lookout point 😆 . . .
-
🇹🇭 The lookout point itself is very easy to miss because there is no path to it . . . as I said, you have to *climb* up 😂 It is a pretty long and steep climb, which Matthew decided not to do, but the view is definitely worth it 🙌🏻
-
🇹🇭 Once you've made it to the viewpoint, you can also visit the lagoon by climbing *down* a super steep cliff face . . . but sadly I can't tell you what this is like because I decided not to do it! I was on my own and looking down didn't make me feel so great 😅
-
🇹🇭 I don't actually have any food recommendations for Railay, just because the spring rolls I had were a bit disappointing 🤨 There were places with vegan options, but I just didn't pick the right place apparently!!
-
Overall, Railay was definitely one of the most beautiful places we visited in Thailand for me, especially in the south of the country 😍 Please please visit 💚✨

They are still craaaaaaazy lunatics that charge around the garden and struggle to stay sitting down when waiting for a biscuit 😂 Even though they do look a lot different, I can still easily tell them apart and so now, here is the test for you guys 😏 Let's see how well you know them shall we? Who is sitting on the left and who is on the right? 🐾 Comment down below go go go 😉 If you followed me in the summer you may remember I gave you some clues in a post on my Instagram and in a YouTube video 🤔 I will also post some extra pictures and videos on my story today to help you out ✌🏻The answer will be revealed tomorrow 🤗

-
First of all, we're only had one person recognise us as siblings . . . and it was in a club 😂 Everyone else, as I said before, thinks we're a “cute” couple OR twins!!! To be honest, I didn't think we looked that alike 🤨
-
Matthew and I are also very quickly learning a lot about each other 😅 I'm very chaotic in the moment, but I'm organised when I need to be and make sure we're on it with planning our new few days ahead. I have no patience when I'm on the hunt for food (#hanger lol) and Matthew basically pulls me across the busy roads here in Thailand 🇹🇭
-
Matthew, on the other hand, will spend ages getting his perfect scenic shots and definitely takes his sweet time getting ready (it's sometimes painful to watch 🤦🏻‍♀️). Hangry Holly and slow Matthew is not a good combination let me tell you that 😂 He'll video every single dog he sees because he loves them, and he now understands what happens when you drink too much alcohol in one night (if you saw the last vlog you'll know) 😬🍺
-
Until I travel solo again, I won't be able to judge why I haven't felt homesick this time. However, I definitely feel like having Matthew with me has meant I've felt safer and more comfortable doing things I wouldn't on my own, like going out after sunset for example, or CLUBBING 🙈 It's also really fun having him here to help get lots of pictures 😉 Matthew prefers me getting 'in the moment' shots for him, as a happy, smiley 'posed' shot is just not his vibe!!

I now sincerely apologise for every single complaint I've made about the UK cold weather because that sounds quite nice to me right now!!

This is a little dump from our flight and first half day in Bangkok after we were released from quarantine👌🏻 Vlog number one (leaving home and arriving in the city) will also be out very soon, as I wanted to post my packing video first, but I've been very quiet on here because (a) I still can't get my head around the time difference 🤦🏻‍♀️😅 and (b) there has been a pretty big disaster 😬 I feel so so bad for Matthew right now and the problem is ongoing, which has been stressful and it's meant we're both not fully able to enjoy the trip sadly 😢

It's a strange world to be living in right now, but the future is still ahead of us. We can only stay optimistic and lift each other up, because during uncertain times of self-isolation and social distancing, our mental health could potentially suffer.

Personally, I still want to pursue a master's, run a half marathon, move out and travel ... resume #hollygoessolo 😏🌎 I'm definitely going to be making a list of my next top destinations, including returning to Australia, but obviously I can only make official bookings when the world is safe again to explore as a backpacker.
-
And I did really take to the backpacker life after I found my feet (... quite literally after putting on my heavy backpack lol 😂). I also promised before I left last year to review my @ospreyeurope bags, which as I said at the time, were very kindly gifted. I was sent the Daylite and the Fairview Trek , which is specifically designed for females.
-
Despite my day bag being eaten into (still a mystery to this day 😂) they are still in such good condition. Obviously they're a bit dirty, but they are incredibly robust and both were just the perfect size. They also have so many compartments to organise all your essentials (and the extra *stuff* 😉), and are fully adjustable ... if you do it correctly!
-
I could say more, but in summary I % recommend both bags. If you are looking to get one because you're considering travelling (...one day) then definitely check out Osprey👌🏻

First Australia, then Thailand, a short trip to Edinburgh and now finally on to exploring Germany (and elsewhere 👀) . . . I think it's safe to say that travelling has taught me so so much and I definitely think you can see how much I've changed (in a good way, of course 😉). I also think it's . . . cheesy . . . but also ok for me to say that I am really proud of myself for coming a pretty long way 😇🙌🏻
-
I will forever be grateful for travelling, which has given me space to not only create the best memories through seeing new places, but also truly find confidence in who I am and just live more freely. We apparently had a colourful itinerary for  weeks in Germany, but now I'm here for an extra week and I don't even know which country I'm leaving to fly home . . .
-
 years ago I would never have done anything like this. It wouldn't have been on the to-do list. Not boarding a flight and losing money would have been a definite no no, and backpacking with friends I've met whilst travelling would have never. even. crossed. my. mind!!!

i know it may seem a little odd to say, but here's a reminder that we are allowed to feel JOY and experience HAPPINESS. even among grief and sadness, even if we aren't where we want to be, even if nothing “special” is going on, there is space for joy, and it is a gift that is too precious not to treasure and hold onto.

this week is filled with a lot of different feelings and emotions, and everyone's holiday week may vary drastically. please please pleaseeee remember that there is room for all feelings and to be kind to yourself and those around you.

We spent quite a few days here on Koh Lanta because the island was such a vibe with amazing vegan food spots, it was perfect for exploring on scooters as newbie riders . . . aaaaand we were both exhausted and a bit ill (updates in vlog, episode ) 😅 It also meant I could finish the Climate of Change podcast, which I'd been listening to on my travels in Thailand as you guys know 👌🏻
-
Especially in the developed world, it can be all too easy to gloss over the realities of climate change because we aren't (yet!!!) feeling the effects, unlike other parts of the world with less money, resources and knowledge. Listening to podcasts like this, however, always sparks me to use my voice and this platform to talk about things I feel very strongly about.
-
From learning about the use of drones to improve the efficiency of power lines to looking at how we can 'gamify' energy saving behaviours, I've really loved the  episodes!! It's been filled with really insightful interviews, incredibly cool music by Imogen Heap and biologist, Dan O'Neill, and very current facts and statistics. Apparently %, I repeat *seventy-percent*, of teenage girls are ashamed of wearing the same clothes again !!! 😳 Please please please, for me and the planet, love and wear your clothes over and over again 🙏🏻 The world of Instagram needs to see it!

One of the best things about solo travel and doing things alone is that you can choose *exactly* what you want to do, when you do it and how you do it. Finding freedom and joy in your own company is one of the most incredible things, and I want you guys to find that too!

Whilst I have always been quite a lone wolf we could say, it's only been recently when I've truly started to enjoy doing things simply by myself . . . and for nobody else but myself.

You've heard me talk about relationship-sy things (and this shook me the most ngl 😳), my weight, body image, feeling confined at home, loneliness etc etc etc... and for me personally, no matter what the topic, I just think it's honestly crazy how much solo travelling has made me realise and come to terms with.
-
On top of that, I've kind of found myself going solo here in Australia by accident. I grew up with homesickness and always wanted to live my life in the UK. I could 'experience' the world through pictures or videos online, which I was perfectly happy with 🤷🏻‍♀️ And even when I found the slightest ounce of motivation to actually go and see some incredible places by myself, I always planned to do it with my dude, @lemonem_ily. We would travel as a duo and Australia had always been top of our list (for a reason I don't even know myself ... Australia just seemed cool 😂).

Ok so fast forward  years of studying at uni: I graduated last year, was lucky enough to go to New York post exams, surf and do yoga for  days in France and complete my first intro dive in Greece on a family holiday. Exploring new places seemed pretty fun, you know. But here's the thing. Em has a full-time job that I know she loves. She's the best person for the role, I think anyway (🙃), and I couldn't be happier for her. I'd never want to see her leave just for me, and so that's when I was like, you know what, yo-freaking-lo ... let's commence #hollygoessolo 😅 (in all honesty, I named the series after the first episode.

🌟 SOLO DATE DIARY # 🌟 

The reason I started taking myself on these solo date adventures is because I'd always lacked confidence. I was the -year-old without a license or job, relying on my mum to make doctor's appointments for me because I was too afraid to make a phone call. But I knew that version of me was being held back by my fears… So now, at , I've decided to start dating myself. It was my way of pushing myself out of my comfort zone and into situations I'd usually avoid, to prove that . I can enjoy my own company and . I WILL grow into my happiest, most confident self 🤝

Remember, the person you want to be is already within you, otherwise you wouldn't want to be that person. The person I AM is confident, kind, spontaneous, motivated, compassionate, isn't afraid to order what she actually wants to eat off the menu, makes friends with strangers, doesn't care what people “might be thinking of her”, she can handle awkwardness & she's proud of who she is! 💪🏼 

In the past I've taken myself to a theme park, the cinema, the arcade, random cafes, the beach, sunrises on the lake, the library & so on… Ahhh, there's so much fun to be had in your own company 🤩 would anyone want SOLO DATE DIARIES to become a thing where I take you along each time? Leave a “👏🏻👏🏻” if so!

The whole reason I started taking myself on dates was to overcome my fears and build confidence… So why was I so afraid to go skating on my own? Was I afraid I'd fall over in front of strangers? That they'd judge me for being on my own? That I'd be the only adult still holding on to the safety bars around the rink? SO WHAT?! 

The fear of failure, of not fitting in, of being judged by others will ALWAYS hold us back, until we challenge ourselves to step outside of our comfort zone and ignore all of the outside noise.

I had the BEST time. I fell over. I laughed at myself. I practised and improved my skating. I made some friends. I complimented a talented stranger. It was a good time!!

I also took myself out to get some food afterwards — I tried a matcha latte & almond croissant for the first time & rated them both in this vid!

Then I pampered myself at @hausofhoneyofficial with a lash & brow glowup!! Yes I did indeed drive . hours for my appointment, because Maddie (owner of Haus of Honey) is the best in the biz! 😍 See the before & after at the end of this video 🙈

Overall, it was an absolute / day!!! A memory I never would've made if I let fear get in the way.

I never actually saw myself as someone who enjoyed hotter weather, sunshine and the beach lifestyle. But I can % say that I'd be in shorts over trackies any day. In Australia I just simply got used to putting suncream on every day and by the end of my trip it really didn't bother me anymore. I also think that it felt like a different kind of heat to the UK. It's part of the culture there in Australia so the country is prepared for it, whereas on that one day in the UK each year (if we're lucky) when we have a  degrees C heatwave ... everyTHING and everyONE shuts down; we all start complaining; there's no air con; all the Brits go to town on the sun bathing and we burrrrrrrrn like bacon, no word of a lie 😂 Having said all that, I do quite like my beanie at the moment ngl, and it helps to cover up my hair when it's a bit too frizzy for my liking. @narnastore I see potential there…

Aside from the weather, I am definitely finding my feet back home and feeling busier than ever, which I love! Back tutoring, the cat hair is everywhere, I've been catching-up with friends, pulled along by Bali and Java, and I even felt like a student again staying overnight in student accommodation by the @londonistdmc (gifted). Despite being, yes, on the more expensive side, the agency is very well recognised and reviewed by students. If you watched my story yesterday, the en-suite room I was given had everything I needed all-in-one, and Chapter King's Cross also had study areas, a gym, screening room, / reception (so you felt very safe) etc etc etc.

Ok why do I always end up on the subject of weather? Maybe I secretly love it, who knows. But anyway, my words of wisdom for the day as as follows . . .
-
Sometimes and on some days I'm an expert at not caring too much. I couldn't care less if people think I'm strange for not doing anything crazy with my hair everyday and leaving it to frizz out of control. The way I drink 'hot lemon' is how I like it, and I seem to enjoy looking like a moving red traffic light because that's apparently my jam 🚦
-
However, on other days and when my mind only seems to crave negativity, any excuse to feed off the opinions of others is too hard to cast aside. Should I not be drinking brown smoothies? Was @hollygemia a bad idea? I'm , Holly should you be looking for a relationship?
-
Now I haven't got a solution to this. But all I can say is: everyone is different and living their own best life. Something that works for you, will not work for others, and you have to always remind yourself of that. Having put my life online for a good few years now, I've come to accept that people will nick pick at the things you do and question . . . everything! But again here's the reminder: don't waste your time or energy on worrying about what other people think.
-
Sorry for the spiel, but I was having a conversation about this with someone yesterday and I wanted to share some thoughts here. I hope lockdown for those affected isn't so bad so far, and I'll see you all tomorrow in the S-U-Y -I-H M- (play the hangman and you'll get it 😉) 💚

-
I flew home on the th of February  and wow . . . Landing back in the UK, seeing Mum and Dad again in the airport, waking Matthew up in his bed and being reunited with my dude (if you remember the vlog, you'll know 😏) are memories I'll never forget. Ahhh what a journeyyyyy (and I don't even care if that's cheesy) 🌎
-
I also don't know why it's taken me so long to post these pictures!!! I never did it at the time, but my meet-up has also got to be one of the happiest days of my whole entire life!!! I was very very close to calling it off and not doing it, because yes, in all honesty I was SO scared (🙈), but I'm so glad I didn't. And I mean Kez, your Instagram message definitely made me change my mind last-minute 😉
-
Having people that follow your life online and enjoy your content is one amazing thing in itself, but actually meeting you guys in-person, like that blows. my. mind 😩🤩 Whilst I may be an introvert at heart, I was literally able to be myself for a day with friends from the Internet that know me, vibe with me, and just simply get me. Like I'm a strange, crazy character as we know, but that's just what you get both on, and off-camera 🙃
-
From casual chats in a library to public photoshoots, sharing dips for chips (yes, we were immediately all very close when I decided to double dunk oops 😂😅) to watching me lick a plate of chocolate clean, this day will always have a very special place in my heart 💚🌿

I'm so sorry Instagram only lets me post  pictures, but I am going to share some more on my stories too ☺️ And the bigger picture here is that YOU guys are amazing and I never thought I'd have an incredible TEAMMMM, because yes we are a team (🙈), of followers in a small corner of the Internet I can call my own 💫

-
Short answer: YES 🤩 But let's add some context first! So Koh Tao is where most people come to dive in the country. Thailand is also the second cheapest place in the world to dive, so I'd highly recommend you try it if you're travelling in Asia 🌏
-
I did my Open Water qualification in Australia and honestly fell in love with all things scuba diving, the ocean and exploring underwater 🐢 It's not going to be for everyone, just like anything in life (😅), but . . . you'll never know until you try, right?! Scuba diving is also thought of as this very 'high risk' sport. However, that's not actually true. When diving with a reputable company and you remember to simply breath and relax, trust me, you'll have a whale of a time 😉
-
Like my last post about Bangkok, here are some of our top highlights from the island:
-
🇹🇭 The first shoutout goes to Bryan (not Byron lol I'm so sorry) from @lbdivingkohtao who invited both Matthew and I to dive and helped me get my Advanced qualification! We couldn't have asked for a better experience, and I do have a discount code in the description box of episode  if you want % off from me 🤟🏻
-
🇹🇭 Pleaseeee try the food from Big Bite Cafe ✨ The smoothie bowls were amazing and there were lots of other vegan options too 🌱
-
🇹🇭 We stayed at the Fisherman Resort, made loads of cat and dog friends, and the staff here were so incredibly kind 🥰 It's on the beach, the gardens are stunning and they also serve really good food here (try the pineapple fried rice with tofu) 😍🍍
-
🇹🇭 There's a small Japanese place, called Asia Mood I think, which is a  minute walk from the Fisherman Resort, but there are lots of other places to get food nearby. I just hope that as tourism picks back up, the -Eleven right outside the Fisherman opens again because those stores are simply the best for snacks and convenience items!
-
Had we spent more time here, we'd have rented a scooter and explored further than just on foot, but we were really busy, and very happily busy, swimming with the fish over our three days 😆

Travelling alone never fails to push me outside my comfort zone and it means I'm always trying something new. Edinburgh found me waking up in a dorm filled with only guys (*laugh tentatively*🙈😳), asking strangers to take a photo is always slightly awkward but kind of fun at the same time, and whilst it sounds really silly, I would have *never* ever bought myself a bagel out for lunch and enjoyed it by myself in the past!!
-
It's the small achievements like this that really make me realise how far I've come. Re-gaining my confidence has be incredibly challenging, but the one thing that blows my mind is that I seem to be finding it in the places where I would have once felt very lost. In a restaurant alone?! On a -hour overnight coach?! And yes, even on top of an extinct volcano (sounds funny, but it's so true) 😅😂

Tomorrow I'll be posting the second vlog from Edinburgh wooOoOOoo!!! And watch out for a reel sharing all the vegan food I found in the city whilst I was there (trust me it's going to make you hungry 😍)!

AND: what would've happened if I'd accepted my first job offer and started a full-time contract teaching biology in the UK last year? Again, I wouldn't be here travelling and this has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Period.

So I've just finished a tour and again, I'm on a high. Over  days, I explored a new gem of a place here in Australia, met some incredible people from all across the globe, *attempted* to party but actually went to bed at pm (😂) and simply had the best time.

On a more serious note, let's talk about some holiday 'expectations' (and I know we're going out of season now, but I just wanted to share some of my thoughts). This was the first time I'd been away somewhere hot in a looooooong time, and similarly, the first time I'd worn a bikini out in the sun. The summer season, in general, is associated with the hype around getting a 'bikini body', diet fads, having ultra smooth legs or a razor rash-free bikini line. These unspoken expectations are so high, it really can make you feel overwhelmed and a bit self-conscious, and this year I'm not going to lie, these thoughts did get to me. With no to-do lists and nothing to do but relax, negative anxieties got the better of me.
-
If you watched my story and read my posts you'll know that my week in Greece didn't start off too well. But thankfully, I found my way out of the little dark hole I'd created in my mind and things got better. It wasn't easy, but I just had to let go of *my* standards and also no worry about the opinions of others (something I usually don't think twice about).
-
So in short: Yes, my legs are riddled with bruises (from surfing 😂). I refused to de-hair my legs because to be quite honest, I thought it was a waste of my time (🤷🏻‍♀️). Ok I workout my abs, but I've not got a -pack that's 'there' all. the. time. And it's also worth mentioning that my bikini line hates razors (😡) #realities

This is something I never would've done if I'd never started taking myself on solo dates. I adore working with brands who encourage me to step out of my comfort zone & make the time for myself on such an intimate level… Thank you @cerave_aunz!! #AD
 
I read somewhere that “There is a big world out there. Some journeys take you far from where you come from, but closer to where you belong. Don't wait for someone else to take you by the hand… Just go!”
 
And it couldn't be more true. For me, I'm constantly evolving because I put myself in uncomfy situations. Honestly, I was sweating torrential rain from my armpits because I was nervous and I always second guess what I say and if people are vibing me, but at the same time I know that all I can do is be myself, so whether I “fit in” or not doesn't matter. The only person who has to like me is me. I was SO excited to be somewhere new, with new people, embracing a new sense of confidence and learning new things. It's scary, but I no longer let that control my limits or stop me from stepping out of my comfort zone.
 
While I was on this trip, I realised how important my skincare regime has become. It's that dedicated time in the day, morning and night, where I look at myself in the mirror and declare, “I'm going to look after you. It's you & me baby! I care about you & I'm going to put time into you.” which is something a lot of us don't do and often times something we avoid.
 
I'm so glad I'm prioritising a few minutes every day to take care of my skin & body, inside & out. I know future me will thank me for it!!! Currently, this is my skincare regime:
 AM: Skin Renewing Vitamin C Serum + AM Facial Moisturising Lotion with SPF
PM: Skin Renewing Retinol Serum + Skin Renewing Night Cream, all from @cerave_aunz 
 
Keeping in mind it does change every now & then depending on my lifestyle & how busy I am. If I have more time, I will include other products :)
 
Hope this inspires you to make time for you & give yourself love <

Happy Real Me Monday ✨ FITTING ROOM ✨ edition ⤵️

A “bad body image day” can be triggered by many things… Sometimes it's seeing yourself in the mirror, sometimes it's sizing up or down in clothes, sometimes it's comparing yourself to others... Just to name a few. 

But a lot of the time, what you see doesn't reflect the reality of the situation. Whether that's in the mirror, trying on clothes or seeing photos online.

. We are all our own harshest critics 
. You've only ever seen yourself in the mirror or in photos, so you will never actually see your true beauty. 
. Lighting, angles, posing, different lenses & mirrors can change the way we look — especially in fitting rooms. Some stores use mirror manipulation or softer lighting to hide lumps & bumps. Some stores use wide mirrors or harsh lighting which cast shadows over your body & exaggerate every feature... But in case you were wondering, there is nothing wrong with having lumps & bumps!!
. Sizing differs so much 😅 I size up & down depending on the store or fit! 🤯 (P.s. sizing up or down depending on the way your body changes over time is PERFECTLY OKAY too!!!)🌻

“🙋” in the comments if you've experienced any of this before!

You are not your size. You are not your appearance. There is so much more to you than that 💗

Remember, a bad body image MOMENT doesn't have to turn into a bad body image DAY. Acknowledge the way you're speaking to yourself, take a deep breath & consciously try to switch to more gentle thoughts!!

Please be kinder to yourself, at all times, because you never know what external (or internal) factors are at play… Your body & appearance really is the least interesting thing about you 💛

P.s. for those asking, my hair was done recently by @_edwardsandco — we went a lil bit darker & I'm loving it!! 🫶

Are you forever worshipping bodies that aren't yours?

I used to. But this is why comparing your body to someone else's sets you up for failure… 

Having other people as your body goals can actually cause more harm than good. Because it's VERY likely they:
-are a different height to you
-have a different bone structure 
-have different genetics
-have different body proportions (longer legs, wider hips, longer torso, wider ribs, broader shoulders, etc)
-lead different lifestyles / have different habits to you 
-have different energy needs
-have a completely different body composition 
-don't share what they look like / so you likely only see them at their “best”
-probably post posed & flattering photos for social media
-have similar, very normal, HUMAN features to you, such as: cellulite, fat, rolls, body hair, acne, etc but maybe they don't show it
-possibly even edit their photos before posting
+ their body might've been achieved by doing things that you simply can't sustain long-term while being your healthiest & happiest self

So, please try not to treat yourself unkindly because you don't look like her/them. You are uniquely you!! 

IMO your best body is whichever one you're living in when you're living your most authentic, balanced life with habits that make you happy inside & out! It's really more about how you FEEL, not how you look.

I didn't always think about it this way though. But I once heard a saying “You are always most powerfully positioned to serve the person you once were” so I suppose the reason I share these kind of posts now is because it's what I wish I saw more of in the past & I believe it would've helped. So I hope it helps just one person be kinder to themselves today 🦋

Happy Real Me Monday! 💐

Doc ID: 2597, distribution: 1.0 ; COMPARISON IS THE THIEF OF JOY 😅

So how do we stop giving it the power to stop us from feeling ✨ good ✨ ???

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love social media — but it can be a black hole full of people sharing their best life & best versions of themselves, so it makes sense that we'll find ourselves comparing our own lives & bodies while scrolling through. 

Here are some things that helped me stop comparing myself to others:

🦋 Her/his beauty and/or success doesn't take away from yours
🦋 A flaw is something that mars/weakens a subject - does your cellulite weaken you? Nope!!
🦋 Perfection is an illusion - we only see what someone wants us to see. The photos that are posted are only % of someone's life. There are  hours in each day, and we usually only see a few minutes of someone's life online so we really are blind to the real challenges people face every day.
🦋 Bad body image days happen to us all — so if you think weight loss or a makeover is going to magically fix that, you're in for a shock 🙈 finding peace with your body and appearance happens when you start working from the inside out (internally / mentally) ✨
🦋 We're all living on a different timeline. Mark Zuckerberg might've created his multi-million dollar company in his dorm room as a teen, but Vera Wang didn't design her first dress until . 
🦋 Beauty is subjective - you might not see your beauty, but you also don't see the way your eyes light up at the sight of puppies or sunsets, so how can you really ever know your true beauty when you've only ever seen yourself in a mirror or in photos?
🦋 Some things can't be changed - you want to be younger??? That's just not possible, so why dwell on it? Right now is the youngest you'll ever be ever again, so enjoy it! 🙈

I really don't know if this will help… But I thought I'd share a few things that helped me 🥰 

Do you find yourself comparing to others? And if so, does it tend to be comparing their physical appearance to yours OR their life / successes to yours??? Let's talk about it ✨

Doc ID: 2402, distribution: 0.21754603864405195 ; Obvious ➡️ subtle ➡️ real. Editing isn't always noticeable. Not everything you see is real. 

I probably could've posted the first two images side-by-side & claimed one was edited & one wasn't… without ever really putting my true unedited, tired-looking self out there for almost k people to see. Would you have been able to tell?

That's how subtle & realistic some edits can be.

In this culture we're so driven to validate our existence by impressing others. By trying to make ourself successful or attractive by the standards that are laid down for us by external forces & have nothing to do with our real needs or who we actually are as human beings. It's almost impossible not to fall into that trap. We're then validated that we're doing the right thing or look the right way… by abandoning our true selves.

In an era of social media, comparison, editing apps & ever-changing diets & beauty fads, you can either:
~ follow the trends & try to fit the mould (but inevitably never feel satisfied or good enough)
~ be yourself, be kind to yourself & be the change you wish to see in the world 🌻 

The more we see it, the more we normalise it. This means the more we see “perfected” photos, the more we normalise that. But the more we see REAL, flawed, normal photos, the more we normalise that & the more others will feel comfortable to show up that way too. You decide which one you take part in & normalise. 

At the end of the day, all I hope for is that you will realise your self-worth isn't tied up in other people's opinions of you… It's about what YOU think of you. And if you're having a hard time liking yourself, I promise it doesn't have to be that way — let's work on being kinder to ourselves TOGETHER 🤝

And remember, you'll never really know if someone has or hasn't edited a photo or tweaked it in some way. This is why it's so important to scroll with caution & not compare yourself to people online 🙅🏻‍♀️🚨

just because you don't love your body doesn't mean you have to fight against it. here are things you can work on:

- choosing to accept your body no matter how it changes, fluctuates, or appears
- finding things to appreciate about your body like how much it allows you to do and how it's just trying to take care of you
- not giving the harmful thoughts the attention they want and not allowing them to control your actions
- questioning your harmful thoughts and asking yourself where they came from
- saying kind things to your body and repeating positive mantras that resonate with you
- taking care of your body and honoring your body's needs and desires even when you might not want to

hating your body doesn't do anything except make your body a harder place to exist in, so when “body love” feels out of reach, try body acceptance, body appreciation, body peace, body neutrality, body kindness, and body respect instead.

When you start being kinder to your body & appreciate its uniqueness, the stretch marks that prove your growth, the way your body heals whenever you're hurt, the way your smile can cause a snowball effect of smiles, the way your legs take you anywhere you need, the way your eyes allow you to see colour & your skin allows you to feel the warmth of being held. When you start looking at things through a different lens, you start SEEING the world (& yourself) differently…
 
You might realise there's actually nothing wrong with the tummy rolls the world has taught you to feel ashamed of. Your focus might transform from punishment to nourishment. When you realise that the standard of beauty you've followed since you were young is not all that realistic, you might start to appreciate what you have a lil more. When you stop comparing yourself to strangers on the internet, you might find that their beauty isn't your lack & that maybe, you're only seeing what society deems “Insta-worthy” or aesthetic or beautiful, but most of the time they look & feel the same way you do when they're scrolling through socials too.

For e.g: in the st photo, I used to believe the left made a “good” photo & the right made a “bad” one. The only difference is that I'm flexing / posing in one & relaxing in the other. But now that I've STOPPED viewing myself through the lens that media, society & the mainstream standard of beauty had brainwashed me with, I can see the beauty in both. Both are healthy, both are confident, both are THE SAME BODY. So it's hardly fair to accept one & not the other.

I know I can only represent what I have, but the same thing applies for everyone across the board. If being mean to yourself worked, it would've worked by now. Try being kind to yourself & see what happens 💫

Just because you appreciate one, doesn't mean you can't appreciate the other. And it's the same deal for each and every one of us. Despite what we've been brought up to believe, there's not just one type of beautiful. 

Happy Real Me Monday! I know that today could be the day you decide to kickstart your health journey to reach your “body goals” after a weekend of simply ✨ ENJOYING YO LIFE ✨ and there's nothing wrong with working on yourself, but I'll just leave this here every Monday to remind you that a woman who works out regularly, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle can have belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, and doesn't always look as toned and fit as she may appear online. So next time you question your self-worth when comparing yourself to someone you idolise online, remember this:

If we base our self-worth on something as ever-changing as our bodies, we will forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession and shame. 

So I hope these weekly doses of reality help with that. The more we see normal women with normal bodies, the more realistic our expectations will be, and then hopefully more of us will start to accept ourselves too 💛

You cannot judge, shame & criticise yourself into a person that loves themselves. Trust me, I've been there. Diet after diet, picking myself apart, editing my photos, punishing myself… It's just not possible.

If your body was invisible & the world could only see you for your heart & soul, would you live life differently? Would you go out more, say yes to lunch with friends, go on more dates, enjoy more cake on your bday, be happier? If you answered yes to any of these, leave a “🙋‍♀️” in the comments! Perhaps it's a sign you truly want to do more of those things & stop allowing your body image to hold you back.

In order to begin the process of love, we have to practice being able to catch the negative self-talk as it happens & shift it to a kinder, more accepting thought.

Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. It's all in the mind. When we think negatively of ourselves, we often say it as if it's just a fact or part of our identity, like “I'm gross, flabby, ugly, too lazy, impatient, not smart enough” 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 etc. So yes, if we tell ourselves that every single day, then that's the reality we'll create. That's the mentality we're taking on, that's how we'll view ourselves, that's what our brain will be searching to confirm every time we mess up or see our reflections in the mirror. 

But if we start to tell ourselves things like “I have a healthy body, I'm a good person, my life is purposeful, I'm in control of my day, I give myself compassion” 🙌🏼😍👏🏻 etc then THAT is the reality we're creating 🌈 

A positive mind holds more power than we give it credit for. And no, this definitely won't come naturally at first, in fact it'll feel super weird (it did for me too) because we're so used to being so hard on ourselves, but as my boyfriend has told me before: There's a huge difference between “I made a mistake” & “I am a mistake”

Happy Real Me Monday, here's a dose of reality for your feed to kickstart your week with kindness! Let's make it a FABULOUS one! 💛

Around % of the Instagram posts you see are a highlight reel full of people's best moments, so it's easy to assume the bodies you see online always look perfect... But sucking in & tensing your body can change your entire shape. It's easy to compare your reflection to someone else's best photo... But please remember, NO ONE is perfect! If you walked past me sitting down at the beach, chances are you'd see my body the way it looks on the right... Not the left. We ALL look different when we pose our bodies for a photo, but that doesn't mean the natural versions of ourselves are something to be ashamed of! ✨

I'm LOVING how realistic and open people are becoming on Instagram... I love seeing other people post 'less flattering' and more realistic versions on themselves. I feel like I've started to really heal my relationship with my own body image from seeing them and posting my own on my page... The more I share the real version of myself on here, the less I feel the need to hide or water-down those versions of myself in the real world 👏🏻

I also frequently get asked how I managed to lose kgs without getting loose skin... But this photo also showcases that I still do have some loose skin! It's definitely firmed up over time due to staying active & living a healthy lifestyle, but loose skin isn't something that will go away over night, it takes months and sometimes years for your skin to become firm again. In the meantime, I won't be trying magic creams or firming agents to 'fix' it, I'll just continue to appreciate my body and stay active. Be patient with your body, it can do some pretty amazing things! ✨

Doc ID: 2420, distribution: 0.7618832639421619 ; Not all “glow ups” include losing kgs. Sometimes the glow up is losing the weight of the unrealistic & unhealthy expectations you have of yourself. Sometimes it's letting go of society's standard of beauty. Sometimes it's making peace with your reflection & learning that the healthiest, happiest version of you may not be the smallest & that's more than okay! 🫶

… Sometimes it's being able to walk into a store, try on a bikini, embrace the dimples, lumps, bumps, bloating & softness in the reflection with a smile on your face, because all you see is a body being a body 🎉

You might feel like it isn't possible to be truly happy in your skin, but I'm just leaving this here to remind you that it is & that smaller doesn't always equal happier & it IS possible to no longer be consumed by unkind thoughts towards yourself! 

In the last photo, I was at a point in my life where I used to take photos of my body every morning to track any small body changes & you'd NEVER find me without my Fitbit on, but you can see in my face that everything at that time was about my body, not my happiness… 

Life is soooo much fuller & lighter when you let go of the unrealistic expectations you've been carrying on your shoulders all your life. One day at a time, reminders like these will slowly chip away & in a year from now, you will notice the little changes in your mindset towards yourself, your body & food. Small steps every day = big changes. THAT'S called growth 💪

Swipe for a surprise HAHA happy real me Monday! Thanks for being here as I kickstart each week with a dose of reality 🌈

These photos are here because I want you to SEE that the things you wish away from your body don't actually have an impact on your worth or value & as much as you don't see it in yourself, these parts of you can be beautiful. Sometimes we just need to see things through a different lens. Have you been hard on yourself lately? If you have, leave a '🙋‍♀️' in the comments... This is for you: YOU ARE AMAZING. Believe that & embody that. The way you speak to yourself matters!

Fun fact: I used to delete all of the natural, candid, relaxed photos like the ones on the right straight away & tbh just seeing myself that way would've ruined my whole day, even some of the photos on the left would've been deleted too, because I was sooo overly critical of myself & which version of me should be showcased on social media. 

Now? Those are my favourite kind of photos. They're ME at my most vulnerable, when I'm having fun, when I'm relaxed, when I'm really enjoying my life. These are the moments I'll look back on with a smile. None of my best moments & favourite memories happen when I'm holding my breath & tensing so hard I could poop myself 💩 

These photos are the ones that make me feel happy & they're also the ones that don't make others feel worse about themselves. It's a win win 🎉 

There is SO much more to life than comparing, punishing yourself, picking yourself apart, sweating the small stuff, caring more about what others *MIGHT* think of you rather than prioritising how you WANT to live your life & how you actually FEEL about yourself. 

So ask yourself right now: 
. What's important to me? 
. How do I want to live my life? 
. I can either view myself through a negative lens or a positive one, which lens am I going to start choosing?

Well… This is kinda different for me 🙈 but I thought I'd bring my two worlds together: singing AND body image (thanks to “Jealousy Jealousy” by @oliviarodrigo) & since some of you won't even know I like to sing… SURPRISE! 😬 

How many of you have felt jealous while admiring another person's beauty? How many of us scroll through social media and feel worse, or behind, or less beautiful, or less competent, or less successful afterwards? Leave a lil “🙋‍♀️” in the comments if you have.

Around % of people feel jealous regularly & that's why it's so so important to remember that we are all uniquely made & not everything is shared on social media, so comparing someone's online appearance / life / successes isn't a fair comparison. Those imperfections & quirks that you see as your “flaws” are actually the very same qualities that set you apart & make you who you are. 

Let me put it into perspective for you… When I first listened back to this video, I compared my voice to other people's voices & focused on all the little imperfections, just like a lot of us do with our own body / achievements / talents, right? We always put ourselves up against someone we think is better than us, but if we all looked or sounded or were exactly the same as someone else, all those things that make us who we are would cease to exist.

My voice is my voice. Your body is your body. You are uniquely you & there's so much beauty in that.

So tell me, what's one thing you tend to compare to others & wish to become more confident with?

Here's the first step in me overcoming my comparison & lack of confidence with singing = no professional editing, no professional backing track, just one take of me & my keyboard for ,+ people to see 🎹 not gonna lie, I'm nervous… 

Can we also just imagine if Olivia herself actually saw this… 😳 I think I'd simply ✨ combust ✨

For so many of us, we've allowed our harsh views of our body and others' opinions of beauty affect how we live our lives, what we wear, how we carry ourselves, what we can eat, how much we can eat, how we feel about ourselves & we fill our minds with doubtful thoughts. We treat our bodies like a work in progress, a “before” photo that doesn't deserve to be seen.

But a day we turn down doing something that brings us joy is a day of happiness we will NEVER get back. So I encourage you to do something this week you've been holding off on… Maybe it's dining out, or going to the beach, rocking a cute dress, or wearing a bright crop top. What is that thing for you? Lmk below… I'll go first!

Whatever it is, you deserve to enjoy it. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to be comfortably & unapologetically you. Today, tomorrow and every day after that.

Idk about you, but to me, real is beautiful.
Softness is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.

To celebrate  WEEKS of Real Me Monday (+ posed VS unposed photos), I'm banding together with some of the most empowering women on the gram — swipe across to meet them (if you haven't already!) 🦋 

As humans, we all have our own internal monologue that steers towards those unloving thoughts, we all catch ourselves picking at parts of our bodies or comparing ourselves to others... so this post is here to remind you that: 

🌸 people can change the way their bodies look in photos with different clothes, posture, lighting, tensing, sucking in & posing, so comparing your % to the % that someone else posts online is UNFAIR & UNREALISTIC 🌸

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

So don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home, so sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

What's your favourite way to uplift yourself & switch those negative thoughts into positive ones? Lmk in the comments, it could inspire someone else 🧚🏻‍♀️

Happy Real Me Monday! 😌

Monday used to be the day I'd look in the mirror & pick myself apart. I'd be extra harsh on myself for eating more, resting more or simply living my life over the weekend. I'd give into these unobtainable beauty standards & start a miserable diet in order to become: smaller / less this / more that / good enough.

So I'm just leaving this here as a little reminder that your real, unposed, bumpy, dimpled legs, non-flat tummy, juicy bod is absolutely stunning! I'm here to *kindly & gently* slap away those negative thoughts that tell you you should be drastically changing your lifestyle & body today… 

Living a healthy lifestyle & nourishing your body is a YES from me, I'm not saying you shouldn't look after yourself, but hating yourself in the process, setting unrealistic expectations & making unsustainable changes that feel more like punishment is a big NO! 

Resting, eating & having fat on your body is not unhealthy or anything to be ashamed of. In fact, they're all extremely vital for a healthy body. Ok? Got it? Good 😌 

P.s. I'm very aware that my body doesn't represent all body types & shapes, but I'd much prefer to showcase my normalities than portray perfection. I'm hoping that by showing my normal, it'll encourage you to embrace yours, no matter how that looks for you!

Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, so create your own beauty standards! You don't owe anyone their idea of “perfection” & you don't have to pretend you have your shiz together for strangers on the internet. Do you, for you. OK LOVE YOU 💛

Doc ID: 9562, distribution: 0.2367221666753244 ; i get told that my body “looks” “healthy” and “athletic” by family, by friends, and by complete strangers...a lot. i know that they're meant as compliments, but please hear me out.

my body has looked bigger than my current body, smaller than my current body, and similar to my current body, and i've been very unhealthy and less athletic than i am now with all of them.

my body has also looked bigger than my current body and smaller than my current body, and i've been more athletic than i am now with them.

over the past couple years, my body has looked relatively the same, and even then, my health and athleticism has changed throughout.

the point? how my body looks has never been an indicator of my health or athleticism. but, comments about my body and how it looks has previously led me to tie my identity to my body, to restrict myself in order to achieve a look (that was never enough), and to prioritize “looking healthy” over actually being healthy.

i know i have body privilege, and so many people who are also healthy experience weight stigma. even though this is what my healthy recovered body looks like (right now), this is not what your healthy body should look like because all of our healthy bodies are going to look different from one another.

some reminders:
- people of all shapes and sizes can be healthy and athletic. health and athleticism are not a look.
- you can choose to add in health-promoting behaviors to your lifestyle without any focus on your weight.
- we can't dismantle diet culture without addressing weight stigma.
- you are not what other people think of you.
- if we all ate the same things and exercised the same ways, we'd all still have different bodies.
- someone else's body doesn't tell you anything about them.
- there are better compliments than ones about someone's body.
- how we look is one of the least important things about ourselves.

p.s. you are not morally obligated to be healthy or athletic. ALL bodies are good bodies that are deserving of care, love, and respect.

p.p.s. you can live in a privileged body and still struggle with an eating disorder, body image, and negative comments from others about your body.

Doc ID: 2387, distribution: 0.39153894262318323 ; We've all just witnessed the media claim that “heroin chic” is back & curvy bodies are out. But your body isn't a trend. Trends come & go. They change, DRASTICALLY, all the time. But your genetic makeup doesn't.

In  BC, women were considered beautiful for having “fertile” fuller bodies & for what their bodies could do… In , women are losing their periods due to the pressure they feel to eat less & be smaller. 

It scares me to think that I could have an entire social media page full of photos like the ones on the left & use it to sell the idea of that particular body i.e. workout/meal plans, unrealistic body expectations, or endorse products that promise a certain outcome… When truthfully, a healthy & active lifestyle = the body on the right for me & it might look like something COMPLETELY different on anyone else.

Nobody really tells you that even when you're working out & eating balanced meals, you'll still have cellulite, get bloated, have belly fat & belly rolls, stretch marks, loose skin, and all the things that still wobble & squish. Nobody tells you that those things don't need to be fixed because they're all very normal human features (which they are!!) 🫶

For this reason  years ago, these “Real Me Monday” posts were born & my life started to change forever because I realised that body/beauty trends aren't realistic, that confidence & true happiness comes from within & showing up as you are… instead of punishing your body, hiding yourself & changing the external parts of you. 

How do beauty trends make you feel about yourself? Leave a “🌹” if it doesn't impact you in any way & a “🥀” if it leaves you feeling less than/worse about yourself.

In , I hope that beauty can be more inclusive & positive & focus on within, as it should. It starts with us rejecting all the unattainable trends & the narratives that are fed to us by the media & all those who benefit ($) from making us feel bad in our skin… We've got this! ✊

How often do you think kind thoughts when you see your reflection? Would you say you think kind thoughts more often or less often than negative ones? Lmk in the comments 🥺💛

Personally, I'd say I used to tear myself down % more often than I would think positively about myself. Social media didn't help... I wondered why I never saw people with rolls, bloating, cellulite, stretch marks, belly fat, hip dips, “more gut than butt”, back acne, blemishes, small b😮😮bs & 🍑 online like I had.

But it makes sense that I don't see those things online. Most of us are only comfortable sharing our best photos... Think about it, it's rare that you'd willingly post your worst photo & showcase your insecurities, which btw is a totally fair feeling to have & posting a photo you feel great in is not a bad thing!!

But once I realised that, it made me realise how much I would LOVE to see those things being normalised, because if I could see the beauty in someone else who has the same “flaws” as me, maybe then I could see the beauty in myself. So I decided I'd be the change I wanted to see — I could post my reality & perhaps it'd help someone else.

Self-acceptance & thinking positively about myself wasn't something that happened overnight, in fact, when I posted my first RMM post + months ago, I was TERRIFIED!! 😅 but these are some tips that helped:
✨ Curate your feed! Follow people who make you feel good & inspire positivity!
✨ Set realistic expectations. Just because it's not shown online, doesn't mean it's not normal ☺️
✨ The reason “flaws” is in quotation marks is because YOU ARE NOT FLAWED. A flaw is a mark that weakens a substance / object. Does cellulite weaken you? NOPE 🤩
✨ You don't have to LOVE your body, but do try to ACCEPT your body, as it is & for what it does for you. 

You may not realise it, but you guys really encourage me along my own confidence & self-acceptance journey too. You keep me accountable & show me that my voice is heard, which means more than you'll ever know. Thank you 💛

Doc ID: 2542, distribution: 0.18890996072056113 ; Having positive body image isn't believing your body looks good, it's believing your body IS good, regardless of how it looks! ✨

And when you start believing your body *is* good, it makes it a whole lot easier to feel more confident, comfortable & appreciative of that body. 

“But how do I start truly believing my body is good?” you might be wondering…

Well, your mind is a powerful tool. So when you declare something, your brain looks for evidence to confirm it. So if you declare: “I'm not good enough”, your brain is going to seek everything in your life that reinforces that statement. It'll disregard everything that doesn't.

So many of us are feeding our minds negative reinforcement & critical self-talk. But if you just shifted your mindset & put your energy into more positive thoughts instead, that could change your life.

That's why I post this Real Me Monday series every week now, to help kickstart your week with positive affirmations & reminders that: YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!

The next time you speak down to yourself, know that ONLY YOU have the power to give yourself kindness & positivity. Your body image is a reflection of your mindset, it's influenced by what  you believe & all of the messages you tell yourself. Some of those messages will be influenced by external sources like the media, your family, friends etc but it's up to you whether you take those opinions on as your own.

For me, I'm no longer telling myself I'm only beautiful when I'm sucking in, hiding away & portraying perfection. I'm choosing to accept myself as I am & because of that, I'm constantly seeking everything in my life that reinforces that thought, I'm constantly seeking the magic in myself, and I believe it now, my body is good, it keeps me healthy & safe. It's my home 🥺

You have the power, never forget that 💛

But we live in a society that perpetuates such awful beauty standards and ideals that it's almost impossible not to have some issues with your body if you're a woman.   So, real talk, I was going through photos of myself from the NEDA walk today and all I could see was my face: how much I hated how I looked in the pictures other people took. The self-loathing that I've worked so hard to counter came on sudden and strong, reminding me that if I let myself be seen it will always end up like this - that I will never be enough. In that moment I wanted to self-destruct, to punish my own body for not matching my internalized unhealthy expectations.   And let me be clear that it's not that now, a few hours past, I'm suddenly in love with my body. Because I'm not. But I am really angry. I'm angry that some old white dudes who run corporations that perpetuate beauty standards and the diet industry tell me what is or isn't okay. I'm angry that I care. I'm angry that I would ever allow anyone else to control how I feel about myself. I'm angry that I would ever destroy myself, make myself less, hide my body or take up less space in the world to appease someone else. I'm really not down with the idea of anyone who would ask that of me having power in my life.  So here's to being seen, taking up space, and radical self-love. Here's to honoring my body, whatever it may look like and countering the narrative that there is a specific way that is good for bodies to look, one boxed in way that makes you beautiful. (Which - ugh - sounds so freaking cheesy I can hardly stand it, BUT body positivity is actually really important.)  Most importantly, here's to never, ever, giving over my power to anyone else.

So after years of putting myself down, struggling with body image & seeking validation from others, I told myself I was already good enough… & I started carrying out my every day life as if that were so. 

Beauty doesn't have anything to do with the way the world perceives you. Confidence doesn't come from their opinion of you. Let them think what they think. What matters is what you see. Your body is your home. You can decorate it however you like. If you think it's beautiful, that's all that matters.

“Self love” isn't linear, some days we'll feel bleh & other days great, but as long as you're equipped with the mindset & tools to know how to be kinder to yourself, you'll feel confidence in knowing you'll be okay.

The slightest change of thought really can help. Instead of thinking “I feel & look gross today” & letting that one thought dictate my mood for the day, I can turn my thinking around & say “It's just a feeling, not a fact. The way I look is the least interesting thing about me. I might do my hair & make a nice breakfast, that usually makes me feel better.”

That's what this weekly series is for. To remind you not to compare your life or your body to someone on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with yourself as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that.

Happy Real Me Monday ☀️ drop something you're excited about this week in the comments below! Let's hype each other up 🥳 I'll go first…. 👇

💭 going swimming with your friends in the summer because your body was soft & wobbly.
💭 laughing until your cheeks hurt because your teeth weren't perfectly straight.
💭 wearing your fav shorts because you were embarrassed of your cellulite.
💭 sharing candid, real, happy photos of yourself because they “weren't aesthetic or perfect”.
💭 going into stores & trying on clothes without hating what you see staring back at you.
💭 saying yes to invitations & opportunities because you didn't believe you were good enough.
💭 hanging out with your friends in case you didn't live up to their expectations of you.
💭 wearing what you want to wear.
💭 enjoying all the snacks at the sleepover because food made you feel guilty.
💭 saying BYE to diet fads & creating real healthy habits, not restrictive ones. 
💭 living your life completely on your own terms.

Please don't give your looks more power than memories, love & joy. Please stop comparing yourself to others, you are not them, they are not you & your time is far too precious to spend it wishing you were anyone other than your unique self. Don't wait until you can no longer make the change. 

There are no limits or boundaries. You deserve it all. The confidence. The outfits you wanna wear (but tell yourself you “can't”). The acceptance within yourself to embrace who you are & share imperfect photos that are actually perfect because they're the real you. The self love. The life you dream of. 

The good news is, you can still go swimming, laugh with your friends, say yes to invitations, wear the shorts, eat the burger, go on dates, post the photo & embrace what you've got! As you are, right this very moment. Go & live this week as if you really were  & have just been granted another chance at living the full life you dream of 🫶

Happy Real Me Monday xo

what would you post on social media if likes and followers didn't matter?

what clothing would you wear if you believed you are the hot AF person that you are?

how would you move your body if it didn't have any impact on how your body looks?

who would you spend time with if popularity and status didn't matter?

what situations would you leave if you trusted that there were new opportunities waiting for you?

the world we live in values appearances. how you look. how much money you make. numbers of likes. what you're wearing. what other people see.

we ALL want to be happy and to feel good, but it's hard to know how to do that when how our lives are perceived by others has a huge impact on how good we feel about them ourselves. but, just because something is good on paper, or what's expected from us by society, friends, family, or even ourselves, doesn't mean doing it is going to bring us happiness.

how your life feels is more important than how it looks, and life is way too short to focus on the stuff that doesn't really matter.

Doc ID: 2502, distribution: 0.2307177649158154 ; For the first  years of my relationship with Dylan, I hid my body away from him.

I hid behind baggy jumpers, long baggy jeans, wrapped my arms around myself in the shower, faced away from him when getting dressed, said no to photos and edited them whenever I did get photos, cried whenever I tried to find the courage to let him see me in my most vulnerable state, but I could never bring myself to. This was something I experienced before and after I'd started my health journey. [ad]

I was so afraid he'd see the “flaws” I grew up seeing villainised in the media: my rolls, my leg dimples, my belly poking out, my stretch marks, my curves where there “shouldn't” be and lack of curves where there “should” be.

He always told me I was beautiful, that he loves me the way I am, but until I loved myself there was no way I could believe someone else would find beauty in all the things I couldn't.

It was only once I addressed my inner-dialogue, the messages I consumed & started questioning what I thought “beauty” was over the last  years that changed this. Instead of trying to hide or change my body, I have been kinder to it… Because I didn't want to spend my life punishing my body or mind. Do you?

Accepting yourself doesn't just change the way you love yourself, it changes the way you allow others to love you. It changes the way you live your life. The way you feel, how you think, how much you believe in yourself.

There's such a freedom in showing up exactly as you are, because as small as that act may sound, it's not easy to do. I'm proud that I no longer feel a need to tense everything, suck it all in, hide it away, or change anything about myself. And I'm so dang proud of you, for working on being kinder to yourself too.

Doc ID: 2444, distribution: 1.0 ; It can be a confronting & confusing experience trying on clothes. Seeing yourself so exposed, under harsh lighting, with mirrors showing so many angles that you usually don't see yourself in… In one store, you might feel great, but the next makes you feel worse. One store you're a size M & the next you're an L. One mirror makes you look taller, another wider. The list goes on.

Happy ✨ Real Me Monday ✨ with a difference.

This was one of the triggers I had years ago that made me suddenly want to “start a new d!et”… Fitting rooms would tear any confidence I had left to shreds. I'd always end up in tears or completely deflated for the rest of the day.

So I wanted to leave these photos here to show you that it IS possible to eventually smile back at that reflection & not have it ruin your day. It is possible to not feel ashamed of being seen. It's possible to be at peace with your body & everything you've grown up being taught to hate. And it has nothing to do with actually changing your body… Just your mindset! 🧠 

I realise I'm saying this in a “thin” body which has its own privileges such as being able to find clothes in sizes that fit me & stereotypically fitting the beauty standard. But I can only showcase my reality & I'd rather do that then portray perfection. I know that most of the time, our own harshest critic is OURSELVES, so when it comes to our body image, it's about how WE view & speak to ourselves. 

You deserve your own kindness. When you get down about your appearance & dream of the “perfect” body, please remember there is no such thing… No matter what you see online!! Under different lighting, lenses, angles & poses, you'll always look different. But one day, you'll look in the mirror to see the same body that has kept you alive for  years… It won't look the same, but you'll realise the way it looked never really mattered, you'll just be grateful it's your home 🏡

Doc ID: 9727, distribution: 1.0 ; how your body looks or responds is not a reflection of you or your worthiness.

in the past, seeing the number go up on the scale or experiencing bloat automatically caused me to have bad body image and in turn, a bad day. sometimes, my body might not have even physically changed much if at all, but i'd have bad body image anyway and thought restriction was the answer.  these responses were rooted in fatphobia and a result of listening to the messages of diet culture, which i've learned to dismantle one by one and now know to be untrue.

now, i still get bad body image sometimes (although not very often anymore), but i'm able to recognize that bad body image thoughts are not a result of my body, but rather, a result of my mental state.

hating your body - even if it's a result of unhealthy behaviors, even if it's gone against what you've wanted it to, even if it's viewed by society as being less than - will affect your relationships, your work, your personality, how you view yourself, and your ability to live life to its fullest. you can't hate your body into being happy, i promise.

even when i've felt like it wasn't, my body has only ever done its best to be on my side. it doesn't deserve punishment or bullying. it deserves radical acceptance and compassion.

you are capable of taking the power away from the number on the scale, the amount of bloat you experience, the size of your jeans, the amount of fat on your body, and even the negative thoughts about your body.

you are so much more than a body.

Me when I just relax & stand up straight: 🚪 

Anyone else? 🙊 [ad]

But if you only accept your body when it looks a certain way, that's not self love, that's self objectification.

It's so easy for us to judge ourselves against others, but it's so important to remember that comparing:
✨ yourself to others
✨ your posed body to your relaxed body
✨ your achievements, job, productivity, every day life to someone else's online highlight reel
is TORTURE… & hardly fair.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love social media — but there's no denying that most share their best life & best versions of themselves on here, so it makes sense that we'll find ourselves comparing ourselves & our lives while scrolling through. 

Here are some things that helped me stop comparing myself:

🦋 Their beauty and/or success doesn't take away from yours
🦋 Perfection is an illusion - we only see what someone wants us to see. The photos that are posted are only % of someone's life. There are  hours in each day, and we usually only see a few minutes of someone's life online. (Myself included)
🦋 Bad body image days happen to us all — so if you think weight loss or a makeover is going to magically fix that, you're in for a shock 🙈 finding peace with your body & appearance happens when you start working from the inside out ✨
🦋 We're all living on a different timeline. Mark Zuckerberg might've created his multi-million dollar company in his dorm room as a teen, but Vera Wang didn't design her first dress until . 
🦋 Beauty is subjective - you might not see your beauty, but you also don't see the way your eyes light up at the sight of puppies or sunsets, so how can you really ever know your true beauty when you've only ever seen yourself in a mirror or photos?

Happy Real Me Monday 🌻

Doc ID: 2374, distribution: 0.3098919205206991 ; The reality of wearing a tight bodycon dress (& being human) 🤷🏻‍♀️

Leaving this here to gently encourage you:

🌟 Not to let your belly stop you from wearing the outfit you really wanna wear!!
🌟 Not to compare your body to someone else's, because I know that for a lot of us, we've grown up tensing & sucking it all in, instead of just letting our tummies be!
🌟 LET IT OUT! Be the change you wish to see in the world 🥹 I know that if I saw a girl wearing a bodycon dress like this & rocking her relaxed tummy in it, or someone wearing shorts with their cellulite on show, it would make me feel more confident & comfortable to do the same… Which could eventually be a domino effect where it allows someone else to feel comfortable to simply be themselves too.
🌟 Know that having fat on your body (especially your belly) is so normal. It's something you NEED in order to regulate your hormones, insulate you from the cold & have a healthy functioning body!! 
🌟 Your appearance is the LEAST important / interesting thing about you… 
🌟 If you don't feel comfortable wearing something, that's okay too! Change into something that you'll feel more confident in. Dressing for YOU is key 🥰
🌟 At the end of the day, who says that having a tummy sticking out isn't cute anyway? That's sooooo 's of us 💅 It's almost , let's all make our own beauty standards as diverse & inclusive as possible 🫶

I could go on forever but you get the picture!! I hope this gives you the confidence you deserve the next time you feel like you can't wear something because of the way your body looks 💗

DO YOU REALIZE HOW MESSED UP THAT IS? THAT HOW WE VIEW OUR WORTH IS IMPACTED BY SOMETHING LIKE THE SHAPE OF OUR BODIES? despite most women knowing that skinnier does NOT equal healthier, a LOT of women STILL want to lose weight or have body image struggles. why? because we have been conditioned to believe and are constantly reminded by our fatphobic society that our worth and how we are viewed are determined by how our body's look with no regard to our wellbeing.
——
we as a society put so much value in looking a certain way, but at the end of the day, i know that i am impacted by people's kindness, not their body fat %, i am inspired by others' authenticity, not their weight, i care about how someone makes me feel, not their jeans size, and i want my loved ones to be healthy even if that means being bigger.
——
with this message, i also want to acknowledge the thin privilege i have and how even though i've experienced negative body image that i've never experienced societal discrimination based on my size.  i whole heartedly believe that ALL bodies should be celebrated and that fat, rolls, lumps, and bumps are beautiful, yet i realize i don't understand what it's like struggling to find clothes in my size or getting told to lose weight at the doctor's office even when living a healthy lifestyle, and i still have fatphobic beliefs instilled in me that i need to keep working on overcoming. ALL PEOPLE ARE WORTHY and even though who we are and the way we act are more important than how we look, sometimes people get judged and treated a certain way because of their size before they're even able to show who they are. i don't have the answers for how to fix this, but i know that we can do better, and that starts with working on myself.

Doc ID: 2477, distribution: 0.4419674395983153 ; Perfectly human things on the human body that we should never be made to feel ashamed of… 🤗

Posting this video because I can almost guarantee there's some sort of device or product being advertised & sold to “fix” each & every one of these things… And the industry selling them sure has a wide audience to sell to, considering ALL OF US have these very normal, very human things on our bodies. But making us feel like we need to be fixed is their whole marketing strategy. Industries like that are built upon our self-esteem being knocked down. BUT I promise to continue to build y'all up, brick-by-brick & post-by-post 😤

Like the phrase goes: “if tomorrow, we woke up & decided we were actually okay with our body image, imagine how many industries would go out of business…” 🤯

These features are all part of being human. Some of us have more of these features than others, some have less. But none of it should really matter, in the end. You have so much more to offer & your body does so much more for you than just “look pretty”. I PROMISE YOU. 

If you're comfortable sharing, how many of these things do you have on your own body? 👆 I'd love to see the comments sprinkled with them to show others how common they really are.

How are we supposed to eventually reach a place of feeling comfortable in our skin if our expectations of beauty (or even just normal human features) aren't attainable?

My answer is, we can't. We just have to bring ourselves back to what's real, and not be so hard on those things, so that we can embrace everything we are 🌻

You do not need to be “fixed” 💛

Happy Real Me Monday 😌 just leaving these here every Monday to break up your feed a lil & remind you not to let your mind bully your body 🌟

We are who we tell ourselves we are. Your inner monologue holds the power over how you view yourself. So if you tell yourself “I'm not good enough” then that's exactly how you're going to feel & view yourself — your mind will cherry-pick all of the little things you've told yourself are bad/ugly. But if you start saying, “I'm more than enough & I see that now”, you're going to give your mind a chance to see how wonderful you really are 🌈 

In the comments, use only emojis to describe your inner monologue/self talk. Here's mine: 🥰🙌🏼🤩👑☀️ 

I also managed to get Dylan, my boyfriend/photographer, in this post!! 🙈 He was mimicking my RMM photos & poses, but then we decided to add his photo anyway because it isn't just women who struggle with unrealistic standards of beauty. Abs & chiselled muscles are typically the physical traits men strive for in order to feel “manly”, fit or attractive... But the bloat is real among us all 😅👏🏻

The truth is... Dylan & I both eat well, go to the gym, get enough rest, drink enough water & do all the things that are good for a healthy mind & body. And that's all we hope for, to be healthy & happy. Getting bloated & having some fat on our bodies DOES NOT take away from that. So I hope this will encourage you to feel the same way about yours! 👑

In case you haven't told yourself today, YOU ARE WONDERFUL! I encourage everyone in the comments to leave an uplifting comment on the person who commented before you... Let's make each other's day 🦋

Doc ID: 2511, distribution: 0.12921465455007797 ; “A woman's greatest asset is her beauty” well, here's what I think about that 🤦🏻‍♀️👇

However you identify: male, female or non-binary — you should never be made to feel as if the most important thing you have to offer is the way you look.

💪 Strength
⚡️ Resilience
🦋 A kind heart
❤️‍🔥 Passion
🧠 A brilliant mind
🫂 How you treat a person
🥳 A positive attitude
🔭 Curiosity
👻 Humour
🤝 Loyalty
🍕 The freedom to enjoy your life without restrictions 
🕺🏼 Being confident in your skin no matter how others perceive you

That's the start of a very long list of assets that are much greater than the way ANYONE looks.

Believe it or not, you can be whoever you want to be and show up in the world however you wish to show up. That, in itself, is a POWERFUL asset to have.

Plus, beauty is subjective. 

Someone might see a sunset & think it's the most beautiful thing they've ever seen, while another finds the aftermath of a storm the most beautiful. Just like YOU, when you see yourself, you may see all the things you'd like to change, but everyone who loves you loves you exactly the way you are. 

You will never be EVERYONE'S version of beautiful, but that doesn't matter… I just hope you'll be able to see your beauty and worth in all the little things that make you YOU (and your life YOURS).

Loving your body isn't believing your body looks good, it's knowing your body IS GOOD regardless of how it looks. It isn't thinking you are beautiful, it's knowing you are more than beautiful. It's understanding that your body is an instrument for your use, not an ornament to be admired.

What do you think your greatest asset is? 🙇🏻‍♀️ Toot your own horn in the comments!! 

Take this weekly reminder with you throughout your week & use it whenever you need it. I hope it helps you treat yourself a little kinder. Happy Real Me Monday! 🌸

Instead, what I want to be is KIND to myself & others, CONFIDENT in my skin & abilities, and unapologetically ME; my soft, messy, imperfect, true self.

So after years of putting myself down, struggling with body image & seeking validation from others, I choose to tell myself I am already good enough… & I carry out my every day life as if that is so. 

I've started showing up as the realest version of myself (right) & not the Instagram-version (left) that I've always felt I had to be, I began romanticising my daily tasks, being my own cheerleader, opting out of comparison, wearing the clothes I never believed I could wear, moving my body for nourishment instead of punishment & saying yes to invitations & things I never would've before.

Beauty doesn't have anything to do with the way the world perceives you. Confidence doesn't come from their opinion of you. Let them think what they think. What matters is what YOU see. Your body is your home. You can decorate it however you like, and if you think it's beautiful, that's all that matters. But at the end of the day, it's the stuff on the inside that counts & shines through.

You could be told everyday how beautiful you are by those around you, but you'll never see, believe or feel it unless you start viewing yourself for everything else that you are… because all the things that make you beautiful aren't found in the way that you look. You aren't your best or worst photo. You aren't your body or looks.

You are the warmth people feel when they see you laugh or smile, you are the kindness you show others, you are beautiful because of your story, your challenges, your strength, your ability to make others feel safe/seen/heard, the way that you light up when you're doing what you love, the confidence you have when you wear the clothes that make you feel good, the way you inspire others by owning your “flaws” & just being yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it when it's the least important thing about you. If you could be outside of your own eyes for a day, I think you'd see how much more you have to offer yourself & the world than the way your flesh sack looks. Please don't give it more power than all the light you have to shine ✨

I share these for my younger self, who felt a need to edit my photos to look a certain way online. There is nothing wrong with the left OR the right. Both are human, both are me, minutes apart. While I can't represent all bodies, I CAN showcase my reality & be part of the change I wish to see in the world. I hope to encourage you to be a lil kinder to yourself & live a life uncontrolled by the way that you look)🌷

This is why I post these “Instagram VS reality” type of posts, because it's one of my most impactful ways to show how curated social media is, why we shouldn't compare ourselves to others & how our bodies can look different ALL THE TIME!

These photos were taken on the same day, minutes apart. On the left, I'm standing tensed & posed or with lighting that softens the dimples on my body making me look like I'd walk around with a toned body every moment of the day… But then, less than  mins later, when I relax, you can see that my body looks almost entirely different. 

Both bodies workout. Both bodies live a balanced lifestyle. Both bodies can wear cute activewear (I'm wearing the new @gymshark Elevate & Camo in all photos - 'BREE' for % off [ad]). Both bodies bloat, wobble & look different in certain angles, poses & times of the day/month/year. 

I used to compare myself & punish my body, striving for a body that doesn't really exist and/or isn't entirely healthy or sustainable for me.

But now I understand that ️⃣ everyone I see online, in the media or even in person might not be how they or their lives look at all times ️⃣ I understand that we are all built differently, with different lifestyles & habits, so we cannot compare ourselves to anyone ️⃣ I can now appreciate ALL bodies & especially my body for what it does for me, instead of the way it looks, and ️⃣ finally, I understand now that having fat on my body, rolls, cellulite, stretch marks, loose skin, belly fat (etc) is so normal, part of being human, not in need of “fixing”, shouldn't discourage me from continuing to do my healthy habits & overall it's part of my happy, sustainable, healthy balance.

You may look down at it, you may feel it squish & wobble, you may see the way it looks in photos… But you'll never FEEL the warmth of your own hugs, or the softness of your touch, or the way other people feel empowered by seeing someone who looks like them. 

You will never, ever see your own face either. You will only see your reflection or a picture of yourself.

It's hardly fair to give your reflection all of the power you give it because you're always viewing yourself under this incredibly harsh microscope, with all of these unrealistic expectations, comparing yourself to others or the social media version of yourself, and constantly searching for the things you wish to change.

AND… You never see yourself when you're just being you.  
You never see the way your face lights up when you're laughing,
Or when you sing your favourite songs at the top of your lungs,
Or the way you let your guard down when you play with children & puppies,
Or the smiles you infect others with,
Or how safe you make others feel by encouraging them to be themselves,
Or the way your voice can make someone feel better instantly,
Or the way you can empower someone else by being unapologetically, unashamedly you.

You are essentially blind to the person the rest of the world sees. So you mustn't be so hard on yourself ❤️‍🔥

It's officially been  years since I first started this “Real Me Monday” series… WILD. Idk about you but I feel like I no longer look at myself under a microscope anymore. I no longer expect my body to look like anyone else's I see on social media / in the media. I feel like I see myself for all the goodness inside of me & that is really beautiful. I hope you see all your goodness too 🥹

Hope this weekly reminder sets you up for a kinder, gentler week. You've got this xo

i sometimes hesitate to post pictures of my body because i don't want any of you to compare your body to mine (if my posts make you feel any of less of yourself, please unfollow!). i still choose to post them though because it helps me feel empowered, and i hope that instead of seeing solely my body, you see the acceptance i have for it.

i know i don't have the experience of being in a significantly larger body and can't truly understand all that comes with being in one. but, i do know what it's like to feel the pressure to be smaller, to be societally “better”, and to literally be killing myself to get “there”. we've all only got one body that we can call our own.  while you are so much more than your body, and your body is in fact NOT the most important thing about you, we all deserve to feel comfortable in our own skin.

you deserve to look in the mirror and not want to change a thing.
you deserve to feel sexy.
you deserve to not let the size, shape, or composition of your body dictate how you feel about yourself.

ALL bodies are GOOD bodies, and you are beautiful and enough exactly as you are.

It's been  weeks of posting my 'IG vs reality' photos. I never could've imagined just how much sharing my reality would help me heal my relationship with my body image. If these posts have managed to encourage you on your own self acceptance / body confidence journey, let me know with a '🥰' in the comments!

I thought it was about time I had YOU GUYS involved in a Real Me Monday post!!! 👯‍♀️ I want all of you to feel represented & proud in your skin, so I'm going to be sharing some of your beautiful IG vs reality photos as well as my own in the weeks to come! Swipe through to meet some of the beautiful women who wanted to take part in this week's post! WE LOVE TO SEE IT! 💪🏼 Please show them some love in the comments below! 🥰 AAAAND, if you wanna be part of one of my future RMM posts, please email your photos through to me: realmemonday@gmail.com 💛

We may not feel beautiful or confident ALL THE TIME, but we still deserve to feed our minds positive thoughts. Self-talk is more powerful than you know. These are a few of the small changes I made when thinking/talking about my reflection:

“My legs are so wobbly” ➡️ “My legs are strong. They allow me to run, jump, lift, dance & take me wherever I need to go”
“I wish my tummy was flat” ➡️ “My tummy expands throughout the day because I feed it well & that food gives me the energy I need to be as healthy as possible” 💪🏼
“How do I get rid of cellulite” ➡️ “% of women have cellulite. It's the way our fat cells are stored & isn't something to be ashamed of”

So next time you're putting yourself down, try to turn the negativity into more positive thoughts like these! Telling yourself “I LOVE MY BODY” when you don't actually feel that way is probably not going to work... But realistic swaps like these may help you slowly start to love & accept your body! Try it & let me know!! 🌈

Most importantly, Happy Real Me Monday! This series first began  months ago after Dylan took some photos of me in a swimsuit. I was flicking through the photos when I saw all of the little outtakes, the unposed, in-between photos where my body was relaxed & typically not “Insta-worthy” — my first thought was to delete them & destroy all evidence that I have a normal, human body… 🤯 It held so much power over me that it ruined my entire day.

But I didn't want to feel that way towards myself for the rest of my life, so I figured one way towards me learning to accept my body as a whole is to just start showing up as myself, instead of this perfected, filtered, “aesthetic” version of myself. 

So for the first time in my life, instead of deleting them, I posted them… And over time, I got more & more comfortable… If you scroll through my page, you can see me gradually become more open & confident as each Monday passes.

Since then, I've posted about  posed VS real photos. It's amazing how much has changed for me when it comes to self acceptance, and I know it's going to be an ongoing thing… So taking you guys along with me over the years (through pregnancy, age & just life in general) is going to be a journey in itself. But I'm so grateful I've started putting in the work now. Realising that my body & other people's opinions of me doesn't have to affect my self-worth has been a huge revelation for me. 

It all begins & ends in your mind. What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it. Your mind and body is your home. If you don't take care of it, no one else is going to! ✨

Doc ID: 2530, distribution: 1.0 ; Over this year, my hair has changed, my body has changed, my dress size has changed, my life has changed, but my worth has not & neither has yours!! 👑 

Welcome to a special Real Me Monday  recap!! Here's my fav RMM photos from across the year to remind you that bodies are ever-changing & to never compare yourself to what you see online or in the media. 

Not only does your body change day-to-day & year-to-year, but also with different lighting, poses, angles or clothing, so it's hardly fair to base your worth or judge yourself on something as fickle & ever-changing as your body.

Let me put things into perspective for you... While you feed negative thoughts to your body every day, this is what it's doing for you:

❤️ your heart is beating , times per day & you believe you're not worthy of your own love because you have a few cute dimples on your legs?
🥙 your tummy is SO STRONG that your stomach acid can dissolve IRON & yet you have the audacity to feel GUILTY when you feed it & nourish it well? 💪🏼 
🦠 half of our body consists of bacteria & yet you wish you were half your size in order to fit a beauty standard that isn't realistic? 🥺
🧬 while you scroll through IG & compare yourself to strangers, your body has sent more than ,,,,, nerve impulses throughout your brain, your hair has collectively growth .”, you've blinked - times & you've pumped more than mL of oxygen into your lungs. These are just a FEW things that play a huge role in keeping you alive & as healthy as possible 🤯

Don't underestimate how FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE your body is!!!! It's your home. Sure, decorate it the way you like, but please love it along the way 💛 

I think  is the year you no longer hold yourself back! Wear the shorts, enjoy the food, move your body bc you can — not bc you have to, be gentle with yourself & remember that your body is the least interesting thing about you!! Leave a “🥂” in the comments if you're with me! 🥰

In case you forgot this lately, here's a refresher: it's perfectly fine to look different to the people and bodies you see online. I can certainly appreciate the beauty of another woman, for e.g. Tammy is STUNNING and her body is incredible!!! But do I feel less loveable, less worthy & less confident because of that? No... Because . I will never be her, so what's the point in comparing? & . We're all built differently, we all live different lifestyles & we are all unique. 

As you may have seen on my IG story today, these are a few things that have helped me not compare myself to others anymore & find confidence in my own skin:
🌟 follow accounts that make you feel good about yourself & more confident in your skin!
🌟 remember that Instagram is basically a highlight reel of our lives!! We never post the 'losing my sh*t', 'having an absolute meltdown', 'sitting on the toilet' versions of ourselves online... But we're all human and have those moments!
🌟 while you admire others online, remember that someone else looks at your photos & feels the same way about you!! 
🌟 fuel your body with nutritious foods, fit some physical activity into your day & get a good amount of sleep each night, you'll just feel better all round! 💪🏼 
🌟 you will never look like an influencer... Most of the time they don't even look like the photos they post online! There are sooo many editing apps out there now that allow us to change even the smallest of things we don't like about our bodies, and a lot of people do... (No, this isn't directed at Tammy either, this is just in general!)
🌟 your body is just the vessel you live in, it's what's on the inside that matters the most! Work on YOU for you!! 💛

Wow, I'm full of pep talks today aren't I? So sorry, but also, sometimes it's exactly what we need to hear!!! 😂👏🏻

Doc ID: 2730, distribution: 1.0 ; ☀️ Instagram is the perfect place to compare... Am I right? But life is SHORT and we don't get a do-over. I asked myself at the start of this year, “When I'm , will I regret letting my body image issues stop me from wearing bikinis at the beach? Will I be mad that I hid my body underneath baggy clothes because it didn't look like the ones I saw on my instagram feed? Would I be able to live with knowing I spent my whole life sabotaging my own happiness and health every day?” 😅⁣
⁣
So, I guess part of the reason I've been posting more photos of my body like this than any 'perfectly posed' photos is because I want to normalise natural bodies — all of the imperfections included. I eat well, I live an active lifestyle, I'm healthy and I STILL have rolls on my belly, cellulite on my legs and stretch marks on my hips... These things are normal and NOTHING will get rid of them completely, so why not learn to love them? 👏🏻 I, too, am still teaching myself how to embrace the imperfections and focus less on self-image because the way we look is much less important, it's the stuff on the inside that counts: your health, happiness and heart 💛⁣

Doc ID: 9457, distribution: 1.0 ; how can you feel like your body is your home if you're viewing it as a temporary place to live?

i'm not anti-having body-related goals, and i believe in body autonomy, but i also think there are a lot of people who use trying to manipulate and change their bodies as a way to try and find self-love and self-acceptance when true self-love and self-acceptance are not things that come from being a certain size or fitting into a certain image or box.

i spent a lot of years at war with my body, constantly blaming my body, resenting my body, and trying to control my body. i viewed my body as being separate from me and something that was temporary. the truth i had to face was that whether i liked what i saw in the mirror or not, i only ever have one body, and it's the forever home to my soul. 

you can't hate yourself or your body into a person or body you love, and the only way to really feel at home and comfortable in your skin is through unconditional acceptance.

loving your body isn't about loving how it looks all the time. gentle reminder that you don't have to love how your body looks to choose to take care of it, be kind to it, nourish it, and accept it.

Doc ID: 2358, distribution: 0.21798314736785515 ; One day I had to sit down with myself & decide that I would love myself, no matter what my body looks like 🤝

Did you know that Dylan takes all of my 'Real Me Monday' photos? But would you also believe there was a solid FIVE years at the start of our relationship where I wouldn't let him see my body at all? 

At the time, it was so deeply engrained in me that I wasn't worthy of being seen or loved the way I was. I didn't want him to see that my body was soft instead of firm, that my legs were covered in cellulite, the way the loose skin on my tummy sagged when I bent over slightly or that my tummy was bigger than my chest.

The issue was never him, or anyone else, it was my own body image & all of the messages I'd taken as “fact” over the years about what was acceptable & what wasn't. 

Dylan's always told me he loves me exactly the way I am, that he'll love me just as much when I'm wrinkly all over. But it doesn't matter how many people tell you you are something, because YOU have to believe it for it to have any merit.

Nobody else sees you the way YOU see you. The people who really love you will only see your body as the beautiful, ever-changing flesh sack that homes your soul.

It saddens me to think that for  years of my life, whether I was at my largest or smallest, I really believed that the real, unposed, relaxed, soft version of my body (in the above photos, on the right) were any different or less loveable than the posed, “perfected”, sucked-in version of my body (on the left).

Remembering this time in my life is heartbreaking, but it's also a beautiful reminder… 
🪞 You are so much more than your body or the way that you look. 
🏡 It is possible to create a better relationship with yourself so that you feel comfortable in your skin.
💗 You are not loved for your looks, you are loved for your heart.
👋 It's okay to let go of the beauty / body expectations we grow up around.
💌 Embracing your true self & being authentically you will inspire so many others around you without you even knowing it.
🫂 You (& your body) are already worthy of being seen & respected.

who is anyone but myself to say that there is anything wrong with it?? while i live in a privileged body, there are many parts of me that i spent a lot of years feeling insecure about, crying over, hiding, and trying to change.  it wasn't until i chose to start losing the weight of judgements and expectations rather than weight off my body that i finally realized that i had the power to accept my body no matter what stage it was in and started to truly love my body for all that it does.

although what you look like is really not important AT ALL, you deserve to feel comfortable in your home. while you can try to “get that person's body” all you want, this body you have right now is the only body you will only ever have, and its differences are part of what makes it so special. you're not beautiful like her because you're beautiful like YOU.

Take note of the REAL smile in the first slide here 🥲 in the past I would've believed the better photo is the one my body looks more toned & “Insta-worthy” in, but now I realise we're all worthy of being seen no matter what, and the best photos are the ones we're just being our comfortable, happy selves in.

You know, I used to allow the way I viewed my body to dictate how much I should or shouldn't eat, or what I should or shouldn't wear.

I felt bad for bloating.

I felt bad that my body changed & expanded after eating or drinking.

I wouldn't wear a fitted dress if my body did expand throughout the day.

I'd change into something baggy if my tummy wasn't flat or if my cellulite was too noticeable.

When I used to go out, I was too busy worrying about the way I looked or how others perceived me to enjoy myself & actually LIVE in that moment. 

WHY??? Why do we do this to ourselves?
 
We're not supposed to be perfect (whatever “perfect” is).

Plus, everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to criticise you! 🙈 

So… This week I challenge you to fuel your body & still wear that cute dress or those shorts or whatever outfit it is that you've been too afraid to wear — and just ROCK IT!! 🥳 

This weekly series is here to remind you not to compare your life or your body to someone on the internet, to encourage you to be a little gentler with yourself as we go into a new week & to give you some examples of HOW you might be able to do that.

I can't believe I still see so many “transformation” photos like this.

Most of the time, they're taken on the same day with the same outfit, just posed differently or edited in order to convince you that you can achieve the same results in a short period of time using their “solution” AKA a product of some sort. There are so many industries that survive on the back of a society who believes they need to be fixed. Our insecurities fill their pockets.

So I'm just leaving this here to tell you…

Each of the photos in this post were taken just a few seconds apart. Both are me. Both are healthy. Both are good enough.

I know that today could be the day you decide to kickstart your health journey to reach your “body goals” after a weekend of simply ✨ ENJOYING YO LIFE ✨ and there's nothing wrong with working on yourself whichever way you want to, but I'll just leave this here as a reminder that you don't need to “fix” or change or punish your body today. 

A woman who works out regularly, eats well and lives a healthy lifestyle can have belly fat, cellulite, stretch marks, and doesn't always look as toned as she may appear online (for e.g. me). So if you want to start adding healthier habits into your life today, forget the shortcuts or quick-fixes, forget the “Get rid of cellulite in  days with this!”… 

You can make positive changes to your life in ways that don't feel like punishment at all. And you can still eat a well-rounded diet that includes snack nights with friends and dining out with family. There's no need for you to make up for anything you did or ate over the weekend. Please, go into this week treating yourself only with kindness and love!

If we base our self-worth on something as ever-changing as our bodies, we will forever be on the emotional rollercoaster of body obsession and shame. 

Happy Real Me Monday! 💛

Doc ID: 19559, distribution: 0.4466406012650674 ; Day  of inpatient was kind of weird but not necessarily in a bad way. I didn't sleep well so I was up early. We didn't have anything scheduled in the morning so I did my laundry, cleaned my room, changed my sheets, and hung up pictures and posters. It was a very productive morning but I was also really anxious. I had a doctor's appointment outside of the hospital so I got to go on pass for that. It was weird being off the unit and around so many people. I've been really anxious lately and I don't know why.

I went to group and then on a walk and then hung out with my roommate. I had a visitor who brought me dinner and we played cards. Then I went to art group and talked to a staff member about musicals.

I'm just frustrated that they're saying no bc of the way it would look and not safety. I would be more okay with it if it was a safety concern.

Answer: I've only been in two different places so I don't really have much to compare but I'll try my best. I was admitted involuntarily to an inpatient hospital near where I go to school (in a different state). That hospital didn't have any groups or activities during the day and we weren't allowed in our rooms unless we were sleeping. They also didn't have psychiatrists or therapists. Basically there was one large room where all the patients sat together and watched tv all day. That hospital was pretty bad. The one I'm in now is supposedly the best psychiatric hospital in the US. I've been to this inpatient unit three times now and it's very nice compared to the other one. Our day is very structured and we have different activities we can go to (but we're not forced to). We have several groups each day like CBT, DBT, ACT, art therapy, walks, music, and more. We are also assigned a psychiatrist and a social worker to coordinate everything while we're there and also aftercare planning. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Doc ID: 19940, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I got moved up to level  so I was finally allowed to go on walks.

The racist and homophobic and transphobic and anti Semitic guy was complaining about me and my friends even though all we did was walk past him. He accused us of taunting him and trying to provoke him. Then he started calling my friend “the bitch who looks like a heroin addict” and that was the last straw. I walked out of the room we were in and stood across from him (with staff in between) and yelled at him and called him a “fucking bigot” and then staff got mad at me and escorted me to a different wing of the hospital. It was also Chinese New Year today so my parents visited and brought Chinese food and that was nice. I'm just angry and frustrated and the people here are really great (for the most part) but it's just hard when you're stuck around the same people for so long and there aren't many lounges or places to go. I hope tomorrow will have less drama. Maybe they'll only have to call security once as opposed to the three times they called today. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19459, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  was kind of garbage. I woke up and was in a bad mood. Then my roommate got moved to a different room and we got along well so that sucked. I had a phone call with the department of mental health and that made me feel worse. I slept for most of the morning just to avoid everything. I spent the afternoon with friends and some friends from school visited me. I also had to deal with some invalidating stuff about my gender and that made me more upset. It was just a bad day. I'm glad I got to see my friends though. I'm also glad that I have friends on the unit who support me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19329, distribution: 1.0 ; Days  and  of inpatient were okay. Day  wasn't very good. I had an okay day but still slept for most of the day shift. The evening was hard and I self harmed again. I've been feeling pretty shitty physically in addition to mentally because of the whole concussion situation. Day  was better. I spent time with friends for most of the day. The weather was nice so the walks were fun. I got to see my dogs. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 22204, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was the best one yet! I got moved up to level three, which means my dogs can visit me and I can get passes to leave the unit. The highlight of my day was seeing all three of my dogs and getting to walk them around the hospital grounds. I ate a lot of food today and I'm proud of myself for that. I struggled a little after but I forced myself to stay in open areas and used some of the coping mechanisms I've learned here. Overall, it was a really great day and I'm so grateful for the staff and my safety. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19960, distribution: 0.5987103634326929 ; Admit day and day  of inpatient were not great but they started to get better. Admit day was pretty awful and there wasn't much to do. I spent most of the day in the clinical evaluation center and I didn't really talk to anyone. I mostly stayed in my room. Day  was okay. I struggled with self harming and stayed in my room for the first half. I didn't do great with eating either. I started to meet more people toward the end of the day and that's been really nice. I like everyone and it's making my time here easier. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21898, distribution: 0.46633320603546075 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty bad. I got taken down to ect early which I thought would be good because I'd get it over with. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to take my premed so I got a horrible headache after and it lasted the whole day. They also increased the settings and that didn't help. I didn't end up going to any groups because I felt too crappy. Today marks the beginning of my fifth week here and I'm starting to get really sick of seeing the same twenty people every day with no way to escape or avoid certain people. The staff has been really great (most of the time) and I'm so grateful for everything they do. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19805, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was probably the best day I've had here. I was more outgoing than usual and talked to a lot of people. I like greeting the new patients and helping them get used to the routine. I went to a bunch of groups today and that was good. My friends later in the day and it was nice to see them. Then my friends and I got bubble tea delivered and I shot the boba through the straw at people. Overall it was a good day. I have a family meeting tomorrow and I'm nervous about that. I'll try to post some of my writing tomorrow. I just need to figure out how to post it bc the entries/essays are like two pages. Idk let me know if you have any ideas.

Doc ID: 19281, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I got my off unit privileges back so I was able to go on the walks and that was really nice.

I'm a little anxious as the weekend approaches because those are usually hard for me but I'm hoping for the best. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19494, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty shitty. I was really tired so I slept for most of the morning. I had a meeting with one of the tms doctors and it didn't go well. I tried to go to some groups in the afternoon but I didn't end up going to that many. My night was hard. I'm so tired of being here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19946, distribution: 0.3107176401570581 ; Day  of inpatient started out really bad. I woke up not feeling great because I didn't sleep well the night before. Things continued to get worse and it got really bad after my family visited. It was just a bad visit and I feel like they don't understand mental illness and they aren't trying to learn about it and they're just not very supportive in general. I stayed in my room after the visit and struggled a lot with self harm and suicidal thoughts. I eventually left my room (after several hours) and spent some time with my friends. We had a really fun time and it cheered me up a lot. Today was one of my hardest days out of all of my hospitalizations but tonight was also one of the best nights I've had in a long time. I'm trying to focus on that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19591, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient started out really shitty but got a lot better. I woke up late and went back to bed immediately after meeting with the weekend doctor and taking care of ADLs. My dogs were going to visit today but I got dropped a level bc of self harm and other stuff so they couldn't come. That made me upset so I stayed in bed for the whole day shift and barely talked to anyone. I had a visitor and that was nice. My day started to get better after that. I spent the rest of the day playing games with friends and that was fun. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19662, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was one of my best days. I got moved up to level three, which means I can go on walks with family on hospital grounds. My parents brought my dogs and it was so nice to see them. My friend left this morning and I miss her. I spent most of the day going to groups and spending time with friends. I'm isolating less and that's good. I had a good night and I'm optimistic about the rest of the week. I also learned that another one of my favorite staff members is leaving and I'm sad about that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19668, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was mostly good. I spent time with friends in the morning and then went to tms. I took a nap after tms and then went to some groups. I found out that my friend is leaving tomorrow and I'm sad. My anxiety is really bad right now and I'm not doing well. The rest of the day was good though. My doctor told me that I will be here for a long time and that's a bummer. It hasn't really hit me yet. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19410, distribution: 0.19003262093071932 ; Day  of inpatient was absolute shit. I was really anxious the whole day and my depression was really bad. I slept for most of the morning. I went to a couple groups but I was in a bad mood for the entire day. They searched my roommates side of the room three times and searched mine twice. They also did a body search. I'm just really anxious bc they found some pieces that I had hidden and I feel so guilty and worried that they're mad at me or hate me and I just feel awful. It was just one of the worst days I've had here and I'm so frustrated and feel defeated and hopeless. I don't know what to do anymore. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19779, distribution: 0.6946816518051382 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty awful. I barely slept last night so I woke up in a bad mood. Then I saw that a nurse complained about me on her Twitter and that made me feel like shit. I spent most of my day in my room crying and listening to sad music. My friends visited for a bit and that was nice. I just couldn't really enjoy anything today. I was super anxious and depressed and had a headache. It was just a really bad day. And my nurse is going to do a blind weight tomorrow and I'm anxious about that. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19376, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was good. I went to a lot of groups and kept busy for the whole day. I wanted to nap but I spent time with friends instead so I'm proud of myself for that. I did some more drawing and ordered some more art supplies bc the ones here aren't very good. I had some good conversations with staff and that was nice. I'm hoping that my meeting with my treatment team goes well tomorrow. I have some things I want to talk about and I hope that they're willing to listen bc sometimes it feels like they just dismiss me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19530, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I was greatly anxious for most of the day but I was able to keep myself distracted. I had two visits today and that was nice but also made me anxious. I worked on a puzzle for most of the day and also talked to some friends from school and that was good. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19516, distribution: 0.337082598075089 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't very good. I got woken up early for tms and that put me in a bad mood. I was really groggy all morning and people kept trying to talk to me but apparently I wasn't very responsive. I was in bed basically all morning and I'm not even sure if I was fully conscious. I don't remember most of this morning but my nurse said that a bunch of staff members said I seemed out of it and was not communicating very well or at all. Honestly all I remember is that a few people came to check on me and I had brief conversations with them but I don't know what they said or what I said. I only know that they happened. I felt better later in the day and was more able to function. Then things got bad at night and I'm worried that my doctor will take away more privileges. I guess we'll see.

Doc ID: 19897, distribution: 0.38968720643999205 ; Day  of inpatient was weird. It started out really bad because I didn't sleep well last night. I was supposed to wake up early and stay out of my room today but that didn't happen. The day sort of got better but it also felt like I was dreaming the entire time. My friends visited and it was nice but I few like I wasn't really present for it at all. My mood wasn't great today but it wasn't too bad. I mostly felt numb and empty and I don't know if that's better or worse than the usual depressed mood. Oh well. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19952, distribution: 0.3039258385752435 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. I woke up pretty early and hung out with my roommate and that was nice. We talked about our lives and got to know each other. We're very different people but we were still able to connect and bond. The weekends here are kinda quiet and there isn't much to do so I spent a lot of time just sitting around. My friend and her mom came to visit and that was fun. The afternoon and evening were tough for me. I'm still struggling with self harm and eating. They tried to get me to drink ensure but I really don't like the taste so I didn't drink it. I was eventually able to force myself to eat some pizza so that's progress. My mood was pretty low today but hopefully it'll get better soon. I'm also not sleeping very well here and that's been a struggle. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19860, distribution: 0.7058008216935155 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I distracted myself for most of the day so my mood was okay. I wrote some more stuff and spent time with friends and my aunt came to visit. I let the staff read my writing and it was really scary but I think it's a step in the right direction. They've been telling me that it's helped them understand me better because I'm not always comfortable saying how I'm feeling out loud. Writing is just easier for me and it feels good to let it out. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19642, distribution: 0.1440422132407032 ; Question: What happened during the meeting? I'm sorry about the family friend 😞 Answer: The meeting just made me really anxious because it was my social worker, my nurse, and the DMH representative all in the same room and the DMH lady was asking me a bunch of questions and I was too anxious to say anything so my nurse and social worker helped answer things and it was weird to hear them talking about me but I'm glad they were there to help. It also just kind of hit me how serious this is because I've been downplaying the severity of my symptoms and I'm so used to living like this that it feels normal even though it's really not. Basically everyone agreed that I'm not safe enough to step down to a less restrictive program or live at home and do outpatient stuff. My nurse and I also tried to explain that living at home with my parents is not a good idea and a residential program would be better but the DMH lady didn't seem to understand that. I just know that being at home with my parents would make my mental health worse. The goal is to keep me out of a state hospital and to be able to use DMH services (if they determine that I'm eligible, which hopefully they will). Unfortunately, I might not be approved and even if I do get approved, it takes a long time to put those services in place so I'm going to be stuck here for the foreseeable future. Idk the meeting kinda just made me feel more hopeless because I'm finally starting to realize how bad things really are and it's scary. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21385, distribution: 0.6357541430001268 ; Day  of inpatient was really good! I had a good meeting with my doctor, which was a pleasant surprise. I got to spend time with friends and I got to know some more people. I went to almost all of the groups today and they were all really good. Overall, today was one of my best days here and I'm so grateful for all the friends I've made here and the amazing staff. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19370, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. We didn't have my groups today so I spent most of the day drawing and watching tv with friends. It wasn't a great day for mental health and there were some triggers that made things harder. I was able to stay safe and talk things through for staff and that's a pretty big deal for me bc I'm usually too scared to ask for help. I hope tomorrow is a good day. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19575, distribution: 0.19241660144829725 ; Question: I'm always curious about people's inpatient stays because I've never gone but feel like sometimes I might need to but I never know how to get there or what to say :/ Have all of your stays been from a section? Or did you bring yourself there? How long has each one been? How do you know when you need to leave? Have you ever wanted to leave but they said no or wanted to stay and they made you leave? Sorry for all the questions :( Answer: Hi! You don't have to apologize for asking questions. I don't mind answering them and I have nothing else to do. I didn't really have a choice with any of my hospitalizations but technically only one of my stays was because of a section. Basically my therapist asked me if I would agree to go or if she would have to “pink slip” me, which is what they call it in Ohio. I agreed to go and they took me to the ER and the ER sectioned me even though I said I would go inpatient. The other three hospitalizations have been voluntary on paper but in those situations it was more of a “you can agree to go or we will make you go” so it wasn't really that voluntary. It just shows up differently on your records. My first hospitalization (the pink slip one) was only  hours. That hospital was terrible so I lied my way out of there (I do not recommend doing this because I just ended up getting hospitalized a month later). The second hospitalization was about a month and a half. The third one was about two weeks. The current hospitalization is two months and counting. I don't really know how I know when I need to leave. I don't particularly want to be here but my treatment team determines when I am ready to leave. I really don't have any say in any of that. I could sign a three-day, which would mean that they have three business days to evaluate whether or not I need to stay and they will either discharge you or section you. I was told that I would just get sectioned if I try to sign one so I'm not going to bother. I have wanted to leave many times and they won't let me. I've never wanted to stay and been kicked out because they would be liable if anything happened to me after discharge. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19915, distribution: 0.4160023491412106 ; Day  of inpatient was weird. I woke up early and felt really energized and I was super productive. I felt good for most of the day but there was always the thought at the back of my head that the good feeling wasn't going to last and that I would eventually crash and burn. I managed to make it through most of the day feeling okay but it hit me hard at night. I felt the worst that I've felt since I've been here and it was really hard. I was barely moving or communicating with the staff and it was overall not a good situation. I agreed to take a PRN after a lot of encouragement and I feel a little better now. I'm mostly just tired. They wouldn't let me go to my room because they didn't think I was safe enough so they kept me in open areas. The meds they gave me are kicking in and I am super tired. Hopefully I'll feel more stable and regulated tomorrow. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19786, distribution: 0.2962458922183257 ; Day  of inpatient was mixed. I was in a really good mood this morning bc my friend shipped me my chest binder and it felt really good to wear it. I met with my treatment team and they said that I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Also my insurance company denied tms treatment but the doctor said he would do it for free. A lot of my friends (patients) left today and I'm happy for them but I'll miss them. It's also hard to see so many people come here after me and leave before me. I spent a lot of the day crying bc so many people were leaving. It was my favorite staff member's last shift tonight and that was super hard for me. She was the first staff member I met and the first one I trusted. It's bittersweet bc I know that she's moving on to a better job but I'm going to miss her so much. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19686, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was good. I slept better last night so I felt more rested today. My goal was to keep myself busy and out of my room and I was able to do that.

The rest of the day was good though so I'm trying to focus on that.

Doc ID: 19773, distribution: 0.49527147614785344 ; Day  of inpatient wasn't great. I didn't sleep well last night and my depression was bad so I spent most of the day sleeping or isolating in my room. My parents visited and brought me dinner so that was nice. It was just a very boring day. I got anxious toward the end of the night and my headache got worse. I was really anxious about the blind weight but I talked to my nurse and that was nice. I'm trying not to worry about it but it's hard.

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19279, distribution: 0.46216772813867335 ; Day  of inpatient was hard. I slept through most of it because I just couldn't deal.

------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19503, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was okay. I didn't do much this morning. I went to all of the groups in the afternoon and I liked most of them. I had a fun time just doodling and drawing things for staff. I didn't feel great today but I was able to distract myself for most of the day. The night got really hard for me but my nurse helped me a lot so that's good. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19909, distribution: 0.4126038456007762 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty bad. I woke up a lot later than usual because my anxiety medication made me really tired. I wasn't able to go on any of the walks today because the staff didn't think I was safe to go. They made me stay in open areas the whole day and I was so bored. My aunt and my parents visited and it didn't go well. It was fine with my aunt but my parents said that I would have to pay for residential treatment. I was already having a bad depression day and that just made me feel worse. I already feel like a burden to them and that just made me feel bad. I was able to spend some time with friends and that made me feel better. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19921, distribution: 0.3887729584210547 ; Day  of inpatient started out really bad but got better at night. I got woken up by my treatment team and I was super groggy for awhile. A lot of shit went down today with other patients and some of it was triggering so my anxiety was bad. My depression was also really bad today and I spent most of the afternoon/evening in my room. I eventually felt a little better and hung out with my friends. We listened to music and played cards and ordered ice cream and it was fun. It's my friend's last night and I'm happy for her but it's hard to see all my friends go home while I'm still here. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19288, distribution: 0.382703343099666 ; Day  of inpatient was pretty good. I am trying to appreciate the little things and I think I have become less critical when it comes to rating my days here. The past few days were really rough for me and I honestly hit a low point. Before this weekend I would have said that today was shitty but now in comparison it was a good day. I got off of one to one supervision and I can't express how amazing it felt to be able to use the bathroom and take a shower without someone watching me the entire time. I was still restricted to one hallway but I was allowed to go to groups and staff members and patients were allowed to talk to me. Two days in complete isolation was very difficult for me and I'm so happy to be done with that. I'm hoping to gain back some more privileges tomorrow. I'm going to try really hard to make healthy choices for myself and making those choices has always been a big struggle for me. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 19537, distribution: 1.0 ; Day  of inpatient was actually really good. Weekends here are usually super boring and my closest friends were both out on pass for most of the day and I was worried about being alone but it was a surprisingly good day. I ended up meeting some of the new patients and making more friends and that was nice. My parents visited and I got to see my dogs and then my friends came back and we played games and just talked. My depression and anxiety were both very manageable today and I had a really good conversation with a staff member. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 21961, distribution: 0.21812290461288003 ; Question: i don't know how to ask this but did you go there willingly? what's it like? i need help and i'm scared  Answer: Hey! Making a decision about whether to go to the hospital is really tough and scary. It's a very personal decision and know that the staff there will be there to support you and keep you safe. It's hard to ask for help but you are so worth it and there are people who love you and care about you. Ultimately, going willingly is generally better because you want to be engaged in your treatment but it's also okay if you don't go willingly. Try not to feel ashamed about how you end up in the hospital and focus more on your recovery and moving forward. The first time I was hospitalized I went sort of willingly and sort of unwillingly. Basically, I was told by my achool's counseling center that I could go on my own or they would pink slip me (which basically means force me to go). I was then brought to the ER where I was formally pink slipped. This time, I was supposed to start a partial hospitalization program and the intake person suggested that I go inpatient instead. I agreed because I thought it would be best for me and I do not regret my decision.Each day follows the same basic structure but has different groups and activities. The first hospital didn't have groups so it was really boring. They try to keep us pretty busy here so we have groups and activities most of the day. The morning starts with breakfast at am and ends with wrap-up group at pm. I was pretty scared my first few days here but I've slowly adjusted and found my way. I've been here for quite some time now so I've gotten to know the staff and the other patients. We get a lot of free time and the groups and activities are never mandatory. They do take attendance and attendance is strongly encouraged but you're never forced to go. Unfortunately, it still gets boring around here even with the groups and activities. I've found that it's helpful to get to know the other patients because they get what you're going through and you can all support each other. I've met some really great people here and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to be at such a wonderful hospital. Please don't hesitate to send in more questions or DM me if that's easier for you. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I have plenty of time to do so.

Doc ID: 22286, distribution: 0.19672666274427664 ; Day  of inpatient started out pretty bad but it got better as the day went on. I had a meeting with my parents, my social worker, and my psychiatrist and it was really stressful and didn't go well. I wanted to self harm after but I talked to staff instead and they helped me. I made a new friend today and I'm becoming better at advocating for myself and talking to the staff when I need to. As always, I'm grateful for the friends I have here and the amazing staff. I honestly couldn't do it without them.

If anon wants me to expand on a point, they can send another ask in. I don't owe anyone an essay in response to a question. Sometimes I choose to write more and sometimes I don't.If you send me a question on anon, there is no need to be scared of the reply because nobody will know it came from you. You can even use it as an exercise in developing resilience. I don't mean that patronisingly because I have done it myself and become much more able to deal with anon negativity you message me about something and feel that I am jumping down your throat in response because you accidentally wrote the wrong thing or I took it in a different way to what you meant, you can message me again with a clarification and we can resolve it.You can message me off-anon and I will reply with the respect that someone who is brave enough to make themselves known deserves.

 dumb-pig-bitch: 

 well…. after about a month of not being on this blog ive considerably changed my perspective on the “ed community” and i % regret having ever made this blog. so probably gonna make a long ass post about how violent this “community” is and how strongly it perpetuates predatory, colonial ideals of beauty and actively discourages any useful conversation around fighting mental illness. also, the ed community is riddled with internalized misogyny, but i mean… thats pretty much the basis of the entire community so… ya know. also no matter how many posts anyone, including myself, have made about not being pro ana and blah blah blah or whatever the fuck, having an ed blog is still pro ana. the ed community is peak glamorization of mental illness and its extremely fucking gross considering how many whole ass adults are on here promoting a glamorized image of eating disorders to minors.

 For all those who glorify your EDs or hold onto them for social media fame or think you'll one day grow out if it:  I went to treatment in . It's . I was just contacted by a former patient I went to treatment with. She got me up to speed with the progress of our former friends. Two have died. Many have relapsed and are still struggling.  Again. This was . I was . Most of the girls there were in there s. And now we are in our s and some of us in our s. The person who contacted me is in her s and going back into residential in a few weeks.  Let that sink in. Tumblr gives you a false reality. Eating disorders don't stop when you reach a certain age. Eating disorsers don't end once you hit  and are ready to trade in your pumpkin spice lattes and ugg boots and small apartments.  They continue when you buy that house and pay your first mortgage and get engaged and married. They are there when you get pregnant or have kids and go to your first PTA meeting. And sometimes they continue when you are  and getting a mammogram because you're old enough now to regularly get those. They are there when you have menopause and they are there when your hair goes grey.  So if you think you'll be spared, you won't. Unless, of course, you get help.  You think any of us back in  thought that in , we'd STILL be struggling? Hello no. We got help because we wanted to be DONE. And even then we all fucking relapsed. Not because treatment didn't work, but because EDs are a bitch and need constant recovery.  Had I not gotten pregnant, my life would have gone into the shitter. And even with my daughter, I STILL can't let go of the food.  Eating disorders are not jokes, man. They are with you for life. Recovery needs to be lifelong or you will be that -year-old woman either dying of her ED or still in treatment.

The important thing is following recovery accounts that are genuine and real that dont sneak in their thinness or have an illusion of recovery while remaining underweight. That shit is fake as hell and only damages the recovery of vulnerable viewers. You dont have to follow a triggering account just because they use the recovery tag.

 Ok this is something I feel quite strongly about, so I'm sorry if I come across as aggressive.  The pro-ana community on tumblr is dangerously big. As someone who used to look up pro-ana tricks and websites, this has not helped me in the slightest. It's a horrible feeling when you're looking for inspiration for recovery while in a crappy mood and half the stuff you find is pro-ana and highly triggering stuff.  As triggering content goes, I understand people wanting to express their feelings. But posts like “I feel euphoric when I don't eat and my body is shaking” is so. Fucking. Damaging. Because I've felt and often still feel those same things and saying shit like that only re-enforces that.  I think it's important for people to know that they affect others. Many young and impressionable people see these posts and internalise them.  It might seem like a little thing, but almost nothing is little in recovery. The wrong words/phrases and implications from well meaning or absentminded people hurts enough, but full on detailed posts can be so dangerous.  Not to mention, pro-ana is the single most messed up thing. This stuff is what makes people worse. And it upsets me so much that people would be proud of that, or do it intentionally.  Personally, I think pro-ana content shouldn't be allowed on tumblr. Remember when the whole “female presenting nipples” being banned thinG tumblr did a while back? Thats what should happen to pro ana because it hurts and endangers people, particularly young people.  It just makes me so upset, and uncomfortable as well. We should be lifting each other up. Those who suffer or have suffered from an ED should understand how detrimental this is to a person's mental state and use this understanding to promote recovery and mental wellbeing.  If you see any pro-ana content, please block and report it.

My stand on “pro-ana” 
 I don't know if anyone cares enough to read this, but I want to get this off my chest, as I've seen a lot of posts about this topic floating around. Please remember before cursing me out, this is just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me.  
 You are not pro-ana if  
you're posting or reblogging tips
you're posting or reblogging thinspo
you're answering asks 
 You are pro-ana if  
you wish this mental illness upon someone else
you tell people they are fat and should starve themselves 
you actively encourage other people to develop an eating disorder 
you think eating disorders are a good thing and more people should have one 
 I have never seen anyone in this community do the things I consider pro-ana on here. We know that we are sick and I bet you my green tea collection that there is nobody on here that wishes this upon anyone else.  


 Disagree. If you reblog unhealthy tips, you are sharing them with your followers. That is spreading that specific mindset and you never know who is vulnerable, or already pushing their body to its absolute limit. Asks are the same. Don't share tips, calorie limits, etc. Especially because these will be seen directly by a specific other person. Tl;dr don't be an ass and make other people's disorders worse. Intention doesn't mean SHIT in that situation, impact does. “Oh I wouldn't wish this on anyone else but hey here's a way to lose  lbs in a week just chop off your legs” 

 this just in: ana tips are literally just pro ana tips

I also support those who choose recovery and heavily encourage that. I had been using both pro Ana and pro recovery tags in my post, but will be refraining from recovery tags in certain posts. Make no mistake; I am pro recovery. Certain posts, such as thinspo however, do not belong on the feeds of those trying to recover. Therefore, in certain posts, recovery tags will no longer be used.

People who run this sort of blog are also unfortunately fond of tagging their (usually extremely triggering!) content with something like pro recovery or recovery positive- as if that makes it any better or less pro-ed. Rendering tags similar to those, which could reasonably be a good place to put or look for actual recovery content, useless and actively harmful for recovering people. Stop pretending what you're doing is okay. A tag like that doesn't change anything about you or your content.

When people share their personal stories and struggles (rather than just endless reblogs), I get to know them and care about how their lives go. I'm not going to share a list of blog names because I invariably miss someone out and then feel terrible, but it doesn't take much looking around, looking at who likes my posts, etc to see who I interact with. When I first joined tumblr, the edulting tag was just starting, so anyone who's ever posted under that tag and is still active here is probably one of my tumblr buddies.

It can cause relapses. it can make second guess recovery. It's very easy to just not type one of the recovery tags when you're about to post something. I'm not attacking or calling out anybody. I'm just asking to please not post things that are ”bonespo” “thinspo” “ana recipes” or anything else PRO eating disorder, in tags that people in recovery or people wanting to recover are in. it can bring disordered behavior back and encourage it, even if you arnt intentionally encouraging eating disorders. It's very inconsiderate and cruel and harmful. Please stop. Pro recovery for others is not putting thinspo in a recovery tag.  Honestly. It's so annoying having to swim through proana bullshit because bitches can't keep to their own fucking tags. Now all of us trying to get better are forced to see their shit!

people who are struggling with an eating disorder often look a lot like people who don't, and it's a really harmful misconception that you can determine someone's health based on how they look.

to those who are considering asking for help: there is no body criteria, threshold of behaviors, age, or level of functioning you need to be at to have an eating disorder or to get the help that you need. if you are wondering whether your behaviors are “bad enough” or if you are “sick enough” to get help, YOU ARE.

Doc ID: 14407, distribution: 1.0 ; Ok so good news! The snuzpod fits, but my exit from the bed is now even tinier and more awkward than it was previously. If you can't tell from the photo, I'm also under the sloping roof so I can't stand upright when I get out of bed. Now we have to decide what to do with the Moses basket which has been living at the end of our bed - providing useful storage as you can see. We don't need two baby sleeping spaces. (I see you social services, we only take ONE baby!) If the Moses basket goes, the snuzpod could live at the end of the bed when we don't have a baby, although it's taller and longer so might be too much in the way. Conclusion: we need more storage space for baby equipment

I really want to write posts about my last therapy session and the end of the one before but no time 😩 I will never again think taking just one newborn for a foster placement is busy. And if I ever even think about taking three siblings, I need someone to bash me over the head because I think it would finish me off. We are just about surviving with two, and they are the most darling children but have been through some hideousness which makes me want to scoop them up and run away with them so that they have absolutely no chance of being sent back to that situation.

But also I am looking forward to being able to sit down for a moment here and there through the day. We have plans to meet up next week so I can have a little cuddle with her again. It's very quiet sitting in the lounge without the oxygen machine rumbling away in the corner. H wants us to switch it on just to keep ourselves company 😂. Isn't oxygen therapy a Thing? Maybe I should try it. I went out for a run this evening, but only remembered halfway through eating tea that my stomach is never happy running straight after a meal. So I went for my run anyway and my stomach wasn't happy, but I made it round. My running form is just going down down down but I'm kind of resigned to it for now. My time to run will come round again.

I wanted to text T and for her to tell me it was ok, that would have been the easy way out. If I'd had one of the girls with me, I'd have had got fish and chips for them no problems. So I tried to imagine a combination of what T would say if I did text her and then also imagine that I have my own inner child with me and what would she like. That helped me have compassion for myself and my needs.  Fish and chips now eaten. The baby loves the sand! She has eaten quite a lot of it and improved her crawling and climbing techniques. Some people on the promemade behind me stopped to watch her explorations and exclaim over how cute she is.

It felt a big thing. I have only driven twice in the last three months since lockdown and I haven't been out anywhere on my own apart from runs and walks locally. I've quite enjoyed the small life that we've been pushed into by lockdown, and now I'm having to reacclimatise to venturing back out into the big world. Of course once I got out of the door, it felt ok. Trying to get my head round organising everything to leave the house was the hard bit, and if I'd have been going on my own, I'd have put it off and put it off. Anyway, it's done now and hopefully next time will be easier. (I did have a large glass of wine to celebrate when I got home)

Doc ID: 14824, distribution: 0.32900645620150804 ; Question: What is adoption transitions? Answer: When a child is moving from their foster home and family to the adoptive home and family. It's a structured process that's designed to gradually build an emotional bridge between the two families to help the child start to transfer their attachment from the foster family to the adoptive family. It also helps the adopting parents get to know the child and experience what their life is like with the foster family. So the adopters basically come for gradually increasing periods of time and at different times of day to experience all parts of the child's routine. Today they've been here from .am until .pm. Yesterday they were here from pm to pm. Tomorrow it's am-.pm. It usually lasts about two weeks, and the second week is based more at the adopters house with increasing amounts of time spent there.

We're all in love with them already. Can't deny I'm excited at the prospect of having my life back though.

 On Mother's Day  
 To those of you hurt by this made-up holiday. 
 To those who did not get the loving mothers you deserved when you were kids. 
 To those who are involuntarily estranged from their mothers, whether due to circumstances she could or could not control. 
 To those who are voluntarily estranged from their mothers, because her toxicity was finally too much to bear. 
 To those whose mothers are gravely ill or have died. 
 To those who are mothers of children who have died. 
 To those who are mothers of children in utero who didn't survive gestation or delivery, despite being very much wanted. 
 To those who gave up a child for adoption and wonder sometimes, even if without any regrets. 
 To those who made the right choice for their lives at that time and ended a pregnancy, but still feel sad about it, about what could have been, even if they don't regret the choice. 
 To those who so very much want to be mothers but their bodies are not cooperating and every period feels like a fundamental failure. 
 To those who hate(d) being pregnant and/or the infant stage. 
 To those who are on seemingly endless wait lists to adopt a child but have not been matched yet. 
 To those who foster a child only to see the child returned to his or her unstable biological family. 
 To those struggling with their being involuntarily drafted into the Mommy Wars and Pinterest Olympics about how to be a Good Mom TM and constantly feeling like a failure for any choice they make, no matter how hard they try, because it's never Good Enough TM. 
 To the mothers who don't (yet) love or even recognize the bodies they now have, after pregnancy and delivery. 
 To those with postpartum depression, or anxiety, or depression, or any other mood disorder and still keep up with most or some of the endless tasks of being a mother. 
 To those who have children but honestly sometimes hate being permanently stuck in the seemingly most exhausting, painful, sacrificial, repetitive, boring, disgusting job that they can't escape, and then the overwhelming guilt about feeling that way. 
 To those whose children are estranged, lost to drugs or a toxic significant other, or for mistakes that the mothers made and can't fix. 
 To those whose children are fathered by men who are not equal to the task of parenthood and leave the burden on the mothers. 
 To the voluntarily and the involuntarily single mothers. 
 To the mothers struggling with joint custody arrangements and putting on a brave and gracious face for the sake of their children's mental health. 
 To those who care for children that are not their own, whether as teachers or the significant others of parents, or aunties in all but blood, but English fails to offer an adequate name for your role, nor a holiday to honor you. 
 To those who care for our children so some of us can work. 
 To those separated from their children by immigration status. 
 To all those hurt by this made-up holiday. 
 I see you. 
 I see your pain.  I share it.   
 I love you.   
 I hope you find some modicum of peace on this holiday.  Take care of yourself.  Take care of each other.

Answer: They would have to put them between multiple families and then organise for them to have contact together on a regular basis. I know someone in my town who fostered baby triplets. Although we are only approved for two babies, in a specific situation like that we could be flexible as I think they would try and keep the babies together if at all possible.

as the youngest child in a big family, everyone took care of me. 

i'm used to just watching out for myself, meeting my own needs, and doing what i want on my schedule. 

it was a huge adjustment to constantly pay attention to another living beings needs, hunger/potty cues, and mannerisms. setting things/time aside for her, although different, has been very enjoyable at the end of the day. 

i love her snuggles, her zoomies, the way her eyes light up when she knows it's almost meal time, the way she gnaws at her teething toys, the way her tail wags, her tippy taps across the floor, and the way she twitches and barks in her sleep

when i'm mad at her i'm only acting like it… deep down i think everything she does is adorable but i can't let her think that 😅😅

 months ago i would have read this and been like “ok…. it's a dog Amanda….. 👀👀👀👀relax”

but NOW i TOTALLY get it. i can try, but i don't think i can even imagine the feeling of love a mother has for her own human child. i think my heart would explode on a daily basis😭😭

anyway, happy weekend! stay safe, enjoy, and also remember the people who didn't have independence on America's Independence Day… and the people who still don't.

I can now sign appropriate greetings for any time of day to anyone with a three letter name. Good morning Liz! Good afternoon Ash! I can also introduce two people with three letter names and explain if they are hearing or deaf.  The baby has been more settled than the last couple of days which has meant I have not had to spend the whole day jiggling and snuggling her. We went out for a little walk for our daily exercise allowance, but I got a bit freaked by all the closed shops and all the people around (it's hard to pass at a m distance on a narrow pavement with a pram) and hustled back to the safety of our quiet road and our house.

I'm currently fostering a cat and I am going to have such a hard time letting her go. Answer: We let them go because we have to. There's no way we could do it if we had a choice about it. Saying goodbye is absolutely the hardest part of fostering. It is one of the most emotionally painful things I have ever done, and I've done it  times now. Sometimes I cope reasonably well with the grief, and sometimes it absolutely flattens me for weeks and weeks. There's been times I've felt I can't put myself through this pain ever again, but so far I've always gone back. We always have a break after a baby has moved on, and we don't go back on the list for a new placement until we've got ourselves emotionally back on track. (I know this was an old ask and I hope you managed ok to say goodbye to your foster cat if that time has passed)

We are all going away for a few nights in a weeks time, it's a good job we have a seven seater car so everyone will fit in, but not sure where the luggage is going to go 😳 Yesterday we had a lovely Easter Sunday and then because Easter Monday is a bank holiday for us too, we have had a chilled out day today. I did squeeze a run in over midday naptime. Then I squeezed two  minute power naps in through the afternoon (plus I've been wearing my pyjamas since pm!!). A friend cooked a lovely meal and dropped it round for us this evening. I feel so blessed not having to do any cooking or plan any meals for now.

Doc ID: 16003, distribution: 1.0 ; Baby sleep anon… I have so many questions! I got your second message, thanks. So I'm wondering, how long does she nap at the second nap in total, whether it's two short sleeps or one long one? Also how does she fall asleep at bedtime  - do you put her down awake or does she nod off on her bedtime milk, do you sit with her till she's asleep etc? What about daytime naps, where and how does she get to sleep for those? Do you swaddle her, put her in a sleeping bag, just put a blanket over her etc? Does she have a dummy/pacifier? Does she sleep in your room? Are you with her in the daytime or is she in daycare? Do you offer her a bottle every time she wakes in the night, and if so approx how much milk does she drink each time? How much does she drink at her daytime feeds? And lastly, and this is really one of the most important things. You said you feel desperate. Is that because she used to follow a routine and now she doesn't, or is it because you're exhausted and just want a good nights sleep, or because some book or another says she should be sleeping better than she is, or is it some other reason I haven't mentioned?  It's not so easy to do this via anon message, so if you wanted to send it off-anon or via chat, I could give you a private answer. Else send me another anon message with the above info and then I'll write it all in the answer to the first one! Or if you don't want to go in that much detail, just let me know and I can just give you some general tips x Ps it's nearly midnight here so I'm off to sleep but I'll try and get back to you tomorrow

The  yr old slept  hours straight through, and the newborn woke every  hours for feeds but then settled back to sleep afterwards. No complaints about that here. It was a shock to us to all be up at am though, none of us have been out of bed that early for many months. Even d and d got up and came out of their rooms at the first cries because they wanted to play with the babies.

Will you get to visit her ever after she leaves? Do you like the adopters? My daughter is around the same age and I have felt so sad and nervous for you guys all week.  Answer: Aw thankyou, thoughtful anon. So many questions…. let me answer them one by one.Baby is doing great with the transition so far. As we have progressed, she has had some periods of being unsettled when the adopters and me are all around, as she can sense something is changing and she is confused by who she wants and the different pulls on her emotions.When she came to stay with us, it was as a foster placement, so we always knew she would be moving on sooner or later. The government target is  weeks from court order for placement to final decision, so we had a rough idea she'd be with us  months or so, but you just never know. Things can change, she could have moved much earlier to a foster-to-adopt placement.Yes we have some scheduled visits after she leaves. Recent research has shown that contrary to what standard practice used to be, foster carers visiting the child soon after placement helps the child settle in their new placement. It reassures them that their attachment figures haven't abandoned them, while they are still building their new attachment with their adopters. Also the adopters comforting them through the grief the baby naturally feels and expresses after seeing their precious foster carers helps build the baby's attachment bond with the adopters.The adopters are lovely. We really like them. They are quite young and so full of energy, warmth and enthusiasm. We have got on with them really well and hope that after baby moves to them, and after we have done all our scheduled visits, they will still keep in touch with us.Thankyou for thinking of us, it is really a difficult and draining time with a lot of mixed emotions xx

The babies had a bit of a lie in and I didn't have to get up with them till .am which was nice. After all the feeding and changing was done, we sat at the front of the house for a while where it was still cool and shady. Nice for the babies. Then I had my friend over for birthday brunch. It was good to see her. We usually have a swim and then a good catch up in the spa twice a week, but she is still recovering from her breast cancer surgery so isn't back to the gym yet. I miss my spa buddy. d and then d went off to do various things with their friends, and I gave d a lift to her friend's house. She could have got the bus but really I wanted an excuse to sit in my air conditioned car!! With both the babies contained in car seats!!  Late afternoon I went round to see another friend. I'm really limited with what I can do with the babies so it's mostly walks and chats with friends. Unfortunately I got them all loaded into the double pram, the oxygen switched to the portable cylinder, changing bag attached etc, and then realised the pram had a flat tyre 🙄. So I had to unload them all again, put the little baby in the single travel buggy because the proper single pram was in H's car in town, put the bigger baby in the wrap on my back, and finally off we went. It felt so good to walk. The temperature had cooled briefly so it was a good time to go. I've spend a lot of time sitting on the floor with the babies so just getting out and stretching my legs was lovely. I did have to give them both a cool bath and myself a cold shower when we got home though. H has got stranded in London because the trains have all been cancelled due to the heat 😭. So he is getting an Uber home. It's a loooooooong way. He assures me his work will pay. I hope so. He'll be home in the early hours of the morning. I hope his Uber driver hasn't been driving all day already. I'm really scared/ worried/ anxious/paranoid about people falling asleep at the wheel and crashing. I would have rather H get a hotel room for tonight and come home tomorrow. I'm praying he makes it safely back. I'm off to do the final feed of the night and attempt to sleep now. Tomorrow should be cooler according to the weather forecast. Maybe the babies will actually be able to wear some clothes! That would be fun.

Answer: I didn't really because it was before it really became a “thing”, so I had a baby bjorn baby carrier which I used for going out and about when it was easier than the pram, but they're not so popular either now (they don't hold the baby's legs in the best position apparently).

Good things have happened today. I went for a lovely run this morning, while the frost was still on the ground and the sun was shining and was home by .am to get on with my day. I thought I would spend the whole day after that in comfy clothes on the sofa, watching Greys anatomy and organising a photo book. But as I came home from my run, I discovered H hadn't taken his car to work, so I offered to take d out driving in her free period. We went to the gym car park and spent an hour reversing in and out of spaces. She definitely improved, which was encouraging for her and rewarding for me. Then I got home from that and found the oven had terminally broken 😫 so a mad scramble to buy a new one while all the black Friday deals are still on. H wouldn't answer his phone, which made me really grumpy and unable to move on to the next thing till I'd got through to him. I won't go on because it's b o r i n g but the day carried on being meh, even through our annual tradition of Christmas bauble buying 😭. The girls still insist we carry out this tradition but then actually have minimal interest in choosing a bauble and basically grab the nearest one so they can go and look at iPhones in the tech department. I think it's time to change the tradition up a bit. Although I can't tell how much of my negative feeling is due to my overall negative mood. If anyone wants to cheer me up, please go for it. Send some smiles this way 🙃

Trying to coax a reluctant  yr old to do schoolwork while being unable to log in to flipping Microsoft Teams for her English lesson despite following the exact instructions sent by the teacher. Having to get the husband to stop working so that same child can have the laptop for the ill fated Microsoft teams lesson. Trying to keep the baby entertained while screaming at the laptop for not working. Are we in some sort of computer poverty that we only have one laptop for the whole family? It has always been fine for us up till this point. Stupid pandemic.  Then my neighbour popped round to borrow a board game and as I was reaching for it above my head, it fell out and emptied its contents all over the floor and then sushi go party fell on top of it and emptied its contents all over the first game. The resulting crash woke up the baby who screamed. And my poor neighbour was stood waiting at my back door listening to the whole thing on the baby monitor in the kitchen. Second day in a row I haven't had time to eat lunch and have just grabbed a couple of ricecakes on the go. Have to take that as a red flag for eating disorder recovery and need to make sure I eat lunch tomorrow. Doing something three days in a row is often the tipping point for it becoming a new normal.  Looking on the positive side, I'm supposed to be speaking at my church small group this evening and I have been so busy I haven't had time to stress about it so that's good, I guess. I'll just have to wing it. Bit out of my comfort zone.

Answer: We foster as a family so it's always been very important to us that our kids are on board with it. They love the babies we foster and they're quite hands on in caring for them. There have been some really hard times for them because we foster, but also some really wonderful times. I think they have grown a lot through their fostering experiences and they see it overall as a positive thing.

The days feels like they pass with very little windows for me-time. It's good to remind myself there were little bits of it here and there. I have lots of enjoyable things I'd like to spend time doing and I feel sad that I fit so few of them into each day. The baby is unhappy. She cries most of her awake time. I'm holding on to the fact she is nearly six weeks and I hope she's read all the books that say it should get better after that. I know it will get better eventually. I've looked after lots of babies that were unhappy at this age, but there seemed always something to explain it - drug withdrawal, medical issues, prenatal trauma. Of course all babies in foster care have trauma from separation from their birth parents, so maybe some of it is just that coming out. Or maybe she's just an unsettled baby. It's easier to cope with when there's a reason that you know about.

Beautiful madness. We visited my in-laws and saw our niece for the first time since she was walking. I went all the way to the Shetland Islands for a weekend to run the most northerly park run in the UK. More madness. While we were up there I saw puffins for the first time. Amazing. The baby and I went on a mini-retreat to the seaside and I had a bit of a breakthrough thinking about therapy things. I went away with H for two nights and we stayed in a cow-themed room. The baby and I had a lovely day out to a country house and saw penguins. My sister had a festival in her garden for my BIL's big birthday and we all went up for the weekend. My mum and I did one of the most scenic parkruns in the UK along the shore of the lake. My teenagers had birthdays, grew up, didn't want to have days out, didn't tell me when they would be home, stayed up all night on their gadgets, slept in till midday, and did all the other things teenagers are supposed to do in the summer holidays which drive their parents mad. I ❤️ them. The baby and I had a daytrip to meet up with @raspberryrose and her baby, which was fab. A sudden heavy rain shower put a rapid end to our picnic but then it passed and we spend the afternoon pram pushing in glorious sunshine. I tag @raspberryrose , @eattodefeat and @productivetimewasting if you want to join in.

The adopters came at am as per the schedule so they were here when baby woke up. Luckily she is not an early riser. We spent the morning together and I failed to eat breakfast. They went and my friend came round for lunch. T texted me to ask how the eating was going, and I replied “Can I just say 'fine' because the reality is too complicated to explain?” which really should be read as 'not fine'. Friend brought soup (sweet potato and coconut daal by Glorious) and we had it with some bread. I finally managed to get hold of someone at school to talk to about d, so at .pm we trailed down to school. d was at home today having a mental health day, following some hard core crying last night. The meeting went well and hopefully helped d a little bit and we made a plan to get her through the next two weeks till the holiday. I cooked a sausage casserole for tea and served it in bowls with crusty bread. It only really made four decent portions so I had a bowl of roasted (baked) veggies and spinach with tahini. I need to get my act together with eating. Mostly I just think “T is going to kill me next week” which is an unhelpful thought coming from little-me who doesn't want to take responsibility for her own eating. This evening I've been doing endless online shopping for a) food and b) things on the holiday kit list and c) things on the holiday kit list that are cheaper to buy on amazon. Interspersed with that I took d for another practice drive, she is getting less terrifying to be in a car with and it is good I can see her progress even if she does still scare me. Driving instructors are heroes. I think I said that before. Thankfully no one had a crisis tonight, because I have nothing left to give anyone. I hope I sleep better tonight too.

Doc ID: 16034, distribution: 0.28221789015208626 ; Question: why does baby get contact with mom if shes in foster care? is it only for babies or for older foster kids too?  Answer: All children have the right to a family life through the Human Rights Act. This means even if they are brought into foster care, they have the legal right to continue to have a relationship with their birth family unless or until there is good reason to stop this. This applies to all children of all ages. When children have arranged contact with their birth family, this right to family life is protected (even though arranged contact may not be what everyone views as 'family life').Baby will continue to have supervised contact with her birth mum until a ruling is made by the court abut her future. Imagine if there was no contact, and then the court found six months later (the standard minimum length of family court proceedings in the UK) that mum was able to safely parent her baby. By then mum and baby wouldn't have seen each other for  months and the relationship would have been severely damaged. Contact can also form a very useful part of the parenting assessment, which contributes to the court's final decision.Newborn babies typically have relatively large amounts of contact with their birth parents -  hours, three or four times a week. This helps preserve their relationship in the critical early months of life until a court ruling has been made. Older children in care of the local authority have varying amounts of contact depending on the circumstances, but very rarely as frequent as newborns.

Doc ID: 15017, distribution: 0.2788126570149054 ; Question: I would like a point of view from somewhere that's not the USA. What are your views on adoption when there is a small chance and also not of the child getting adopted. Would you be more for waiting it out and see if the birth family can do it ?  With much more known about adoption trauma than say  years ago, are adoptive parents now more well informed ? Answer: In the UK it's up to the courts to decide. We have task foster care, which is short term while a decision over reunification is made - that's the foster care that we do. Then there's permanence foster care. This is when the child won't be adopted but will stay in long term foster care, ideally with the same family until they're + and will likely have some ongoing contact with their birth families throughout. Then there's adoption, where usually there isn't any contact with the birth family. There isn't much space for waiting it out and seeing if the birth family can get themselves into a position to have their child back. They get a basic  weeks. If things are more complex it can be extended but only with a plan for what that extra time is needed for. After the (+) weeks, if the no one in the extended birth family looks in a place for the child to live with them imminently and adoption looks unlikely because of their age or situation, the child will go into permanence foster care. My understanding is it's done like this because a child needs some certainty about their future and who they will live with for the rest of their childhood.I think adoptive parents are much more aware of trauma than they were  years ago. However it's one thing knowing about it in theory and quite another having it playing out in your family day after day. Here in the UK, adopters are encouraged to be very open with their adoptive child from day . To stay in touch with the foster carers if they can and talk about how they looked after the child before they came to live with the adoptive family. And to talk about the situation with the birth family. Each child that moves to adoption gets a Life Story book made by social care, which explains their personal life story from birth, even before birth, until they move to adoption or permanence foster care. This helps them make sense of their past.

Doc ID: 15514, distribution: 0.28118677956283783 ; Question: Have you ever thought about adopting one of the babies you fostered?  Answer: It has never really got to the point of us having to seriously consider that decision. Adoption is not the natural end point of fostering. Assessment to be foster carers and assessment to be adopters are generally two separate routes in the UK, so just because you've done one, doesn't mean you can automatically do the other without any further assessment. IF we fostered a baby and IF that baby became subject to a placement order (the court decided reconciliation with birth parents or relatives not an option) and IF there were no adopters nationwide ready within a few months who could be matched with our baby…. then we would consider adoption. However if we were to adopt, that would take up our spare room and we would have to stop fostering. And our heart is really for fostering, for standing in that gap for a child. So that's something we would bear in mind too.

What is the best and worst thing about fostering babies? And did you choose to foster babies only? Answer: Thankyou ❤️The best thing is that I love babies and I get to use that in a job where I can be at home for my family and also make a real difference to someone's future. I'm good at caring for babies and it comes very naturally to me. So all in all it's a very satisfying situation all round.The worst thing is having to say goodbye to them when they move on. I think I should say that's the hardest thing, rather than the worst thing, because ultimately it's the best thing for the baby - moving on to their new and permanent future, whether that's reunification with their birth parents or moving into adoption with their forever family. But there's no way round it being hard, both for the baby and for us.Yes we chose to foster only babies, because our spare room has only a cot in it. So we can only take a child who would be ok sleeping in a cot, or obviously the Moses basket in our bedroom. We don't exclusively foster newborns but that is usually who gets placed with us. We've had two babies in the past who were both a few months old when they came to us.

Answer: Yes and yes!H has been working from home at a desk in our bedroom for two weeks now, and thankfully the weather has been nice so d and d have been outside sitting in the garden a lot of the day, while d holes up in the bedroom she shares with d. It's a lot easier being on lockdown with three teenagers than three small children though so I'm very grateful for that. I'm quite enjoying the family time, the only thing that drives me mad is I can spend almost all day trying to catch up with myself on housework because as fast as I clean and tidy, someone messes things up again. Depending on how bad the previous night with the baby has been affects how much patience I have for things.Our family motto during this lockdown time has been “extend your grace” which for us just means, give a little extra, take an extra moment before you shout back, have a little extra patience, be a little extra generous, react a little less.

Answer: Haha it's a great idea in theory but I think in reality trying to get them to do everything the way I like it would be more stressful than just doing it myself!!Sometimes we have struggles but when I'm calm and not exhausted, I know they are actually pretty good most of the time.

The pair of them often take her for walks in the pram together. d mostly avoids the current baby, she was really attached to the last baby and really upset when she moved on, so I think she now “hates babies” as a defence against getting hurt again.

Doc ID: 16090, distribution: 0.11233633599131958 ; Thurs  Feb  The last thing H said to me this morning before he went to work was “Why don't you just have a restful day today.” It seemed quite possible at am this morning, with the whole day stretching ahead of me.  I got a text from d in her bed on the floor below me two minutes later that said “Can you please give my meme more orijomorth tgeyveewltvgyer.” Luckily I could translate this as a half asleep request for more oromorph. Her ears are still really painful. I went for an  minute run, which felt hard but actually went ok. I think it will be my last run in my old shoes. d had her driving test this morning and much to her disappointment, she didn't pass 😭. The things she failed on were all related to being too cautious. She isn't a particularly cautious driver usually but I think she was over compensating for it being her test. There were tears afterwards as she thought it had gone ok.  Early afternoon my supermarket delivery arrived. It was a mess, quite a lot of stuff I'd ordered wasn't there. But on the plus, quite a lot of stuff I hadn't ordered was there. So we made a profit of  packs of brioche,  packs of krispie cakes,  bags of crisps and  eggs. I rang the helpline and they came back out an hour later with all the missing stuff.  By the time I'd sorted that out and started cooking the tea and tended to d's medical needs, I was rather hoping my pm tutee would cancel, but she didn't. So we spent an hour revising probability trees. Then finished cooking the tea. D's bf had come round to help in the consolation process so he joined us for tea. H dashed off out to meet some friends at the pub to talk about some volunteering work they all day.  I'm finally getting round to the restful part of the day, sitting on the sofa and watching last week's episode of Hunted. Ahhhh nice. I'm nibbling on dark chocolate and raspberry coated almonds which I bulk ordered online as a nutrition dense snack to help push my intake up after my long runs.  Tomorrow I am hoping for a proper restful day. All my children may make it out of the house (d has improved as the day has gone on and hopes to make it back to school tomorrow) and I may even get chance to paint the bannisters!

Doc ID: 15917, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Although I understand it completely it's so heartbreaking to read that the baby only gets  minute visits with the parents each day. That must be difficult for you as well. Sending you and your family love Answer: Yes I imagine the hardest thing for them is just not being able to hold her. Newborn babies don't do a whole lot in terms of interacting, so she used to just sleep all the way through her face to face contact anyway. But she could have cuddles with parents and smell them and hear them. Now I have to try and predict a  minute window each day when she'll be awake, so they can see her and she can hear their voices.  minutes is quite long enough for baby, she usually ends up grizzling during it anyway. By the time she's fed and burped and had a nappy change, she's not too impressed with having to stay awake for a while longer. A small benefit though is that they get to see her five days a week whereas it used to be only three when it was face to face.

 beckelstein: 

 I find it odd how the fandom focuses so much on Aang's childhood being ruined when he learned he was the Avatar at , but there's very little talk about how discovering she was the Avatar as a toddler affected Korra's life and how she was raised. But we'll circle back to that… Because this is a good starting point to talk about one of the most prevalent themes in the story, which the mainstream discussion of tends to only focus on a few characters – That is the Child Prodigy.  We'll start with the two most obvious. The ones we always talk about.  Azula.  The clearest example of your typical child prodigy (if there is anything typical about a prodigy). Azula showed early mastery of very advanced Fire-Bending techniques, and is the only Fire-Bender to use blue flames, which was intended to make her stand out amongst the other villains but is also indicative that her Fire-Bending is more pure and powerful (blue flame is produced when burning pure O or fuel without contaminant at a very high temperature).  All this lead to her being praised and favored by Ozai as a child, but as double-edged swords go, this also meant she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders to never fail, and she rarely did. Her ego matched her talent, and let's be honest she was the baddest bitch the show had ever seen. Conquering Ba Sing Se, defeating the Avatar in combat, and dropping some of the most devastating lines of dialogue in villain history; she was a force nobody wanted to reckon with.  And that become a problem for one asshole in particular…  Being jealous of his own child is just one item on a laundry list of reasons why this guy is the worst father in the history of fathers. Azula had begun to outshine him with her victories, and Ozai's maniacal ego couldn't handle that, so he left her behind to babysit the Fire Nation while he went out to burn/conquer the world, which also was her idea. And while this wasn't the only thing that aided in her demise, it certainly was the final straw which sent her spiraling down into this…  In the end Azula is a sad example of how certain unfair expectations are placed upon talented children, and the more they succeed, the more these expectations grow and weigh on the them until they either disappoint those looking down on them or surpass and embarrass their elders. It is a lose-lose situation which inevitably destroys them. There is a similar example of the child prodigy, but his story goes a little different.  Aang.  Even as a twelve/thirteen year-old boy Aang by far has the most impressive stats among any character in the Avatar universe. Basically mastering  of the  Elements in less than a year, after mastering Air by the time he is twelve (not to mention inventing his own Air-bending move, the Air scooter).  Aang is an example of a child prodigy who had too much thrust onto him at too young an age because of the talent he showed; because of this he panicked and ran away, and the world was worse off for it.  Aang/Sokka/Katara's story is all about how in times of War, responsibilities normally handled by adults are pushed onto kids who then have to grow up very fast in order to deal with it all. The message is clear. War robs the young of their childhoods.  Now, let's talk about a different kind of child prodigy. The Unacknowledged.   Yes, of course I'm talking about Toph, the greatest Earth-Bender to ever live. Because of her blindness, Toph's family tried to keep her sheltered and safe by hiding her from the world. Refusing to believe she could ever be more than helpless. Anyone who has seen the show knows that is far from the truth.  But because her potential went unseen, there were some negative effects to her personality. Initially, she resented her parents, and rebelled; which established a certain level of independence, a bad attitude, and a hot-headed streak. Over time spent with the Gaang these behaviors subsided because she finally had friends and they accepted her for who she was. By the end of the series she was fully willing to accept aid from them when she needed it, like holding on to Sokka's arm in environment where her bending couldn't help her “see”.  Toph's story is a foil to Azula's, both showed immense talent and badassery, but while recognition of Azula lead to ever-mounting pressure for her to succeed; the lack of recognition for Toph created a need for her to be acknowledged and set an undercurrent of frustration which leads to her acting out in the ways she does. The lesson to take from Toph's story is not to shelter your kid from the world out of fear for their safety, and to be open to recognizing their talents, not shun them. Next are two more Unacknowledged.  Katara and Sokka.         Their story, and the reason behind their circumstances, is one of the more complicated and nuanced ones in the series, so here we'll focus on how it fits into the subject of discussion. Because of the War, Katara was robbed not only of her mother but also of any Southern Masters to train her, and any role models Sokka could have looked up to left with his father to fight. Because of this Katara's potential and Sokka's genius went unacknowledged not due to neglect but rather due to circumstance. (Yes, I think Sokka is a genius, how many  yr olds do you know that can plan an invasion, design submarines, and spit poetry off the cuff?). This is a further example of how War robs kids of necessary childhood experiences, and these two robberies had particular effects on both Katara and Sokka's character developments. Sokka had the responsibility of protecting his home put upon him at a young age. The men of his tribe leaving prevented him from completing his rite of manhood until the Gaang ran into Bato of the Water Tribe, and early on Sokka was constantly trying to prove himself as a man and a leader. Sokka is one of the smarter characters of the series, but he rarely got credit for it until the third season. Not to mention that because he wasn't a bender he often seemed less useful than the others. The circumstances of war made his talent go unnoticed and because of that he often was unsure of himself and overcompensated to prove something. Speaking of talent going unnoticed.  Katara is definitely one of the more talented benders of the series. After training herself for years with little progress, she essentially mastered Water-Bending in a few weeks under Master Pakku. While her anger towards the Fire-Nation mostly centers around the loss of her mother, it can't be ignored that the delay in her training was a direct result of the Fire-Nations' actions.  Toph's anger and frustration vented itself as rebellion. However, the same frustration and anger is within Katara, but because she wasn't as natural a bender as Toph she sought to learn and be respected, and when that was denied to her is when that anger bubbled to the surface in some terrifying ways.  While Toph's talent went unnoticed because of her families neglect, Katara and Sokka's wasn't acknowledged because there was nobody to acknowledge it. Because of that both brother and sister wanted to prove themselves to the world.  And then there is Zuko.  I know what you're thinking. Zuko wasn't a prodigy, his Fire-Bending skill didn't catch up with Azula's until the finale and he never mastered Lightning-Bending, but this section is about the Unacknowledged. Zuko had many other talents besides Fire-Bending, he was a master swordsmen, and was able to successfully break into every secure facility he attempted in the show (which was almost every secure facility the show featured).  Unfortunately, these talents were never recognized, because the only thing the royal family cared about was bending ability (It's possible the reason he learned the sword was because he lacked skill in Fire-Bending).  As per usual with Zuko, this part of his tale is quite sad. Many can relate to being outshined by a sibling, and when it becomes all too clear that one cannot match another's talent it's quite understandable to focus on what they do excel at, but even then there is no promise of recognition for their own talent. Zuko was even mocked by his father during the solar eclipse when Ozai tried baiting him into attacking with his swords.  This lack of recognition is one of many sad aspects of Zuko's early life, but it is a definitive example of one of the hardest unacknowledged prodigy's cross to bear. The Outshone prodigy, one whose talents are never noticed because a bigger and brighter star stands in the way of such recognition, and arguably the most frustrating type mentioned here. Toph/Sokka/Katara all came from situations were there was no recognition being given to them or anyone, but Zuko had to bear watching massive amounts of praise be piled on to his sister while he and his accomplishments went by the way side. Ozai summed up the situation best.  “Azula was born lucky, Zuko was lucky to be born”  Alright now where have I been going with all this? So, far we've covered a lot of wrong ways to treat a child, whether they show talent or not, and how the circumstances of war can also take many things from children. But what happened to Korra? (Before we get into to this I should state that I like Korra, and the purpose of this is not to bash her as a character or her arc, but rather to give a little of my insight into it.) It's well established that Aang was told of his heritage too young, and that was a detriment on his development into an adult, but what would have happened if he realized his powers himself not long after he could walk? We'll never know, but we do get to see the effects it had on Korra.  When she revealed herself as the Avatar, Korra set her entire life in a new direction, and because Aang tasked the White Lotus with finding and training her that direction was out of her control. There are two key differences between Korras' and other Avatars' lives.  . She grew up in isolation on a White Lotus compound. Every Avatar before Korra we know of spent a portion of their early lives traveling the world in order to master the elements; along this journey they not only learned how to bend the other  elements, buy also many things about the  other nations and the world they are tasked to protect as a whole. By confining Korra in safety and bringing the masters to her the White Lotus deprived Korra of this opportunity to learn and grow and understand the world and the people within in. It also deprived her of learning modern bending styles until she reached Republic City.  While this might have kept Korra safe from the Red Lotus, it grew within her a naiveté about how the world worked, and because of this when she actually did venture out into the world she was terribly unprepared for it. .  She was trained and mastered  of the elements by the time she was . Most Avatars don't know they have this power until they reach  and then they spend several years learning to control it. Korra's natural talent in the bending lead to her training being expedited not by necessity like Aang's, but due to her talent and eagerness. Korra excelled at the physical part of being the Avatar and because of this by the time she reached maturity she had become over-confident in her abilities and true to what her Fire-Bending master said in Ep. she lacked restraint. I'm not saying her bending isn't great, but rather because it is so great it's her go-to solution to anything, and she enjoys that so she uses it with enthusiastic gusto and not a lot of thinking before striking.  This overconfidence coupled with her naiveté of the world is what lead to many of her rash decisions and actions, most of which had negative consequences, and I believe are the reason behind some fan are dissatisfied with her. Aang had been almost the complete opposite, even by the age of twelve he was an experienced world traveler and an incredibly humble guy.   Some may have been dissatisfied by these character decisions, but they served a purpose, they are only the beginning of her arc. The internal challenge Korra must overcome through  seasons is to humble herself before the world, and learn from it. This was finally achieved in the th season when the metal poisoning in her body forces her to face others in the world as equals, only then had she completed her journey. And why did it all go this way? Because she is a very unique child prodigy, what she demonstrates in the first episode of LOK would be akin to a toddler playing the violin or hitting a three-pointer; she could bend  elements close to just after learning to walk. That is the kind of prodigious talent rarely seen because it is mostly impossible. How does a rational person handle a child like that?  It's a tough question, and something this essay has been circling around the whole time. Each example here is the wrong way to handle talented and different children, but what is the right way? As always look to Iroh.  Who treated his surrogate son Zuko with both respect and compassion.   Unlike Toph's parents, Iroh worried over Zuko's well being, but also allowed him to be independent, make his own decisions, and take his own risks.  Unlike the Nomad Leaders, he didn't want Zuko weighed down by his position in the world and the responsibility that came with, and always encouraged him relax and take advantage of the moment.  Unlike Ozai, Iroh would always be there to support Zuko in his victories and his failures. Iroh shows him the right path but does not force him down it.  And even after Zuko betrayed and abandoned him.  Iroh was never angry with him, and embraced him upon his return.  He wanted Zuko to grow and be a better man. Even if Zuko wasn't a prodigy like his sister.  And that is the answer here. The way to raise a prodigy is the same way anyone should raise any child. Love, Support, a Guiding Hand rather than a Forceful Shove, Recognition of What Makes Them Unique, and Forgiveness When They Falter. The problem comes along when you start treating children differently because you see them as different or special. All children are different, all children are special. Kids are kids, and they all deserve a proper childhood.

Doc ID: 15219, distribution: 1.0 ; Penultimate day of holiday: It rained hard all morning so we had a lazy time in the cottage. The rain eased mid-afternoon so we decided to go to a local beach that had a cafe (bribed the teenagers out with the promise of chips). I ran  miles along the coastal path and the rest of the fam came in the car, but when we arrived at said beach, the cafe WAS CLOSED!! So, we piled back in the car and drove to “our” beach (near our cottage), where the cafe WAS open, there WAS phone reception, and the sun WAS shining. Don't know why we even tried to go anywhere else!  Also got an email from social services to say that the baby that potentially had been coming to us next week is now going to a residential unit with parent. Part sad and part relieved. Quite enough to focus on with current baby starting weaning, d and d going back to school, and d heading off to university. I feel like life has opened up again without the prospect of every spare minute being filled with caring for a sick baby in addition to everything else. Although had they come to us, I would have thrown myself into the babycare and loving % and I would have made it work.

Doc ID: 15081, distribution: 1.0 ; Today has been a Good Day. Such a relief after a couple of weeks of feeling mostly blah. I think it's because my cold seems to have gone and I've been busy today. My Get Up and Go seems to have come back! I had another foster carer come round for coffee first thing. She's a very new foster carer and I'm mentoring her, so we had a chat about all things fostering and that was lovely. It's great to share things you feel passionate about. Then baby and I hustled out to our baby sensory class, which the baby loves. When we got home, she went down for a nap and I went out for a run. H working from home has some benefits! I ran k along my favourite route and it felt so good to feel up to running again. Two weeks of feeling rubbish with a cold and a cough has meant I haven't done any running for a while. Came home and baby had woken up from her nap, so I've been entertaining her and trying to send a few emails this afternoon, as well as chatting with d - it is lovely to have her around again. It's been great to feel I have enough energy to bustle around doing these things and just feel better in myself. On the downside I haven't really eaten any meals so far today, due to the hustling around. That's not good. I've made a macaroni cheese and broccoli bake for tea so I will definitely eat some of that. Eating hasn't been so good over the last two weeks due to my loss of appetite through being ill and also the low mood I've had. I need to get myself back on track before it spirals into anything worse. Maybe I'll mention it to my therapist tomorrow, although I don't want to get into a big discussion about it (too much else to talk about). I'll just tell her it's not been great but I'm going to make an effort to make it better this week.

Doc ID: 15319, distribution: 0.2995791182543372 ; Question: How long are the babies allowed to stay with you? Can you only have babies stay with you? Answer: We only take babies because our only spare room has a cot in it and it's not big enough for a single bed. The babies stay with us until the court process has been completed and they either return to their birth parents or they move to an adoptive family. That's usually between  months and a year. About  years ago, the UK government set a  week target from the initial care order to the final court order, and although extensions often have to be applied for, that has speeded the whole process up. The first couple of babies we fostered we had for nearer  years each, and that is a long time for a baby to be in temporary foster care rather than with their forever family, bonding and attaching.

Do all of you (your husband, you, and your daughters) know the same things about the foster babies? Answer: Yes my daughters love the foster babies. d likes them best when they're a little bit older and more interactive,  months+, but d and especially d are very caring and helpful with the babies.I usually know the most about the babies because I am the one who attends all the meetings, takes the phone calls, receives the paperwork etc. I try and tell H everything but naturally there's details he misses out on. The girls, we usually tell them the outline and the reasons the baby is in care, and the thoughts on the future court process and likely outcome, but I don't tell them every last detail. Partly because I don't want to put that burden of having to keep all that information confidential on them. Their friends naturally ask them questions, and it's hard to negotiate those conversations and remember what you can and can't say, so it's easier for them to just not know too many details.

Came home and cried a little bit.  [insert various other baby things I can't write about] I texted T my weight and she replied that she was glad it was stable, with an emoji of a horse. A horse?? She put in brackets (stable?). I told her that was such terrible use of an emoji I think it was actually illegal. I'm sad I don't get to see her tomorrow because of [things]. We have had to reschedule for Thursday. But at least then it'll only be a few days till I see her again on Tuesday next week. I survived another drive with d this evening. She is doing ok but being so powerless in the passenger seat is still a terrifying experience for me. For some reason I decided to go sober for October. It's therefore the wrong month to be trying to teach my  year old to drive. I. Need. Wine. I also need to go to bed now but I'm playing permanent catch up watching The Circle. Any programme that's on more than once a week I can't keep up with. I don't even know how many episodes behind I am!  Right off to get bedtime snackage and set an early alarm for tomorrow 😴

Doc ID: 14297, distribution: 1.0 ; We are in our holiday cottage! We are unpacked! The supermarket delivery arrived! We're connected to the wifi! We cooked a meal! And now we're all in bed. Totally winning at this holiday life. Toddler saw free range chickens and nearly went out of her mind with excitement. I'm pretty certain this is the furthest she has ever been away from her place of birth. We tried to explain the concept of holiday to her but obviously she is only one year old so probably had no idea what we were talking about. Hopefully because we are all here with her and lots of her familiar items are here too, this won't feel like a traumatic move but a fun one. Hard to know what sense she makes of it. Our only stress on arrival was there wasn't a travel cot in the cottage and it said there would be. I messaged the homeowner to ask about it and she did bring one round but she said to us “oh I just have a booking for  adults here”. I literally had tried to add the two babies onto the Airbnb booking as soon as we knew they would be with us, and when I hit submit it said I didn't need to do that because the price wouldn't change, just to message the host and let them know. So I did that two weeks ago and told her that we would need to use the travel cot please. She was really nice about bringing it round but I felt mildly irritated that she implied it was our fault when I had actually told her and she just hadn't paid proper attention to her messages. Anyway, no complaints now. The travel cot is set up at the end of our bed and the pop up Moses basket is set up next to my side of the bed and let's hope the babies sleep well. Goodnight all!

_______________
First, i'd like to say that I know that the news can be overwhelming and traumatic for many (myself included). It's not something we like to scroll through on our spare time. Social media presents as a very useful tool for us especially now. We're here to spread awareness- not to fear monger - and to create and inspire change. If it makes us feel uncomfortable that's a good sign there's something we should probably attend to
_______________
I've made a decision to acknowledge all this information and to use my fear, sadness, and frustration as raw energy to transform into something more productive and helpful
_______________
“what can i do? what can i do? what do i do?” At this moment, I don't know how else to help other than to extend my services and fundraise as much as I can. There's only so much money we can donate as individuals so I thought i would reach out to my community. Until the end of June, % of my earnings from my “Stress and Anxiety Support meal plan” will go directly to multiple organizations supporting the people of Yemen during this time. It's really not much, but it's the least I can do
_______________
The meal plan is designed with key nutrients that tend to get depleted when we are stressed/anxious including zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins, which aren't a bad idea to include in  your diet esp. during a global pandemic
______________
If you're not in the position to buy a meal plan ($)/donate, please keep spreading the word! And if you want to repost, please repost directly from @soyouwanttotalkabout and give them credit for their amazing work. There's also a link in my bio with a lot of resources about what's going on in Yemen and how you can help - even with no money
_______________
Again… thank you for giving me this platform to speak on. I know it's probably not what you came to this page for but health and wellness extends to all humans and these are causes I deeply care about. So i TRULY appreciate and value your time&energy🥰

Doc ID: 15691, distribution: 0.7393937862372428 ; Question: Just a thought. As a Swedish-American living in the US but with plenty of family in Sweden, my thought is that Swedish people are just really healthy. I don't have any numbers to back that up, but their welfare system is well-developed, people generally live in good and spacious conditions, etc. I believe I read the people who have died in Sweden are elderly and/or refugees(who don't have access to all their resources...). You're right, it is interesting. Answer: I agree Sweden is a healthy place to live, I also have UK friends living there. However if you look at the deaths per million, Sweden have the th highest in the world so they're maybe not doing that great. But even the deaths number is so variable between countries, including or excluding as it does different settings. And being variably representative of the truth in different countries. I think looking back eventually at the excess deaths will give a more accurate picture but we'll probably never know the true numbers.

Bc here it's quite a big topic  Answer: Hmm there's surge testing going on right now which means when a case of the variant is found, testing goes door to door in that area to find anyone else that may be carrying it. That's currently for the UK variant and also for the South Africa variant. I hear more concern about the SA variant in the news than the UK one. I'm a bit confused about the UK variant because over Christmas it seemed to be all over the UK and it's main feature was it was so much more transmissible. I think its had another mutation now that potentially makes the vaccine less effective. What is being said about the UK variant in Europe?

Im the only one in the house not vaccinated and most likely to die from it. Ive always been overly careful this whole time so adding an extra layer of Careful™️ to that is easy for me.. luckily I keep a lot of food in my room so I can still eat when Im hungry and not have to stress about going to the kitchen and facing whatever/whoever is out there.  Still waiting for my turn to be vaccinated. Hope I dont die lmao that would suck balls

Doc ID: 15853, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: With self-isolation/social distancing etc, is there not a possibility that the virus could simply die out through being unable to be transmitted to another host? Therefore avoiding lots of people becoming sick/negating the need for herd immunity. That seems to be the approach of countries like Singapore Answer: Theres a tiny chance but I don't think anyone realistically thinks the virus is going to just die out. It's here to stay. It's so contagious and someone somewhere in the world will always have it, so it will then be retransmitted. Naturally acquired herd immunity is a problem because we don't know yet if people will be immune once they've had it or if they are, how long that immunity will last. A vaccine seems the most likely prospect for managing to live alongside this new virus.

We are allowed to meet with one other household in our garden or inside our house from this weekend, and social distancing is reducing from  metres to “ metre plus” (??).

Also most of the new covid cases come from a specific part of Poland (rn everybody is tested there to prevent more spreading)  and everywhere else the situation is pretty much under control. Also we were one of the first countries to introduce the full lockdown. I'm not sure what will come out of all this in the future but let's not freak out.

Answer: The original gap between Pfizer vaccine doses was  weeks, but the UK government has decided to extend it to  weeks so that more people can get their first dose and have some level of protection.The vaccine hasn't been tested with a  week gap so nobody quite knows what level of immunity anyone will have between  and  weeks, but the government is taking a gamble that it's better to have more people with say % immunity than fewer people with % immunity.

We do have measures for restaurants though; you have to reserve ahead of time to come in, then leave your number and name once you arrive so you can be contacted in case there's an outbreak at the the time you were there. It's also meant to ensure that you can trace back where an outbreak came from, and immediately contact people ahead of time to self quarantine. Answer: Germany continued- we never had a full lockdown either. We immediately enforced social distancing, non essential stores closed, and meeting people was limited to two people outside, and only households were allowed to be in the house together. Now we can have meetings of groups, more than two households can meet at someone's house, non essential stores have opened, and are numbers are due to sporadic outbreaks in specific areas (restaurants, easter vacations, etc…)——————-That sounds very well organised and under control. Very German! Sehr gut! Germany has appeared to manage the pandemic very well from what I've read and seen.

Baby's mum phoned in sick to the contact centre, but no one thought to ask her what her symptoms were. Contact centres could be hotbeds for viral spread, given the number of people going in and out of a small number of rooms all day every day. Plus there is VERY minimal (ie none) cleaning and sterilisation of toys etc going on between each contact session. I have fired off some emails enquiring about protocols. Schools are all still open but d's school has sent a letter saying that if they have to partially close due to teachers self-isolating or being off sick, certain year groups will be prioritised to continue going into school while other year groups will be told to stay at home.

It's very hard to debate with my dad as he can get quite aggressive, but it's slightly easier over email. However it does get me all wound up and anxious so H keeps telling me to step away from it. I think I will now. I've just done my th weekly Covid swab for the vaccine trial, they've all come back negative so far (no false positives here!) Who knows how long that will last though, my girls' schools have both got year groups out self-isolating due to positive Covid cases. It's total carnage. The students all go back to uni in the next couple of weeks and that is surely only going to make things worse too.

Answer: Oh yes, I've not been doing very well at keeping it secret. I've told my immediate family (d also got the vaccine because we were volunteering together) and also my extended family. And my friend. People I trust. I think it's more just don't broadcast it all over social media. I figure here doesn't count because it's anonymous. Actually I think maybe it's not quite such a big deal now because there's been quite a lot on the UK news today about how none of the vaccine must be thrown away and it should all go into the arms of people, so there'd be more understanding now of how we came to receive it. But probably not all the volunteers all over the country will get a chance to receive it, just because of different clinic circumstances, so I don't want anyone to think it's unfair.Do you mean different phases in the vaccine roll out? Yes there is, right now we are in phase one, which is over-s and frontline health care and social care workers. I think some of the clinically vulnerable as well? I'm not sure.

Answer: The point of isolation is to a) protect the vulnerable and b) *slow down* the rate of the general population catching it, so that our health services it is a process that doesn't really have a clear end date for exactly the reason you said. It's why the UK government have held out for a while, because if you quarantine everyone so efficiently that no one catches it, you just have a very vulnerable population when you let them out of quarantine.

Do you go out of your way to look at the USA news or is it common to hear about things going on in the US? it seems like here in the US most all of the news is only US focused. like I never hear things going on in Europe unless it's something major. of course i'm sure the election was something other countries watched, but otherwise? Answer: The USA news is all over the television in the UK at the moment, so much so that it would be hard to avoid it. We do usually get the “highlights” (in the last four years much of it has been more like lowlights) of the US news in with the world news. We probably hear more about US news than we hear about many other countries, but I'm sure there's loads of US news that never makes its way onto the world headlines.On the BBC and ITV, which are our two main TV channels, there's always a news programme at pm. This covers the headlines of world news and UK news. BBC also do a / news channel which H quite likes to watch, so we probably do see more news from around the world. I have to say, the US is quite fascinating/horrifying to watch on the news a lot of the time because (I feel that) we in the UK just don't understand the American people a lot of the time. I know the election coverage has probably shown the worst of some groups but even outside that, in general we/they seem to have a different approach to life. Having said that, I'm sure the UK is horrifying to watch at times to others too.

 now here's a TW for sexual abuse/trauma reactions
 it's scary how something that happened so long ago still affects me right now. most of the time i don't even think about it, but it also seems to be all over me, does that make sense? my severe jumpiness is known to everyone, i've legitimately fallen to the ground and half under a table at work once - because one of my coworkers suddenly entered the room quite fast and it startled me. me falling or jumping away or flinching is a super regular occurence at this point. only a few trusted people are allowed to touch me, otherwise i get uncomfortable as hell, leading up to feeling paralyzed and in shock with a following panic attack in the worst case. sudden noises or people (especially men) shouting/following me/running towards me scare the shit out of me. i can't stand anyone being behind me really and i can't sit with my back towards doors/open space without going mad, i always look out for escape routes instinctively. it's a part of me at this point, yes my poor girlfriend … despite being careful and understanding and all, sometimes a single move can send me straight into a flashback, meaning i curl up into a ball and completely lose touch with reality while sometimes shaking or crying, reliving it in my head or just disassociating. in this state i absolutely cannot be touched, else i just move away from whoever touches me in blind panic and it gets worse. last time a blanket was put around my shoulders, i apparently got off from the bed head first and curled up at the wall, looking like a bunny in panic. it's not technically my fault and i am aware of that, but i feel so very bad about it still. i keep reassuring her that it is not her fault when i snap, and i'm working on communicating more clearly what i need/when i am not okay with something. she keeps telling me it's okay and i don't have to apologize, but i still feel so sorry. she's not the one who hurt me, it's not fair how she has to put up with it anyway now, kind of? because i know i'm not the only one who is struggling, i know it's hard for people to understand and rationalize it has nothing to do with them personally when i snap and panic. somebody who once accidentally triggered this response in me said “i'll never forget this look in your eyes, you were so scared … of me!”. it's weird. yes i was scared, but not really scared of you. just. scared?

Then I volunteered to help out with the mass testing in d's school, which would have come to something if all the schools hadn't then been “shut” (I know they're far from being shut). Then a friend mentioned she was helping out marshalling at her church which has become a vaccine hub, and I said to let me know if they need more volunteers… and so finally tomorrow morning I can go and play a part in the vaccination effort. I'm excited to have a “job” to get up and go to (.am though? Haven't been up that early for a long time).

We can walk our neighborhood, however anywhere else on foot or bike is dangerous due to speeding and distance. People where I live still fly Trump flags, which I find disturbing. My parents are Trump supporters and my neighbor was at the Capitol riot. I deplore Trump and can't understand why people support him. Answer: My personal experience on the walking is largely driven by a stay in a suburban area outside New York, where the children's playground was  minutes walk away from the house but there were no pavements and when we walked anyway we got a lot of funny looks (and it didn't feel very safe). Then when we got there and said we'd walked, everyone else looked at us like we said we'd flown.I think takeout in the US is maybe different to takeout in the UK. Only based on the different ways we use it. In our family and the families around us, we might have takeout a couple of times a month as a treat. Our takeout is usually either curry, Chinese, pizza or fish & chips. They're pretty calorie dense and nutritionally poor in terms of vegetables etc and eating that  times a week would not be healthy plus it would be very expensive. I get the impression in the US that it's a) cheaper and b) a more regular way of feeding oneself?

technically it was just his test that came out positive while mine read negative but given the % accuracy of a positive test and a % chance of a false negative AND we spent every day for the last  months together, i'm gonna say “we” both tested positive

we both came out asymptomatic, took necessary precautions to isolate, and are feeling fine now, but my point is… even the most careful people are exposed. we're lucky because we're young, healthy, and i guess aren't predisposed to being hit hard by the virus but many are not as fortunate

we got tested because it was free in our area, and i thought it would be useful to know if we were carrying even if we didn't have symptoms

the pandemic isn't over. in fact, california's numbers have not really improved since lockdown started and aren't being helped by the businesses and social areas are opening up

I know some people in the US who are regularly getting tested even without symptoms and find it interesting how things are in the UK. I don't personally know people regularly getting tested but have heard of people doing it. Aren't you part of a trial? Answer: Oh yes I know some people have lied about it. However if you test positive, by law you have to self isolate for  days along with your household, and I think this puts some people off getting tested. I think more people lie the other way - not getting tested when they have symptoms, than lie to get a test. Yes I'm part of a trial so I actually do get tested every week. They've all been negative so far, but I have worried about what if one came back positive (while asyptomatic) and the effect that would have on people around me and places I've been (track and trace would be after them) and the things I wouldn't be able to do. Not so much now as we are about to go into another lockdown, but over the summer we had some holidays booked and a random positive test would have meant we had to cancel.I can see the benefit for the greater good of the population for regular testing, but why would an individual without symptoms get regular tests… I don't get that so much.

Doc ID: 16008, distribution: 1.0 ; I read a lot of posts about people worrying over catching coronavirus and how to prevent it. Guys, most of us are going to catch it no matter what we do. At least % at a conservative estimate. The social distancing, self isolating etc is not to stop us catching it but just to delay it, slow the rate of new cases and flatten 'the peak' so that our various health services can cope with the numbers of seriously ill cases needing hospital care at any one point in time. For most of us who are under  and healthy, we are going to catch it, recover and then likely be immune and be able to get out there and be useful as we will no longer transmit it.  Keep washing your hands and following the advice given, but understand that none of it will guarantee to prevent you catching coronavirus sooner or later. Plus if you don't catch it this year, you'll probably get it next winter when its likely to come back.

Our girls were watching it with us and commented that it was like The Hunger Games. There's lots about the US and the “American mindset” that we don't comprehend - Donald Trump, the handling of the pandemic, reluctance to wear masks, the way everything comes back to rights in the constitution, gun laws, cars etc etc. It's such a different frame of reference that it feels like we outside the US can't even debate it with you because the starting point isn't even on the same page. I fully appreciate not all Americans think the same, but to answer your questions of what we think of you as a country, we generally think the US is pretty crazy and we're glad we don't live there.

Answer: I think most people in the UK are ok with wearing them. There certainly has not been much controversy. I think (choosing my words carefully) there has been a much broader range of opinion on masks in the US, some of which seems incomprehensible to us in the UK. In our family, we have been wearing them when out and about in enclosed spaces. Even though their main aim is to protect others, they also give a sense of protection to ourselves and I think that increases people's decision to wear them.

Even people who've had two doses here, we aren't allowed to be hugging each other or going inside someone else's house or even into their garden. We can't leave our local area (vaguely thought to be  miles from ones own house).Maybe when the lockdown ends and the country opens up again it will feel different.

Big shoutout to @veganmutti for her crazy shopping trolley organisation, and @notjustclothing for sending me one of their face masks ✌🏻

Ok so in all honesty, something that was once a very normal activity felt incredibly strange. Mum and I was also very surprised that very few people were wearing masks!? In the UK it hasn't been mandatory to wear them in shops. Wearing a mask on public transport by is essential. However ... literally the next day it was announced that from the th of July, face coverings will be compulsory. Personally, I feel safer wearing a mask to protect those around me, and myself. Not sure if you feel the same? 🤔

Also as I said, this mask was from @notjustclothing and they a running a campaign where % of the profits go to @masksfornhsheros! It is very comfortable, not itchy at all, reusable and comes in  colours (if looking good in a face mask is a priority for you 😉). More importantly though, they are made from Diolen, which is very hygienic and allows you to breathe (and talk!) normally. They're also made here in the UK, so I highly highly recommend if you need/want a mask.

I think in the UK the public's relationship with the police is different to the US.

Answer: Ah it's all going a bit wrong again in the UK. Numbers of positive cases are on the rise again. The government has tried to spin it as being due to the increased numbers of tests that are being done in Covid hotspots, but that excuse is wearing a bit thin and unconvincing now. Schools have just gone back and several have had to send entire year groups home to self isolate or even close again after pupils and teachers tested positive. Universities are about to start over the next few weeks, which will cause another lot of mixing of people and quite likely cause a spike in cases. So, we sit and wait to see how bad it will be. Everything is pretty much reopened now, but things may have to start closing again in order for us to be able to keep schools open and case numbers down. For now we can meet  people or two households outside or just two households inside, but summer is coming to an end and autumn starts to get a bit chilly for meeting outside unless you are being active and walking etc Local lockdowns are in place in various areas where no meeting up indoors is allowed. I think we are headed for more of those. Just watching how even in New Zealand where they managed to have no cases at all for so long but then had a resurgence, I think it shows just how hard to control this virus is.

Answer: Hmm well for me it means I basically don't leave the house except for exercise, or once or twice a week to volunteer in the vaccine hub. It's work from home for H and school from home for the girls. Nobody else is allowed in the house or garden and we're not allowed to stay away overnight. I can meet up with one other person at a time outside in a public place to exercise, such as go for a walk together. We have to stay local for exercise, although there's no set rule on what is local, which means everyone interprets it differently (including the police who can and do impose fines if they consider you're not staying local). Non-essential shops are closed, but we can still shop online. We get our supermarket delivery once a week and so we generally don't have a need to go in any other shops anyway. Pubs, restaurants and cafes are closed although they are allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services so some have found ways to stay open.

Answer: I read a post that said mass vaccination is like a group project, and we're not done till we're all done, and I thought that was a really good way of putting it. I also read a news article today that said  in  UK over-s had broken the rules once they'd had their vaccine, and I was like 😳😳😳 Flipping over-s, behave yourselves!! I felt so much care for them all when they were coming for their vaccines and saying it was the first time they'd left their houses in months, and now they're out there socialising!

Doc ID: 14706, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I'm curious about how the vaccine study works. Are you allowed to get vaccinated (when the vaccine is approved for your population group)? Or is the study still going on and you shouldn't get vaccinated? Answer: If we get invited for a vaccine and are planning to accept it, the study will unblind us and tell us whether we have had the covid vaccine or the control. But then we're out of the study. So they'll only do it as and when - my neighbour who's a nurse and in the trial just got called for a vaccine and she unblinded and found that she'd already had the vaccine.

Doc ID: 14936, distribution: 0.25202600478830406 ; Question: What has changed in the UK since the beginning of the pandemic? Answer: Oh my, where to start….So first we had lockdown , where schools closed to most children and we all had to stay at home unless exercising, shopping or attending medical appointments. Keyworkers still went to work and schools stayed open to provide childcare for their children. The government motto was “Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives”Then that lockdown gradually got lifted, and over the summer we had some degree of normality back. The new motto was “Hands, Face, Space” ie wash hands, wear a face covering, social distance. Oh and we had “Eat Out to Help Out”, where meals out were half funded by the government Mon-Wed to help the economy.Cases started to rise and England went into a tier system - with varying rules on what we could and couldn't do in each tier. Cases continued to rise and now we are in Lockdown .. Schools have stayed open but we are supposed to be staying at home unless necessary to go out. However people are weary of everything and this lockdown has quite a different feel. It's not the same shut down as the first lockdown. If you go out, cars are still on the road, people are still walking down the street. In terms of what is different right now to before the pandemic, we all wear face masks when in any indoor public space, we can't meet indoors or in a private garden with anyone from another household. We are allowed to meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space, such as a park, so I suspect we are all doing a lot more walking than before because it's the only way to see a friend face to face. Currently non-essential shops are closed. Restaurants and cafes can only serve takeaway. Most doctors appointments take place over the phone or video call unless they decide we need to be seen in person. We are supposed to avoid using public transport unless absolutely necessary. There's a whole load of other rules about specific things and specific exemptions. All these things are put into law by the government so we can be fined if we don't follow the rules. Several people around the country have been fined £, for hosting house parties in direct contravention of the rules. We are all a bit focused on Christmas and whether we will be able to get together in family gatherings. Right now, who knows? It makes it hard to plan.

Doc ID: 15934, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Obviously in the U.K. we are isolating at home but when looking at Sweden and South Korea, it's potentially not the solution to self-isolate? I'm not saying it's right or wrong either way but the U.K. needs to be mass testing like Sweden and South Korea. If we do that, life can begin to go back to “normal” - what do you think?  Answer: Mass testing would certainly help the situation, especially for frontline workers. It still wouldn't change the fact that lots of us would still not be immune to the virus if it came our way, so I think there would still need to be a large degree of self isolating going alongside it. S Korea had a fairly specific situation in that the majority of its cases were clustered in a couple of centres. And I'm not sure Sweden is doing any better than the rest of the world, it still has a substantial number of cases - the most of any of the Scandinavian countries by numbers.But yes, I agree we need lots more testing - both testing for individuals to see if they have it now and testing for individuals to see if they have had it in the past. Even though we still don't know for sure whether having had it in the past will make us immune from having it again, we just don't know enough about the virus yet. The trouble seems to be that the tests aren't yet widely available and/or adequately developed in the UK. And as Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer, said “The only thing worse than no test is a bad test”. Jumping in too soon with tests that aren't reliable could have devastating consequences. The government is really coming under fire though for inadequate test numbers, so let's see what today's press conference brings. I think testing will be the hot topic.

Doc ID: 16017, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I dont live in the UK so I dont know all the details, but from what I've seen it sounds like boris Johnson is not handling the coronavirus appropriately. Why aren't they shutting down and taking appropriate steps? It seems like he has made very insensitive comments about how some people will die and that he just doesnt care about the vulnerable population. I'm curious your thoughts Answer: Boris Johnson and his scientific advisors have made their recommendations on the basis of scientific predictions. I do understand the logic - we need around % of people to catch corona (and survive) so that we have herd immunity because this virus is likely to be a seasonal thing now. Also we need to flatten the peak of cases occurring now so that the healthcare system can cope. Plus people can only cope physically and emotionally with self isolating for finite lengths of time and may start disobeying it right at the critical time if we start too early. If we close the schools, grandparents may end up looking after the children thereby putting a vulnerable age group at more risk of catching it. Their model says schools would need to be closed for - weeks for it to be effective at preventing virus spread, which would clearly have a massive effect on the country.It's true though that people will die. I think Boris said that so we all appreciate the severity of the situation and the importance of doing our bit - handwashing, self isolating etc. Unfortunately it did come across as a bit uncaring and when we look at what the rest of the world is doing, it's hard to keep faith in the UK government that their policies are enough when many other governments clearly think differently.Partly also the UK is somewhat behind mainland Europe in the course of the pandemic. We still have relatively low numbers of covid . So their advice may change over the next few days and weeks as the situation changes.I'm following the BBC live news feed quite obsessively to keep up with the world situation.

Doc ID: 14636, distribution: 1.0 ; Because I got my vaccine kind of secretly (they gave volunteers at the vaccine hub the leftover doses at the end of the day to save throwing them away), we're not allowed to tell anyone we've had it.  Which is no big deal except all my healthcare worker friends are getting theirs and plastering the fact all over Facebook and every time I read another post like that, I feel irritated that I can't say Yay Me too!  Ultimately it doesn't make any difference and I'm so grateful to have unexpectedly been given the vaccine, I'd just like to be able to process the emotion of it with other people. Instead my fellow volunteer friend and I just message each other back and forth going I can't believe I got it! How sore is your arm? How are you feeling? Doesn't it suck we can't tell anyone!

Doc ID: 14768, distribution: 0.3277711277785023 ; In the UK we have a five day window over Christmas where we are legally allowed to travel and visit with other households to make a three household bubble. The government is emphasising (as cases rise) that just because we are allowed doesn't mean we should.  We have decided in discussion with my parents and my sister, that we will travel up and visit them for the five days. I don't think they have worried over it half as much as I have. I wish they would express a bit more concern although they have had lower cases than we have so I think maybe it doesn't seem such an immediate worry. Anyway, we are going to isolate from Friday (tomorrow in fact) so we should have four clear days before we travel. Then we'll travel without stopping on the way. That's the best we can do. Once there we will just be in our bubble and won't go anywhere or see anyone else. H and I are practically self isolating anyway, we are very diligent at following the rules. The girls have been in school but today was their last day so all that contact stops from now. Of course that is all dependant on Boris not changing the rules over the next week which I would not be surprised if he did if cases keep on rising. Holding everything lightly. But we will all be gutted if we can't go.

Doc ID: 14431, distribution: 1.0 ; I feel somewhat bemused by everyone's “now I've had the vaccine I can hug my mum” statuses. I had the vaccine  weeks ago and my behaviour hasn't changed one bit as a result. I still wear a mask, still social distance and definitely have not been hugging anyone outside my household. It never occurred to me that after having the vaccine I could do any other things… I don't know if that's just me being dumb.  Probably it's partly me because I know I'm quite black and white about things, and I just follow the rules, vaccine or no vaccine. So as and when UK lockdown relaxes, I'll go with that. Maybe it's partly that I'm lucky that I'm quite happy with my lockdown life and so I'm not looking for any ways out. d wants to come home from uni next weekend for d's birthday, and I really don't agree but it seems she's coming anyway. However her and I having had the vaccine doesn't have any bearing on the decision.

My infectious disease friend says Long Covid is the disease of middle aged women. Certainly seems that way from people I know.

Doc ID: 16351, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: When do you need to get your first cervical screening? Does it hurt? Answer: In the UK, it's at age . You should get a letter from your doctor inviting you to go. If you have never been sexually active, you are unlikely to need screening so check that out with your doctor before you go. This is because cervical cancer and the pre-cancerous changes that screening aims to pick up are connected with the Human Papilloma Virus, which is a sexually transmitted virus. In the UK, teenage girls are routinely vaccinated against this now but you should still attend screening when you're invited. Teenage boys can pay to get the HPV vaccine privately currently, but I think they too may soon get it routinely on the NHS.No it doesn't hurt. It can just be a bit uncomfortable, but it's over really quickly. The more you can relax, the more comfortable it is - but of course that's easier said than done. I was able to chat to the nurse all the while she was doing it. I even commented that maybe I should have shaved my legs, and she made a pshaw kind of noise, like leg-shaving was so irrelevant in the world of cervical screening that she couldn't care less what state they were in. My appointment was at .am and I was walking out of the doctors surgery by .am so that's how quick it was.

Doc ID: 14492, distribution: 1.0 ; H got his covid vaccine today! Foster carers class as frontline socialcare workers, so we are in a priority group. I'm not entirely sure I agree we should be, but since we are, we are getting the jab. Because now services will expect us to be willing to facilitate contact etc etc and there will be conflict if we declined the vaccine and then don't want to take risks. Personally I think teachers, police, supermarket workers, anyone who comes into contact with many many members of the public each day should be more of a priority.  But anyway, H had his vaccine, so now he can go back to sitting in his work-from-home office seeing no one all day every day. We have just decided to go back on the list for a new foster placement so maybe he will have a bit more human contact soon.

Doc ID: 14831, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Are you still involved in a vaccine trial for COVID-? Can you tell us more about the trial such as how you found out about it, how many people are in it, what you have to do, and more? Answer: Yes I'm involved in the Oxford vaccine trial. There were adverts out earlier in the year looking to recruit volunteers, that's how I found out about it, and I thought I could do my bit to try and help save the world - we don't get many chances to make a big difference like that. There's some thousands of people involved in it, in multiple countries. I've had a vaccine (and a second vaccine dose) which could be the COVID one or it could be a meningitis one (which they used as a control). I have to go back every few months for blood tests, and I have to do a COVID swab every week for the duration of the trial, which I think is a year. That's about it.

Doc ID: 14533, distribution: 1.0 ; I've been volunteering at the vaccine hub again this afternoon. It was crazy busy because we were doing two days worth of vaccines in one day. We got told last week a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was arriving on Tuesday and then later that a batch of Pfizer was arriving on Wednesday. The Pfizer has to be used in three days, so we had to do ALL the AstraZeneca today.  doses. We had to open a waiting room for the waiting room, because even with the best will in the world,  vaccinators cannot get ahead with those numbers. Every time one vaccinator table paused to draw up more vaccines, or to give a little extra time to someone who needed it, the queue built up.  I did a  hour shift and walked  steps. “Next please! Hi there…. come through…. follow me…. just take a seat right here” *big smile behind mask so that it spreads to my eyes and they can see it* Return to the door. Repeat. I think I might be doing it in my sleep. I'm back there again on Friday. I think today it was the + age group as well as healthcare workers. We are moving on to people not in the top four priority groups for the next few days, I think. Tomorrow I was meant be meeting a friend in the morning for a walk and another friend in the afternoon, but because our car is stuck on our road in the snow and likewise for my friend and her car, I've had to cancel the morning friend. I can't say I'm too sad. A rest will be nice.

Which I know is not the same thing but it's worrying me, especially because I can see the logic in it, but surely for everyone's mental health they can't keep  year olds away from their families. But then I think what they did for care homes and hospital visitors etc and I fear they can.In Scotland students are not allowed to visit home, say for the weekend, because that classes as two households mixing indoors, which is not allowed. That rule hasn't come in in England yet but I'm worried it will do soon.I'm in the six month slump, weary of it all, and missing d and worrying about her - although she is settling in.

Doc ID: 15951, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Do you still believe quarantining the population is not effective because eventually everyone will catch it anyways? And earlier you said if no one catches it we are not building herd immunity? Is this true?  Answer: Hmm I think that's a bit of a twist on what I said. This is the situation as I understand it.Quarantining the population is effective because it *delays* the transmission, flattening the peak of the cases and decreasing the chance of the health services becoming overwhelmed. In the UK, we are all socially distancing and keeping  metres away from anyone not in our household. All non-essential businesses are closed. This will remain in place until the “surge” is over and the numbers of cases stabilise and fall to a manageable level for the health service. Then it's probable that some elements of the social distancing will be relaxed, and what is likely to happen then is that as we start to mingle again, the case numbers will gradually rise again. Then there'll be another clamp down and social distancing measures put back in place. This relax and tighten process will potentially be repeated several times over a period of months. Many of us will catch it during this time, but for lots of us we will have only very mild or no symptoms and may not even realise we've had it. If they bring in antigen testing, we will be able to test to know for sure who has had it.It's all theoretical at the moment because no one knows for sure how the virus behaves. We don't know yet if we will be immune to it once we've had it once, so it's hard to know whether we will as a population develop herd immunity but I think that's kind of the idea once most of us have had it.

Doc ID: 15695, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Just a very open-ended question out of curiosity: how do you feel about some other (European) countries and their corona measures? Compared to the UK maybe? If you don't feel like thinking/writing about it, just ignore this question haha, it's purely out of curiosity! Answer: I find it very interesting but I just have more questions and no answers. I'm really curious for example as to why Germany has such a low mortality rate compared to the UK when I believe our healthcare systems are pretty similar. Is it an actual physical reality or is it to do with different representations of the numbers/ proportions of testing etc. I'm interested to watch Sweden and see their numbers given that they held firm against a lockdown at the point where the UK changed strategy. (Although I think we'd have had an even bigger disaster in the UK if we hadn't imposed a lockdown - and why hasn't that happened in Sweden?)Are there different mutations of the virus that have reached different countries, causing some to have higher mortality rates than others?How do genetics and population demographics impact on the death rate? Given that it's quite clear that having a higher BMI is a big independent risk factor for a poor outcome, how does that impact on the HAES movement? Why does smoking seem to be a protective factor and is this why some countries with higher proportions of smokers have lower mortality rates? What is really going on in many countries around the world whose data is suspect? And so on and so on.

On the outside the primary series might seem boring and repetitive with nothing else to offer. BUT I keep learning more and more every time I step on the mat and practice.

I don't think I will ever stop being a student and learning from it. there's so much more that I can learn from this particular primary series and that's why even though I've learned the secondary series I don't feel like I am ready for those lessons yet… If that makes any sense I've been getting a lot of questions about whether or not I still practice secondary series and I don't because I still want to squeeze out more from a regular primary series practice before I move onto the next thing

.
.
when i finally reintroduced movement, i had no idea how to do so with grace. i would wake up at  AM to put in a two hour circuit, forcing myself through reps on an empty stomach, wishing i was anywhere but here.
.
.
then i would shower, climb back into bed, and wake around noon for a second workout in this same gym. a long distance run. i hated every second.
.
.
i haven't worked out down here since. today, in the midst of the quarantine chaos, i laced up my sneakers and headed down the stairs. i tied my hair in a ponytail and stared at myself in the mirror. i swore for myself i'd bring happiness and light to this once-toxic space. to this forgotten war zone, where i waged battle against myself every day, twice a day, for years.
.
.
i didn't follow a guide or a streamed workout. i simply turned up my music and had FUN. i lifted things and put them down. i jumped around. i stopped to dance. i took  minutes to be in my own company and to move with love, for myself, an expression of gratitude for all the growth i've undergone.
.
.
today i healed. today i loved. this epidemic, this chaos, this quarantine. it's devastating and flipping all of our lives upside down. but for me, today, it was a small blessing in disguise. it forced me to confront the lingering corners of a dark past, and flash a light into them.

all that being said, i DO always want to share companies and brands that i enjoy. @classpass has been a really fun option when it comes to working out at home! all studios and gyms near me will be closed for a very long time, so i've been utilizing @classpass's on demand workouts for some inspiration. they have tons of livestream and pre-recorded options that are free with your membership 🔥 you can swipe up on my current stories for more info on that and how to sign up :)

Doc ID: 9116, distribution: 1.0 ; reflecting back on how I felt around last year. after one of my toughest relationships, ruining friendships, stressing through the last leg of my nutrition and dietetics program before I graduated, I felt so lost in myself. I like to escape and avoid but I didn't feel right anywhere I looked for refuge.

then I went to india. I learned yoga- TRUE yoga. the stuff that you don't see. the connection between mind-body-spirit. the stuff you think is voodoo and unrealistic until you a c t u a l l y experience it.

there are a bunch of other things that have gotten me here obviously but I think yoga kick started and reinforces the not-so-new revelation that home is not external. home is you. it's wherever you are. it's wherever I am

disclaimer- you do NOT need to go to india to learn yoga. check out your local yoga studio, and online yoga communities with full length classes like @bananablondie and @omstarsofficial

So here is my first little insta workout for you all. Using the machines and weights in the gym can be extremely intimidating at first, and I think one of the reasons is because we often don't know how to use the machines! Therefore, as I've mentioned in previous posts, I want to hopefully show you guys how to use the different machines and what muscles you should be working.
-
These  exercise I did for  minute each, and repeated the whole circuit  times. This is a bit more of an unusual style, instead of say do a set number of reps. However personally, I prefer lifting a slightly lighter weight and doing more reps over a longer time period. It helps you get used to how the machine works, and I sometimes find that just doing one exercise at a time gets a bit boring!
-
Exercise  // Lat pull down //  minute
Focus on pulling your elbows in and down. This mostly works your lats, one of the largest muscles of the back, but you will also engage your biceps a bit as well.
Exercise  // Seated chest fly //  minute
Keep your arms slightly bent and shoulder blades pinned back.
Exercise  // Flat chest press //  minute
Don't lock your elbows at the top, have a slight arch in your back and press your feet firmly against the ground. 
Exercise //  Low row //  minute
Pull your elbows in and back, and hold then the squeeze for a second or so to feel the burn.

I used to hate the fact that I had an athletic build and always wanted to be taller. The latter is still definitely true (I'm '” and I've definitely stopped growing😅) but I'm now learning to love the fact that I can be strong. I can run (faster), jump (higher), lift some (heavier) weights and walk two strong puppies both at once 😉
Basically, today's message of the day is to love what you've been given. Everyone is different and we can't have everything. For sure we all have our insecurities and things that we'd like to change, but at the end of the day it's so important to be proud of the fact that we are all unique. Nobody else has what you have, you know! Say that out loud and it's pretty empowering when you think about it in that way (comment down below if you did it) 🙌🏻 Right, that's my mini motivational speech for you all. Bye for now 😏

Ashtanga has  different series that are followed the same each time that focuses on moving into each posture with the breath. I love the structure of it and the fact that even if you memorize the whole series, theres always something to improve on, somewhere we can go deeper. I love how when it all comes together, it looks like a dance. More importantly, it feels like a dance I am having with myself. Breathing with me, feeling every part of me, trusting myself to go deeper, trusting myself to take a break and breath, embracing each drop of sweat and each pull of my muscles. I find myself falling in love more and more with each step of the dance. #rishikesh #rishikeshdiaries #applesandamandas #travel #india #yoga #rishikeshyoga #yogaeverydamnday #ashtanga

But most of all you need to work on your practice daily without judgment. There is no secret but showing up (mostly) every day and breathing through all the bumps mountains and twists life brings. There is no pre requisite to stretching or doing yoga. The only thing you need to is the will to be with yourself and to tell your  am thoughts to "shhhhhh.... I'm breathing. I'll get to you later."

Idk about you, but I had the Monday blues today: lack of motivation, bloated after all the Christmas/NYE feasting & was honestly just feeling pretty sluggish & bleh.

But when I got to the gym today — first session of the year — I greeted a lovely man with a disability at the door & he completely refreshed my perspective & mindset. 

First of all, his aura was so positive, he was genuinely happy to be there & because of his disability, he crawled from machine to machine throughout his workout, even though his tremors made it increasingly more difficult, even though it seemed like his limbs worked against him, even though some people sadly stared as he grunted with every movement, he still pushed himself & got his body moving. 

It reminded me what a true blessing it is to be able to move my body. It never deserves punishment, only embracing.

I wanted to thank him for showing me his strength & perseverance, for inspiring me, encouraging me & reminding me of what's truly important. 

I appreciate these legs, for they take me wherever I need to go 🦵 

I appreciate my arms, because they hold my fav food, my fav people and all of my fav things 💪 

I appreciate my tummy, because it homes some of my vital organs, provides warmth to my body & is soft to hug!! 🤗

I appreciate my stretch marks for proving to me how strong my body is, that it grows, stretches & heals for me.

I appreciate this weird little flesh sack that society tells me should look a certain way even though it literally does so much for me & that in itself is beautiful as heck.

Anyway, just some food for thought going into this week! Maybe it'll inspire you to be thankful for your bod too 😇

You ask, I provide 😋 I figured I'd start creating posts for my most frequently asked questions - if you have any, leave them below!

After  years of health and fitness, I've finally been able to create a structure that is flexible, enjoyable, something I don't dread doing and one I believe I can maintain long-term. To me, my goals aren't crazy, they're realistic and achievable. My focus is no longer physique-based, but more on moving my body to feel strong and maintain my level of fitness. So this is just what works for me 💪🏼

What are your goals? And what's your favourite way to get your body moving? Let me know below! 🤩

My gym routine isn't just about the muscle groups I train, it also includes a few of my favourite supplements (along with a balanced diet) as well. If I ever want a lil energy boost, I use @macrmike tropical mixed berry or lychee berry pre-workout before I head to the gym, then I sip on the tropical mango plant-based aminos throughout each workout, these contain electrolytes, vitamins and aminos which are all important for muscle development, recovery and strength. I usually re-fuel with some vanilla buttercream protein oats afterwards. I like to stay nourished throughout the day with plenty of nutritious but delicious meals/snacks too! I've included an example in the post 🥰

You can shop the @macrmike performance, baking mixes, nut butters & protein range through the link in my bio & enjoy % off with my code: AMB-BREE xo

P.s. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm not a PT so my form may not be perfect and I'm not advising you guys that this is the best routine or way to workout, this is purely just to share what I do to maintain my goals and perhaps give you some inspiration for your own workout routine.

Doc ID: 6775, distribution: 0.16633111547111704 ; what i thought vs what i know about exercise ⬇️

i thought that to be “healthy”, i had to work out vigorously every single day with absolutely no rest. 

i thought that if i didn't break a sweat then a work out didn't “count”. 

i thought that being the girl who “loves fitness” and is “always in the gym” was the highest possible praise i could receive, and i strived for it with a relentless hunger.

i thought and i thought and i thought but i never took time to stop thinking and just listen to my body. i let my obsession with exercise snowball. i was infatuated with the idea that exercise could be used to burn off food i had eaten or to earn food i wanted to eat. i saw movement as a means to make myself smaller, which i wrongly believed meant healthier.

 years later, here's what i know.

i know that to be “healthy”, by my personal definition, i need to approach exercise from a place of love and grace. this means skipping workouts when i don't feel up to them, and resting deeply and often.

i know that low impact workouts and simple movement like walking all contribute to my health in a meaningful way.

i know that being the girl who loves her body for what it can do and not for what it looks like is the person i want to be every single day, because this girl is the happiest in all areas of life.

movement should be fun. it should be a celebration of life and strength. your healthiest self will not see exercise as a means to an end (punishment or a smaller body), but instead as a part of a happy life, not the entire life itself.

i promise if you're stuck in a hard place with exercise right now, that it gets better. please take care of yourself. rest when you need it. move how you want to, not how you feel pressured to. 

i hope this reaches anyone who needs the reminder xx

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I get this a lot since I used to do a lot of weight lifting, endurance sports, and intense exercise before making yoga my preferred exercise activity. I also had this worry when I realized I wouldn't be lifting weights at the gym while i went off for my yoga teacher training in India for a month. I was more excited to do yoga and leaving in a few weeks so i tucked that thought away to deal with later.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I came home after a whole month of no "intense" exercise. Instead i had a whole month of daily yoga and walking. I got comments that I've gotten leaner, i look stronger. I felt more limber and strong-- in the way I could hold up my own body weight for long periods of time with an even, smooth breath.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I felt more at peace with my body, too. One thing about a regular yoga practice is that it breaks my ego down and reminds me of what is most important. What self love really feels like. I wanted to prioritize my functionality and my ability to bend and move freely. I LOVE me some intensity, so I'll still play around with HIIIT and calisthenic workouts, kettlebell circuits, even get a day pass at the gym to throw around some weights. But you can bet that most days, I'm just doing yoga. Not just because it can build/maintain muscle and strength if I want it to, but because it makes me FEEL good. and when you feel good... you have this glow that automatically makes you LOOK good. No matter what size, what muscle mass %, no matter what weight.
.
A year later and i look at myself in the mirror and surprisingly, my body's kinda the same size. I have little less muscle definition, but i'm okay with that. What has changed is that I can look at myself without wanting to change anything. And I'm okay with whatever shape my body takes.
.
that's REALLY how yoga (among other things) has changed me.

 and I did  minutes before i stopped myself and said: I don't want to.  Learning to stop myself from doing exercise just because i want to burn calories was very hard and still is. A few days ago i read a post on ig that said that one should not exercise at all during recovery until you have form a healthy relationship with it and THAT is a hard pill to swallow and it is taking me time to come to terms with it so i tried to find a middle-ground, and while it is not the best option at all and i do not condone anyone to follow my footsteps, i only do yoga when i want to for the time my body wants to…most of the time.  I think this topic of exercise is one that constantly slaps me in the face whenever i feel like my journey of recovery is done, that i am fine mentally and health wise. I am not but i will, and i know so because i want to be, so, i will continue to work with my relationship with yoga because is pretty neat and i really want it to be a plus on my life, not a form of punishment for my healthy habits that my ed voice deems bad.  Exercise is not about burning calories, i know that much :)

Doc ID: 8958, distribution: 1.0 ; September is national yoga awareness month! 

I thought I would share a few things that are integral to yoga, starting with the  limbs. The  limbs of yoga  are the bread and (vegan) butter to the teachings of yoga. They are steps that act as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. They serve as a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline. They direct attention to one's health and help us to acknowledge the more spiritual aspects of ourselves.

Notice how asana, or postures, is only one of the . Yoga is truly a lifestyle that encompasses mindfulness and love for others and the self. Read more about it in Patanjali's “Yoga Sutra”! That's one of the books that are required in most yoga teacher training courses. 

Of course, I am just a baby in my yoga life so if you want to learn the true teachings of yoga (aka not just doing cool postures), my personal favorites for yoga wisdom are @larugayoga and @kinoyoga.

I'll be sharing more yoga infographics this month but we shall just start with this one :)

where i learned that the physical yoga practice is a vessel for mental strength practice
that going % is not always better than going %
that happiness is not in an achievement but it just is
that the breath can always take you wherever you need to be

i went to Rishikesh after i graduated in  as a little gift to myself and loved it so much i went for advanced training at the same school  months after.  i didn't (and still don't) mean to become a teacher right away- i just wanted to learn about yoga a little bit deeper than i've been exposed to. i still have a lot of learning to do, but what i've learned has been slowly transforming me. 

i was just thinking about this time after a friend and i (that i met all the way across the world at my YTT) caught up and shared laughs and good bites. she and her boyfriend were in the room next to me, were both from california, vegan, and were both going into medical school afterwards. now we hang out in each other's living rooms and she talks about her real baby and i talk about my fur baby.

connections and events like that prove to me that life is more than random coincidences…

and if it ends up being coincidences at the end of it- at least i enjoyed it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 💕

but there are a lot of other things not in our control

i try to remind myself of this when things get turbulent: control what i can control.... let go & make peace with what is

i thought about this a bit during my practice. i used to have a stronger more consistent ashtanga yoga practice but i took along break last year. starting back up slowly means watching myself struggle with postures that were much easier before. 

while it's an opportunity to berate, be upset with, and be frustrated with myself.... it's an even bigger opportunity to lean into my patience and self compassion. also an opportunity to be extra grateful for muscle memory and growth and strength. it's also a huge exercise in humility and grace to accept what is here and work with it. 

so if you're stuck somewhere you don't want to be or perhaps further than where you expected, feel what you feel remembering it, too, will pass

——
i've been an athlete my entire life, and growing up, i was always told to push myself harder and to my limit. while there's some merit in pushing yourself in order to go further, there's also A LOT of value in realizing and respecting when your body is asking you not to, prioritizing other things, taking rest days even when you don't feel like you “need” to in order to help your muscles grow, going to the gym for  minutes instead of an hour, giving % in a fitness class instead of %, and doing low intensity movement like yoga or walking - ALL movement still “counts”

 cont. under read more:  Anyways with this self isolation thing going on part of me wants to help myself get in better shape, I mean my lb dog makes my arms give out. when I say im out of shape, i mean my muscles are threads and going up  steps leaves me winded. Im not talking about “summer body toned” i mean literally i have like no strength at all my muscles are just paper. I cant even stand in the kitchen to cook without needing to sit down before I pass out. 

But how do I get healthy when I cant even control myself in exercise mode? Theres such a thin line between “im doing the correct amount and thats perfectly fine” and “work out until all i see is white and I wake up on the floor”

I just want to be normal. I want to have normal strength. Normal stamina. I want my body to be human. Instead Im a soggy tissue and trying to better myself only ends in the eating disorder taking over. I feel that way about ever attempt to better myself.. work out? Ed ruins it. Eat healthy? Ed ruins it. Eat more? Ed ruins it. Eat less? Ed ruins it. Drink more water? Ed ruins it. Every time I try to just be normal, Ed pushes it to the extreme in any direction and ruins it. I look normal. talking about it with people isnt really helpful. No one believes me and they always try to convince me that im lying. They overestimate my abilities just because of how i look. bro theres no muscle under my skin its just fat. take a squeeze lmao not even lying…. I wish I could change it. I used to play sports wtf.. Ive been trying to do At Home work outs… I hate it. Ive always hated exercising. I only did it for hours to punish myself. It has never been enjoyable.

Doc ID: 9092, distribution: 1.0 ; ^^ something I've previously said (not sure where but I remember ). and now I see how it can be problematic. i'm thinking about the way I said it and it just sounds like the only way that I can be smoothed into a nicer person is if I physically bend and fold and stretch and move gracefully. yes this is part of yoga but it is not the ONLY way to practice yoga. yoga is a “union” of body mind and soul that only requires your mental focus and breath. you can be doing yoga and sitting in the car, cleaning the house, or balancing on your big toe on the top of a mountain.

I don't want to only be a nicer person AFTER my asana practice. I want to be a nicer person before, throughout as well as after my practice. my aim is not to have a bad mood, stretch, and all of a sudden the problem is solved— my aim is to recognize an emotion/reaction, validate it, and move on with a relaxed heart. this is what my daily practice has taught me, although I am human and still get fired up for longer than you'd expect haha

it is kind of true that I am a “nicer” person after the introduction of yoga in my life, but I want the physical practice to be a TOOL to help me move through obstacles in my life off the mat the same way I move through postures in the series.

Doc ID: 9043, distribution: 0.5970758163715943 ; This is what my "exercise" is as of late. It's crazy that the more I do yoga, the less I really care about looking "fit" and building muscle. I just want to flow through my practice smoothly and enjoy it. Inherently I end up building body strength in ways I didn't even know possible. Exploring the self is a beautiful thing. Resting is a beautiful thing. Enjoying my body no matter how easy or intense the movement is... Is a beautiful thing

If you're ready to break away from the "I must exercise to eat" pattern or "if I don't work out the food I eat is pointless" idea, come work with me! my sessions end up being some sort of self exploration that will bring you peace with your food and body :) link in bio!

Doc ID: 2641, distribution: 0.4403572934808056 ; CARDIO 🏃🏻‍♀️ VS 🏋🏻‍♀️ WEIGHTS???

I weigh the exact same amount in both photos but my body looks different. That's because the ratio between fat & muscle has changed 💪🏼

On the left: I did only HIIT & cardio-based training! On the right: I do weightlifting & resistance training!

I still do a mix of both to this day, I'm not saying one is good and the other is bad! The great thing about exercise is that there's not just one type of movement you should do. Move your body in ANY way you enjoy! 😻 But as a female, I used to be scared to lift weights because I thought I'd get bulky & 'manly'... It really doesn't work that way!

🏋🏻‍♀️ Don't be afraid of lifting weights & strength training! Toning up is the act of gaining muscle. This is what gives your body definition. You will not get bulky overnight, gaining muscle takes time!! But this also depends on your genetic makeup. For some, gaining muscle comes more naturally. 

🏃🏻‍♀️ Walking is my FAV form of cardio. It's a passive & low-impact way to get your body moving, plus it's amazing for maintaining your overall health. That's why I always start my day with a light walk!

🍽 To gain muscle, you have to be eating ENOUGH & this usually means you have to eat in a SLIGHT calorie surplus. This gives your body that little bit of extra energy it needs to build muscle.

⏰ Give it time. I didn't notice my body changing very much as each day passed, but now that I look back I can definitely see the difference! Remember the paper towel analogy I posted last week!! 😉

🥪 Eat enough protein & carbs, they aren't bad! I prioritised my protein intake to ensure I was getting enough. I also didn't avoid carbs at all throughout my entire health & fitness journey. They're the body's preferred energy source! Enjoy them! 

😴 Rest & recover! This is where the magic happens. Your body is constantly working hard for you, so giving it that time to actually recover is vital! 🛌 

What kind of exercise do you prefer? 🙈

.
.
but recently, i've stopped leaning toward what my body looks like as a gauge of love. i still love my body, but not for what i can see as much as for what i feel. i ask myself this:
.
.
what can my body do?
.
.
it can finally hold *decent* handstands (i've been practicing for months)! my core is strong enough to hold me up, even when things get flipped upside down. .
.
it can endure a brutal but amazing training session @tonehouse each week (and gets better each time, i thinkkkk)! these classes aren't daunting anymore. they're therapeutic and empowering! .
.
it can fill out clothes for a woman and not a child. it can stand for longer than five minutes without seeing stars and triggering faint spells. it can send a hunger signal to my brain without fear of rejection. .
.
it can give to and receive others. hugs, laughs, smiles. it can see it's own reflection in a mirror and feel...acceptance. .
.
my eating disorder started as a pursuit for a tiny waist and a flat stomach. you know what?
.
.
it nearly took my life.
.
.
i was so obsessed with what my body looked like and not what it could do. when i was extremely underweight my body couldn't do anything. it could barely breathe and walk without discomfort. .
.
well, i've finally given up on such a shallow goal. when i shifted my mindset to focusing on what my body could do in good health, i fell in love with the abilities it granted me...
.
.
and they're sure as hell not worth cashing in for a body that lacks the strength, heart, passion, and LIFE that come with the body i have today.
.
.
if this is the body that brings me the greatest peace internally, then i accept it as it is. healing is a process, always in flux, but when you hit the milestones like this one...you realize it's worth every second ♥️

It's going to be a set of four upper body exercises, so not very many, but I do them as supersets as I will explain in the caption, and my arms are shaking by the end of it (which you can see quite clearly in the videos) 😂

The reason why I want to start posting videos like this is to not only give you some workout inspiration, but also help you guys out if you've not used gym machines in the past. Before my brother started helping me out, I had no clue how to use any of the machines. I took a lot of time trialling different ones and getting the form right before I started putting together some mini-workouts. That way I could make sure I was isolating and working the right muscle, and just building my confidence using machines and weights in the gym (which can be a very male-dominated area 😅)! I'm hoping that I'll be able to explain how to use each machine correctly and what it should be doing. A lot of this knowledge is being channelled from @matt.j.white so big shout out to my not so little brother anymore (who actually turns  today 🎉). He also filmed all my videos and did a pretty good job 😏 Watch this space people✌🏻

Doc ID: 9191, distribution: 1.0 ; oh it's not a yoga photo....odd
.
except it still is. yoga off the mat ✌🏼 yoga is still commonly seen as exercise or a way to relax but for me, it's so much more. it's a lifestyle and i've started to see how everything I do goes right back to yoga. including the idea that animals (and their secretions and their babies) are made to be eaten.
.
the sanskrit word “ahimsa” is a common principle in yoga that means “non-violence.” to the self, to others, in thoughts, actions, and words. ive learned that a truly yogic lifestyle is one that has the least amount of negative impact possible on the environment around you. to me, one of the easiest is being able to choose foods that cause less harm than others.
.
eating/living plant based is an act of non violence to the earth (see cowspiracy), non violence to other sentient beings (see earthlings), non violence to my wallet (when done logically, it's so much cheaper), and non violence to my own body (see forks over knives, what the health, &tagged health professionals)
.
so that's one of the many many reasons why plant based eating is the only way for me
.
yoga also means, at the very root, union. everything is a union. and today eating vegan foods with friends as a way to unite and spend time together is soooo easy bc places like @nextlevelburger make bomb ass vegan food. like hello fully loaded fries i'm amanda nice to meet u🤤😍
.
I shared this meal with non vegans who were super happy and FULL after we ate. it's possible to spread love and veganism without being pushy and annoying through the amazing food options popping up

what vegan food have you shared with your friends/family that they were pleasantly surprised with? 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻

_______
i noticed a similarity with social media. the more time i spent scrolling through my feed filled with certain images and videos, i found a subconscious pull to shape my own actions and goals to that. whether it was fitness, beauty, fashion, meals, hobbies, etc. the more i surrounded my mind with outside influences, the more i wanted to do the same
_______
don't get me wrong, i defffffffff am not immune to trends. i fucking love these infographics all over IG right now for example. i've actually always loved doing this kinda graphic stuff but never knew i could apply it to my page in a useful way until i saw other people do it. i think they're interesting and very useful for future reference
_______
i just am more conscious about who i follow and why. i try to not spend too much time “watching” and “absorbing” the works of others as it hampers my own creative process/development
_______

for example, this is my body now- without trying to change or shape anything. once i stopped surrounding myself with all the “body” goals i used to scroll through, i found this new appreciation and acceptance where i am right now
_______
i love appreciating the works of others and sharing their creations with the world. i love raising other people up. i just don't feel the need to label anyone or anything as “goals” because trends and influences come and go. what stays is that quiet voice that reminds us over and over who we truly are.

Doc ID: 8805, distribution: 1.0 ; my first and biggest teacher on what true fitness is for ~me~

was yoga asana

previously i thought exercise was just to be “fit” so i can “have” abs. 

then i got on a yoga mat and realized how hard it is to actually hold up my own body weight in plank. and i kept on coming onto the mat and found that  seconds became , then , then  (still difficult lol) minute. 

i started to notice older people do yoga and how unconcerned they were with the way they looked… they just wanted to feel good.

so now, when i set my own fitness goals, i think about longevity and sustainability:

✨i want to be able to do things like tie my shoes, breathe in downward dog, and stand on my tippy toes when i'm hanging out with my future grandchildren

✨i want my joints to be free of pain so we can walk around the parks, beaches, etc. together

so i keep these in mind in my own movement practices whether yoga or weight training, because time goes by fast and i will be at that age sooner than i know. 

my body will look however it is going to look, but can i keep up with a lil grand baby crawling up and down the stairs?

this is why i prioritize

mobility,
flexibility,
smooth,
& easy movements.

and when have the space and time, i'll throw in the booty goal too.

Doc ID: 9754, distribution: 0.16739460822188165 ; for a long time, the idea of voluntarily running or following a youtube bodyweight workout would instantly bring me back to the days in my eating disorder when i'd tell my parents i was going to a friend's house only to drive to a track to run or when i'd stay up until  in the mornings doing bodyweight exercises in my room. i never thought i'd ever be able to enjoy either of those activities again because of the negative experiences tied to them.

when i reintroduced dedicated exercise into my life while healing from my disordered habits, i chose to only do movement i knew i'd enjoy, which for me, have been powerlifting style weight training, boutique style classes with empowering instructors talking through a mic, a whole vibe going on with the atmosphere, + bomb ass playlists, and walking.

coming into this quarantine, i was ready to accept that walking would be the only intentional movement i'd be doing (this would've been completely okay!!) because walking would be the only movement i'd enjoy. however, i was proven wrong! here i am staying at home and enjoying sweat seshes in my basement and even the occasional  minute jog in my neighborhood because it genuinely brings me joy.

while i definitely have days and weeks in this period where dedicated movement just does not sound good to me, so i choose to just chill at home or maybe go for a little walk because there is no pressure to exercise if it's not what will make me feel best, now that i have a healthy relationship with exercise, i feel like i've reignited a type of joy and passion that comes with trying and enjoying something new.  while working out isn't anything revolutionary and doesn't say anything about who you are as a person, it feels good to be here and give myself a pat on the back for how far i've come 🤍

Doc ID: 8852, distribution: 0.31560652589609467 ; After a long weekend class session (once a month we have class am-pm Saturday/Sunday), learning Sanskrit and the History and Evolution of Ayurveda, I walked into the kitchen and told Luke “I LOVE what i am learning.” I was a little shocked at myself after I said that.

I just didn't think i'd feel this way so fast. Before choosing to study Ayurveda (and going the Western Med route) I thought i'd have to grit my teeth through classes and material that is, yes, important, but not something I would use in my own practice. 

Saying so boldly that I LOVE what I'm learning was a big confirmation of my own growth and self acceptance. I'm really proud of myself for choosing what I want and trusting in my choice rather than staying within the lines that others have drawn for me. The last time I felt like this was when I was studying yoga (doesn't it all make sense?!).

When it comes to school, I'm pretty good at pretending something is important or interesting just to get a good grade. Actually enjoying the subject matter, on the other hand, is a different feel. 

I love knowing that the information I'm learning can help empower my future clients (you, maybe?) to take care of their bodies and heal with modalities that are gentle and natural. I love knowing that I don't have to be ~every~ type of practitioner to make sure a client gets the most thorough care. I love knowing that part of being a healer is integrating your gifts with the gifts of other providers who are equally as passionate in their field.

I'm sharing this because I have a feeling some people out there are also on the fence, teetering between what others expect of you and what truly resonates with you. I can't make that choice for you, but just know that it's never too late to choose yourself and your happiness ❤️

——
i always knew that i should workout from a place of love, but it honestly didn't fully click in my head until pretty recently.  for my entire life, being active was solely a way to "be better" whether that was through competing in sports, to look a certain way, or to just be “fitter”, which PSA: do not make you better. it wasn't until a few months ago, after i had gone through many phases of complete exercise burnout and around the same time that i went "all in", that i decided to let go of ALL expectations i set for myself in the gym and on how my body looked that my mindset changed. i'm not exactly sure when the switch happened, but my love for movement and this body of mine has never been greater.
——
some weeks, i make it to the gym  times, some weeks, i go  times.  EVERY week, i listen to and honor how much and what kind of movement my body wants and always give myself grace because at the end of the day, working out is a celebration, a privilege, and something to be incredibly grateful for 🌟

 Tips for stopping over exercising:  . If you are someone like myself who goes on walks that impulsively become runs, wear jeans/a dress/skirt so you can't run and/or get someone to go on the walk with you  . If you do yoga and you've found you've been going a bit hard at it, do a mindfulness exercise before and after your practice. This way you will be a lot more relaxed and less likely to get riled up and impulsively start doing push-ups or do crow pose too many times. . If you tend to do squats in the shower, something I had an issue with, set timers/alarms for your showers. Doing squats means you take up way more time in the shower, so by setting yourself an alarm you have less time to waste. Also if you are passionate about sustainability it could be useful reminding yourself that long showers aren't too good for the environment. . You gotta stop going to the gym. Just. Stop. Gyms are the best place to get riled up and uncomfortable and start working your body into exhaustion and you need to stay away.  . Give away/get a friend to keep any weights/fitness bands etc so you won't be triggered/tempted by them . If you live with your parents and they are supportive, I highly recommend sleeping in a room close to theirs. My dad once found me at am running back and forth in my room, and only heard me because I had been jumping very loudly beforehand. He didn't hear me before because I had a room far away from his and my mum's room. I have since moved into a closer room and it has stopped all nighttime exercise as they wake up right away . If you are in a team sport, I highly recommend you take some time off, if you haven't already been advised by your psychologist/health team. Although I understand you might love it, recovery has to be your first priority. Recovery has to come first. . If you end up exercising, have an extra snack to compensate. Something substantial like a banana smoothie, a nut/protein bar, yoghurt, avocado toast etc  
 You got this!!!

AND SO MANY MORE THINGS that have NOTHING to do with how my body looks.

growing up as an athlete, i LOVED moving my body and challenging my body to be stronger and faster and capable of doing things that made me feel really fulfilled. but, somewhere along the way, i picked up a lot of toxic diet culture messaging, and combined with developing an ED, my relationship with exercise got pretty messed up and confusing. i still enjoyed moving my body, but i also had become fixated on how my body looked and the impact exercising had on it. developing a healthy relationship with exercise took me a lot of years of trial and error, but i'm very happy and proud to say that my relationship with movement now is restored and better than ever!

reminders:

all movement is good movement.

when the pursuit of physical health prevents you from living fully in other areas of your life, it becomes unhealthy.

your eating and exercise habits are not your identity.

honoring your body can look like doing a workout even when it feels hard, AND it can look like cancelling it because it feels hard.

a rest day doesn't have to be an “active rest day”.

we could all eat and move the same way, and we would all still look completely different.

healthy behaviors are healthy regardless of weight changes or lack thereof.

As cheesy and overused as this quote is, it's the only thing that kept coming into my mind as the taxi was driving us away from the yoga school to the airport. My home for a month. Where strangers became family. Where practicing postures barely scratched the surface of the true meaning of yoga. Where I fell in love with my self again and again in each breath and stretch. I told myself I wasn't allowed to be sad until I left so I can enjoy the moment but my sadness from leaving pales to the gratitude I have for this wonderful time and the excitement I have for each person I met. I am much more happy that we all got to experience this together and I can't wait to see what light you beautiful souls spread throughout your life. You will touch lives you didn't even know you existed, and that makes my heart leap. Remember this experience but also live in the present moment because this is what is real right now.

There was a time in my life where I thought of working out as a chore or even a punishment, but I'm so glad to be at a place where exercise is something that I genuinely enjoy and do because I love myself instead of because I hate myself ❤️ Here are some things that I did to incorporate self care into my workout routine:

️⃣. Think about your “why”: Why are you working out? What is it doing for you? How does it make you feel?  It can be easy to get caught up in the numbers (number of reps, minutes, calories), but thinking about my “why” helped me track my progress in a more holistic way.

️⃣. Wear nice workout clothes: This might sound a little silly or materialistic, but when you wear something that makes you feel confident, it can really impact the quality of your workout.  Look good, feel good 😎

️⃣. Be your biggest fan: Chances are, you're your biggest critic. In the end, everything you do in your life is for you. The only person you are competing against is yourself, which means you get to set the rules and standards. Being your biggest fan isn't about bragging or being arrogant.  Rather, it is about showcasing your achievements and giving yourself a pat on the back for the wins in your life, big or small. Because if you don't do it, who will? ✨ 📸: @kaylabarnes

.
getting myself to start yoga this morning was so hard. i actually contemplated doing a workout instead of yoga. honestly getting to the gym early in the morning at this point in my life would probably be easier than diving into a yoga sequence. especially ashtanga, one that i've found to be more than bending and jumping.
.
its become more of a mental rather than a physical practice to me. when I resist it, I KNOW my subconscious is trying to stop me from being introspective. it's a telltale sign that my ego is trying to hide and go unnoticed so that I don't put it in check.
.
when i feel like i don't want to do yoga and force myself to do it anyway, feelings (such as unworthiness, feeling small, like a burden to others, feeling unaccomplished) and false beliefs about myself resurface.  these are all things that if left uncovered/undiscovered, pull me into a hole.

it's uncomfortable a LOT but so worth it at the end. even if nothing gets solved, even if all I do is realize “wow i actually felt like shit because of what happened two weeks ago,” I am at least % more aware than when I reluctantly began.
.
that's why daily practice to me is so important. I tend to bury feelings and hide from self deprecating thoughts so I don't have to face them. yoga brings everything to the front. yoga (slowly, surely, gradually) brings everything together.

Doc ID: 1702, distribution: 1.0 ; I put my dog down this morning. My first time ever experiencing that, all of my previous pets have passe naturally We had a vet come to the house to put him down here at home. I held him through the whole thing. It was scary.. I feel a hole ripped right through me. I have never bonded with or loved anyone or anything as much as i loved my dog, Poppy.Im feeling fucked up and trying to process all of this.. I guess if you are considering doing something like home euthanasia, feel free to ask any questions. Gonna go lie in a ditch and cry now

Doc ID: 23981, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: ur reply was cringey at best mediocre at worst the fact that me thinking that Belle might actually have good qualities set you off literally means it bothers you to such a degree that you felt the need to reply to it. so in other words, from a psych student: congrats, you played yourself. also her worth doesn't go away bc she tricked some horny dudes into paying her and in this economy hell yeah she's an entrepreneur. also. people are NUTS! no one expects their animals to get taken! chill out! Answer: im not set off im defending my position which im firm in. oh gosh an armchair psych student!! CREDENTIALS u DEF know what ur talking about. im not denying that she's good at scamming money out of people but theres nothing dignified or super smart about it. shes got the fan base so she's set. she could sell her broken nails like toopoor lmao. doesnt make her talented or responsible. which was my point. shes irresponsible. her “entreprehnuer!!” status has nothing to do with her being an idiot or a pedo panderer. when you're in her position you should expect the worst, because yes, people ARE nuts. if you're not making sure ur pets r happy safe and accounted for when you have a house full of people thats on you babey. u got lost in the sauce. then handled it like a reckless child. good luck getting that degree  anon

Doc ID: 24669, distribution: 0.5038521612897566 ; ive been stopping home each day briefly to care for my animals n plants but i have yet to stay / sleep there n im rly apprehensive bc idk im going to end up having to sleep at home tonight or what. i dont want to feel like im abandoning my animals again so i want to stay but im also scared shitless n not comfortable staying or sleeping there. ill probably do laundry and spend as much time with my animals as i can and then leave really late n sleep in my car outside of my work building idek anymore. avoiding everyone and hiding and trying not to exist is so tiresome

Doc ID: 24274, distribution: 1.0 ; second time within a month and fourth time within the year that someones broken glass in my driveway. just watched someone drive by  separate times throwing glass out the window. pretty positive its my ex from over  years ago. im so sick of cleaning up glass. im sick of cleaning up, in general. idk anyone who has to do as much cleaning as i do lol. between my  animals (and the other  that also live with me) and the garden and the nasty ass men i live with… and now this. i really cant take it anymore. any time someone drives past my house the glass breaks more. its am and i cant sleep because i just keep hearing broken glass. i want to sink into a hole and die this week is too busy for me i have too much to do to be losing sleep like this

Doc ID: 24184, distribution: 1.0 ; im so sick of this house. theres no air conditioning so i have to sleep with my door open or else ill sweat to death and the household cat keeps coming in my room and pissing on my only (expensive) suitcase and whatever clothing articles are on top of it, so my two bath towels. he keeps pissing everywhere. on the side of my bed, now again on my suitcase. im going to crack and kill myself. how am i even supposed to focus on wanting to do anything in life when i dont even have a clean piss - free space to live. its not my fucking cat or responsibility - i handle all my responsibilities and i still get fucked over on pissed on all on top of it. gonna be sobbing and trying to clean this suitcase today. a suitcase im probably never going to use again because my life consists of being trapped at this shitty fucking trap house and thats it.

Doc ID: 23072, distribution: 1.0 ; Every day is just agony and heart ache. I didnt expect to be this fucked up about losing Poppy. I mean, i did expect torture but this is a different kind of emptiness i havent experienced before. Im not myself. I dont even know who i am now that half of me is gone.  Im trying to feed myself but i dont have the appetite or desire to prepare food. I just eat rice crispy treats and cry. Im trying to work on art but i can only focus for a short while until i get too depressed and give up and go back to crying. When i lay in bed at night I watch shitty horror movies until i fall asleep to avoid thinking about the day I euthanized him…..  Im looking for work and hoping i get hired soon. I have zero structure in my life. Before it was Poppy's schedule: potty, medicine, potty, cook and serve food, potty, medicine, potty, food, potty, medicine, potty, etc etc all day every day my life was taking care of him. I loved it, because i loved him. Id give anything to help him up the stairs one more time.

Doc ID: 24022, distribution: 1.0 ; e-beggars make my stomach turn ugh. why is it so hard for ppl to get creative and grind. yal have safety nets & shit bought/paid for already and NOW youre expecting strangers to give you THEIR hard earned money too?? wheres the humility. if you need money for “food / transport / meds / car stuff / insurance” then why do you have venmo cashapp paypal AND a wishlist link in ur bio. putrid. truly. we all are struggling to afford our basic needs so what makes u think ur even entitled to asking strangers to feel guilty for u and transfer money that could be helping them TOO.  things u can do to make money when you absolutely have none and need it: apply at the closest mcdonalds. its hard to not get hired. if you can get hired at a mcdonalds within walking distance that is hiring, and you have nothing implicating or preventing you from doing that - you just arent employable. it aint shit but the starting rate is more than some office paper pushers make. and nobody is requiring that you work full time hours.  
 learn how to cam / sugar. if its do or die you put that mask on and you make what you gotta work, work.  
 learn to flip drugs. extremely easy profits. only requires one good connection whos willing to front you. and of course multiple smaller connections on the buyers end. you went to public school, didnt you? theres your clientele. doesnt even matter if they liked or like you. theres always a demand.  
 exchange a talent for cash instead of just plain whining about your life for it. can you draw portraits of people? can you offer to write papers, or do homework, or take on chores in exchange for cash? can you do ANYTHING at all? if you have the resources and capability to get word out to ask strangers for $$ ur def capable of getting an advertisement out with the same damn plea on it for exposure.  
 collect &take back pop cans and bottles 
 coinstar if ur lazy or change rolls if u have time to go to a bank. which u should have. if ur unemployed u have time.  
 start babysitting or petsitting. use a website or put up signs.  
 shipt or doordash if you have the means.  
 
 like its literaly so easy to make yourself useful. i know what its like to feel broke and helpless. but you never are. you can always go do something about it. even if its little.  instead of just publicly voicing ur entitlement to other peoples money and doing nothing SMH 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24827, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: what was it like being a sugar baby? Answer: not great. yeah the money is fuckin' nice, a few sessions allowed me to put new tires on my car (SNORT it was a lease and i had to give it back anyways ugh) & i went on a trip (not with the sd but with his $) but ultimately in my experience money aint worth it to be pretty much trapped for an extended period of time with a man you dont know well enough or trust. you have to keep up a constant facade, a perfectly curated persona of your ideal self. its very calculating and mentally exhausting. generally i hate all old men and want to drink their blood but being a sugar baby means making that old man feel like he's the most intelligent, personable, interesting motherfucker in the world. its a delicate dance and it can be dangerous. i was taken advantage of when i was inexperienced & my health was compromised on the greatest scale so it just wasnt worth it personally. id rather sit at a desk and waste away and read/watch whatever i want whenever i want yano. it'd probably appeal to me a little still if i didnt have my boyfriend bc my brain would probably be like OH U CAN DO A BETTER JOB THIS TIME bc naturally u do better the longer u do things i guess, and i always think i can outsmart these men but the truth of the matter is you cant sometimes. cant always predict them. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24421, distribution: 1.0 ; so i got let go today i feel so hopeless lol they told me i didnt do anything wrong. im good with customers, handled cash correctly, hard working, competent… im just not a “natural salesperson” ie nobody took the time to train me how to con people and upsell them way past their budget and nobody took the time to outline expectations so in the four weeks or so that i was training at this place, with ONE person, i never really felt inclined to do that because i didnt know i HAD to. and now i have no day job again. im so frustrated i was finally getting comfortable there and they were so fucking hard on me and my best is just never good enough. i overperformed, learned quickly, bent over backwards no questions asked … and it still wasnt good enough i feel so lost 
 and im annoyed bc to me weed is about getting ppl what kinda medicine they need. not raping their wallets and meeting quotas. subjectives aside, nobody ever told me what the OBJECTIVE was so what the FUCK im just following my goddamn heart and instincts. thru fuckin hoops at that 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24296, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: (just for weed btw lol im not into doing hard drugs)  Answer: oh what a relief i wanted to smack u. honestly, you wont find a dealer. they just kinda appear in ur life. dont trust anyone on the internet, the deep web has been gettin hit hard lately by the feds and all reliable marketplaces r down. instagram is pretty sketchy but a LOT of ppl do business on there and ive already met a couple girls on there who for some reason trust me enough to ship to them. i wouldnt advise trusting ppl like that tho bc … not everyone is me. most dealers dont have ya best interest in mine yano lol. if you live in an illegal state your best bet is to just go out in public and meet people and keep nonchalantly bringing up that u need a smoke until u find someone who has it or can help u get it. bars and pubs n clubs are okay, but like the kind of socializing is agonizing to me these days. try maybe an arcade, or like even a hockey rink if theres one by u. just show up, get a drink from the cafeteria. watch practices. eventually SOME boy will approach u and from my experience theres gonna be at least one guy on the team with weed so if ur committed - u can find him lol. shit u cld go to the library n meet someone who smokes weed. or get one of those friendship apps, make some new friends on there - swipe all the ones with “ friendly” in their bios lmao. id offer to ship to u but ur asking anon and idk where u live but yeah ur not gonna ever find anyone reliable lol. dealers r a different breed and since this has become my full time income i can really see why they get so unreliable and wacked out the way they do sometimes bc its an overwhelming business. i wouldnt ever expect a dealer to be reliable just assume they wont be. if u find someone reliable dont lettem go lol. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 23989, distribution: 1.0 ; locals got some nerve lmao  i worked at a dispensary for like  weeks and in the time i worked there i met a handful of people and all of them are turning out to be wack lol. you've got these budtenders bragging and pretending that they're cultivators on facebook (which ive now deleted)… which is laughable because budtenders literally just sell other people's weed. they are sales people, thats it. and its rude to pretend like you're an expert horticulturist when you dont know the first thing about how much work growing actually is. but thats sales people! even trying to oversell themselves lmao! and these same people are bothering me, hitting me up, asking me if any of MY CUSTOS want to buy a state licensed cart for $ off (LOL AS IF thts a deal) probably because they bought one for themselves and realized they dont want it. excuse me, but no lmao. how rude to even ask. you have access to an establishment full of customers that come TO YOU, of which i was fired from for “not having a personality” even though i was the most personable, knowledgable bitch there. my custos are confidential, not to be shared. and i dont fuck with overpriced, mass produced, state regulated product. rude rude rude. im sick of people asking me for favors when theres absolutely nothing in it for me, not even friendship. lmao. why am i constantly waking up to stupidity. between people not understanding or caring about my situation and thinking i have the means and time to easily sling for anybody but myself… to people expecting me to be able to procure rare illicits within a days notice zzzzzz … JUST NO YAL. im not a fucking genie. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24642, distribution: 1.0 ; dropped an extreme amountof money on car parts this weekend (fenders, a door… 😪 etc) and now im down to ahhhh basically nothing. i need more moneys im about to be out of weed soon and i refuse to ration. i'm out of food/groceries except for some cereal and english muffins for the next two weeks and idek if it'll last. my animals are accounted for but i wanted to start buying my ferrets raw meat and seeing if they like it but now i have to wait /: ive been spending a lot of time researching abt sourcing meat and debating my ethics but ultimately i want my obligate carnivore babies to be as healthy as they can and live as long as they can so i need to start incorporating death i guess. i want to start making edibles (because they help me sleep/eat and because they sell for $) but i need distillate and have no equipment to distill and UGH i just ugh. i need more money idk what to do ive exhausted all my energies and i have a ton of plants in veg but they wont be ready to flower and make me money for a while until they all get a lot taller. i be in a dry spell and im not adapting 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24414, distribution: 1.0 ; so today i found out the actual reason i got let go is because i “have no personality” 
 and here i was thinking i had a bad personality lol. to my surprise! i lack one entirely! 
 i cant fucking handle life anymore lol. i try so hard. i try my % best. and im still judged so harshly by management that spends no more than  minutes getting to know me aka asking for a copy of my drivers license and soc security card. i just dont know anymore 
 my boyfriend is at edc and has me blocked currently 
 my friends are trying to be supportive and tell me to “do what makes me happy because i dont deserve any of this” but nothing makes me happy anymore and im starting to believe that i do deserve all the shit that comes my way because its been unrelenting for the past few years. even the deer running out in front of my truck, im sure, somehow was my fault lol. idk what to do. i tried sending out resumes. indeed is scarce. nobody i know has any good opportunities for me, i feel like ive failed and missed all of them. ive locked myself in my room and i havent eaten or even peed and im kind of dying and need to use the restroom but i literally cant bring myself to leave my room because i feel like such a fucking failure 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 23174, distribution: 1.0 ; I've gotten l another art showcase coming up so i guess its a bit of motivation to get back on the recovery road.. Still dealing with my dog's failing health and its really getting to me. But this past week especially I've been feeling absolutely wrecked and I cant continue.. My body just isn't resilient like it used to be and I feel so awful physically. Im tired of it…  Its just hard, trying to care for myself when im so twisted up about my dog who i love so much.. But he knows he is loved. I've been sure to treat him as the most special little guy ever since we rescued him like a decade ago. He's my dog and im his person. He knows i love him. And i know he loves me. And it will all be okay in the end and I'm here for him when he passes… The vets wont let people in so if i have him put down they take him in alone. Fuck that.  Im so tired…. Mentally and physically and emotionally. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 23924, distribution: 1.0 ; cat update  hes doing a lot better today. actually he seemed better when i got home last night. the vets gave him a steroid shot so it mustve started working. he slept in between my legs last night and i let him out of my room at : cuz i heard the poor ole boy jump off my bed. id like to give him a little stepstool to get off my bed but the ferrets will just use it as an on-ramp to terrorize us both in our sleep lmao. i think my dad woke up shortly thereafter. i worried about him falling down stairs but it seems like hes got some balance back. hes quarantined in my dads room now with everything he needs. just brought him wet food. hes more engaged and reponsive, less confused and out of it. i just want the old guy to be able to die with some dignity 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24086, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: how did you get into growing?  Answer: my dad grew for a long time like + years & he didnt want to do it anymore bc its a lot of work. i took over his garden and had to bring all the plants he was neglecting back to life & i got rly good results so it kept my interest. i took over for the few patients he had and now i have my own in the mix too. the person im in a partnership with also showed me how to grow previous to this because we spent a few months living in / growing in a lake house a few years ago so i got to learn a lot before i ever even started myself. im lucky because i didnt have to throw down money for start up costs, all the equipment i have is old but it still works. all i had to do was nurse some plants back to life and pay the current maintenence which is still a lot of money lol. ive been doing it for a year or maybe a lil over a year but ive already faced quite a few challenges in the garden and learned more than i anticipated. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 1673, distribution: 1.0 ; Ive been laying in bed for the past  days straight because ive been depressed and have literally no reason to get up what so ever.No one is hiring, im self quarantined after seeing someone on the th so im not hanging out with anyone, i really dont like my family so im not stepping out of my room, i have no dog to care for so theres no responsibility, im too depressed to make art i just sit on the floor and stare at my unfinished paintings and assemblages. My online friends dont even talk to me or show any interest in RP like how we normally do.. My IRL friends dwindled to one single person who still gives a damn about me. so i really have nothing to do but lay in bed and be sad and reread old stories that my friends and i built together. Been feeling real fucked these days but i dont want to go to a hospital due to the virus So i just lay there and not off myself.But today i got a new digital drawing program for my laptop. My previous one was caveman era old. So.. Im out of bed, sitting in a chair, trying to learn new hotkeys. I guess thats kind of a reason to get up 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 24336, distribution: 1.0 ; its so annoying that i literally have  girlfriends left i can count on. nobody is ever down for anything anymore. ive been looking for a “garden assistant” to come over here and basicaly just WATCH me work while i teach them all my secret marijuana growing sauce, n help out here n there. trade their time for the knowledge. but nobody is interested or fit. nobody wants to make time.  people SAY they wanna learn but when it comes time to get in there with me and watch nobody wants to. they just wanna fuckin sit around and be lazy lol. nobody realizes the profit potential. and when i have other non marijuana gigs lined up - i cant even think of anybody id like to include because nobody understands professionalism and NOBODY I KNOW is really about PUSHING themselves at all costs like i am. so theres no point in including someone whos not gonna match my energy and make me look bad by proxy. its been this way my entire life. ive always wanted to include my friends on the way to the top but im realizing i dont have friends let alone friends with motivation to climb there with me.  
 alas ill do everything by myself and keep all my opportunities and knowledge to myself. i really dont need girlfriends. i never have. yal can keep complaining about your lives and doing nothing to improve or change the situation. not me. i aint got time for that.

Doc ID: 11397, distribution: 1.0 ; Whilst my hair may be a frizzy mess in this photo, it will be something that is forever very special to me. It was taken on one of my last days at home before I moved back to uni, and it will be the last picture I took with Star. 
Sitting here right now, crying whilst writing this, I cannot even begin to explain to you how hard these last two days have been. Following my exam on Friday I got the news that Star had very quickly become seriously ill, and she passed away that afternoon. 
Having only just turned  years old the other day, this has been such a huge shock to not just myself, but everyone else at home. It is crazy how suddenly life can just take a turn, and it is going to take a while to make sense of it all. 
If you have pets or have been an owner in the past, you will know that they are so much more than just animals with names that we feed, take on walks and care for. They become a huge part of your life, and this is something we only truly appreciate when they are lost. 
Going home in a fews weeks time and not being greeted by her tail wagging at the front door, or being able to take her out on morning walks each day is going to be so hard. I am thankful she is no longer in pain, but I wish I could have seen her face for one last time. I wish I could have at least said goodbye.
I love you Star more than than words can describe. You will never, ever, be forgotten ⭐️ 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 11219, distribution: 1.0 ; This post is, yes, for Berlioz. The house already feels quiet without him, and I find myself waiting to let him back inside only to realise he'll never come back home. His adventures this time end somewhere else, but I trust he's now at peace. He's safe in the sky shining with Star, and safely back with his brother just as they were as kittens.

As more than just furry companions living under the same roof, to me pets are family and a huge part of my life. And living with animals truly brings out the best in me. They bring positivity to my down days and make the best ones even better. They'll listen when there's no-one else to have a 'proper' human conversation with and sit next to me (or on me) when I'm channeling my inner yogi. They make me laugh, make me smile, and at times like this they'll surely make me cry.
-
Even though the patch of grey and white fur on my bed was all he left behind, I will never let go of all the incredibly special memories spent together over the past  years. They say cats have  lives and I know Berlioz lived his to the fullest, and the least I can do is thank him for being the most incredible tabby cat I'll ever know.

Rest in peace my tubby bear 🐾✨

Doc ID: 24732, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Forgive me if this comes off badly but lately everytime you mention your bf it's been in a negative light. I get that breaking up or leaving isnt always an option especially since I don't expect you to give the internet every detail of your relationship, but have you. fixing my car himself the  times it's been hit in the last year, helping me save money, helping me start an online business, helping with my grow & all the plants every other day when hes in the same state as me.  He's extremely neurotypical and I'm not so learning how to work together as a team can be challenging because we both have a lot of room to grow and we're very different - but we have a special bond and we're both very similar and committed to one another. The relationship has an added layer of difficulty because he does move back and forth between here and Cali so oftentimes we go months apart which can be challenging but even from k miles away if I really need his help, I have it. I dont think I deserve to be falsely broken up with repeatedly but his immature ass doesnt mean what he says and for some reason still wants to try to make this work so like anyone comitted to their DBS affliction, I'm gonna ride this one out and see where it goes. The last few days our communication has been better/more open so I'm really hoping that the mutual respect he claims to have for me becomes apparent. I really appreciate you being so gently concerned for my wellbeing and happiness. All the past relationships I've been in have been blatantly lacking and abusive and this is the first one I've been in that hasnt been entirely lacking and abusive so its hard for me to gauge when its time to give up.

Doc ID: 24158, distribution: 1.0 ; my night just keeps getting worse i literally just got my door kicked down and screamed at for being awake and playing video games at am. like sorry im trying to distract myself from violently sobbing til the wee hours of the morning… because i have an emotional abuser who loves to fuck with me from across the country and from a different time zone and i just read it and let him effect me and now i cant sleep because im so beat up and heartbroken. so sorry. that warrants my already broken ass door being shoved open with no warning when im literally just sitting here in my underwear playing a game. i cant get no fucking privacy and no fucking peace i swear to god im this close to losing my entire ass mind and getting the ryobi to drill my fucking entire door to its frame so i can stay locked in here until i die and decompose. what is it going to take for these abusive ass men to just leave me the fuck alone and stop pushing me every day every waking fucking moment. i cant even hide in my own room for fucks sake. everyone wants to know why im so crazy and blames me for everything thats wrong and talks so much shit to me about how SHITTY I AM but nobody ever stops to think that the way they fucking treat me is whats driving me to the brink of this madness. nobody can ever just leave me alone long enough to fucking recharge everyones just gotta make sure im in a CONSTANT STATE OF EMOTIONAL AGONY AND PARANOIA

Doc ID: 24731, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: I've gotta ask, why is being a sugar baby meetings with this man in private seem endless. you agreed to  hour sessions but he always keeps you over for at least . you're shaking with anxiety from the minute you step foot in his house. your friends have your location but realistically if something happens, they cant prevent it. your mind wanders to the boy your heart actually belongs to. you mentally over-exert yourself trying to keep up with this old man, perpetually executing this sugar persona that you've curated - a perfected version of yourself that you dont even believe in. you touch upon topics you must put much thought into before speaking upon. you eat, you drink, you get offered a massage. before you know it you're being fingered and finding yourself moaning not for pleasure but for special effect. you feel disgusted with yourself but you only have an hour to go and you need that fuckin' money. afterwards you must continue conversation as normal, as if nothing is wrong and you totally arent distraught by the fact that you just let a  yo man invade you. now imagine you agree to have sex with him. he doesnt tell you that he has herpes until after the fornication has commenced. you never even thought to ask because he was an AIDS doctor with his own practice of many years. he tells you that the herpes is dormant and non-transferrable on the medication he takes, he tells you his ex wife never got it. you spend the rest of your youthful years panicking every time you get razor burn - too afraid to ever tell the boy you love about your fears and anxieties. sugaring can be shit but camming is a different shit beast. the market is oversaturated and chances are your room will only be populated with broke dudes and trolls. if you want to make any money you have to be on for hours at a time, consistently, multiple days a week. everything will be recorded and archived. youll show up on anonib/reddit. people will dox you and find your real name. people will start revenge threads and blackmail you. you spend the rest of your youthful years constantly worried in public that somebodys seen you on the internet.

Doc ID: 24171, distribution: 1.0 ; so i fronted my “best friend” $ worth of product last weekend, til this friday… she didnt ask if i couldnt front her until she had already driven  hours here to come get it. i could desperetely use $ right now… desperately… and she's previously told me she only has “$” right now but then just just now she told me she “ordered herself a new vibrator itll be here friday” and virtually evety vibrator ive looked at on the internet is at least $ or more lol.  
 people rly out here letting their unemployed friends struggle and taking advtange of their friendship status while they spend money they dont have and keep themselves cushy n comfy. like if it werent for me she wouldnt be able to get high right now so how is it fair that im helping her out lol but i cant even buy myself groceries and i got debt collectors calling me and i gotta order my own animals more food and i just gotta sit here n wait for HER to get paid in order to do anything about any of that lol. how is that fair. it isnt. why do people just assume its ok to make their friends wait so long to get paid for something theyve already been provided with… especially friends who they know are hurting so bad for money

Doc ID: 23794, distribution: 1.0 ; ferrets, my entire life. dont know whats gonna get me out of bed every morning when they arent around anymore. still grateful for every day with them, every meal they choose to eat, and every poop i have to clean up.  
 having these babies for the last  years has taught me so much about myself, life, and others. taking care of two medically frail little honeybears, and having to take the time every day to handfeed luna for the last year or so has been extremely mentally challenging - especially so when my cat developed the brain tumor and i was tending to all of them at once. seeing the creatures i love like this has really made me appreciate health, and the little moments.  
 i never realized how my eating disorder affected the people around me when i was in the midst of it, but now that i've had to take care of an anorexic ferret - i see for the first time. i see how heartbreaking it is for family to see the person they love - unable to take care of themselves, or being too weak to have the will to live. i've felt the heartbreak, i've suffered from the grief of the unknown, i've REALLY come to terms with mortality, and most of all - i've mastered the art of being present. 
 i'm grateful for every day i have left with them, and i'm grateful i had this opportunity to live life with them by my side. still coping with fleeting grief and i'm sure there's more to come but for now i am grateful.

Doc ID: 24445, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: im sorry if im overstepping, but with all the posts you make mentioning your boyfriend it doesn't seem like it's a very good relationship :( i could be wrong of course but im just wondering why you stay with him, he seems kind of toxic Answer: ur no oversteppin. thats fair lol, i try not to post abt him too much. we can both be toxic. he claims to have plans for my bday now, “ its just a surprise” so perhap im being dramatic but i.. do get put on the backburner a lot bc his music career is about to pop off. hes leaving  days after my bday bc his music is bein played at edc and hes not even released yet so going means everything to him bc his career is everything to him hes extremely passionate and motivated abt music and its why i love him and its also why im sad n bein backburned all the time lol. its conflicting but like we make sacrifices. i admire him for having dreams bc all of mine died a long time ago. our relationship is ahhhh very complex but were learning as we go. he shows his love in different ways than i do and we're polar opposites but its worth it for right now because ultimately we do help eachother grow and no relationship comes without struggle and sacrifice, ours is just kinda amplified because his career isnt conventional and its hard for me to come to terms with but hopefully in the long run itll pay off. i could blab all day about all the shit he does and has done to help me, it just seems a bit sappy. my bday just depresses me blah sorry

Doc ID: 24273, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: What's the point of them throwing glass in your driveway? Does it damage tires or you think they just do it to make you clean up? Also why do you think it's your ex? Sorry I'm anon btw I know I'm not asking anything that warrants it, I'm just shy  Answer: i dont mind u askin at all lol dont apologize ive been shy my entire life i get it. im nearly positive its my ex because hes a fuckin hillbilly and he drinks bud light / bud light platinums and every single time its been bud light platinum bottles that have been thrown.  i literally have evidence lol i just went outside earlier and found another platinum label stuck to crushed glass. it can damage tires and yes, i have to clean it up. so both. /; idek. i dont know why they keep doing it, its been over three years since i got a restraining order against him and i dont wanna call the cops because theyll watch my house and go out of their way to drive by it if i say anything and i literally depend on selling drugs to pay my bills rn so i dont want that. my dad already warned me lol he knows whats up and what im kinda doing rn but not the full extent and he was really adamant about me beinf careful which is % understandable and obviously the protocol and involving cops isnt safe unfortunately. my ex's parents live three house down from me also, basically neighbors. my dad and my ex's step dad who occupies that house were best friends for like  years (but arent on speaking terms now) so he doesnt even want to go to them to ask. my ex has been hit by a car three times now in his life dont know why he isnt dead but anyways the last time he got hit a year ago left him really impaired with a colostomy bag i heard so… im assuming hes not doing concrete anymore and just living off the government because you cant do concrete when ur fucked up and thats literally all he can do. so im assuming he isnt working and moved back in with his parents. so hes around and probably has nothing else to do but drink bud light platinums and throw em in my driveway at am on a wednesday. i have a restraining order and he knows i have cameras at the front of my house but they cant see the end of the driveway. i heard it happen last night and i was awake and right in front of my window so i saw the car drive by, heard the glass, and then i saw brake lights  houses down just past the treeline where i cant see anymore, and where his driveway would be. idk just all the clues lead me to believe its him i dont really have any other active enemies. most of my enemies have come running back to me at some point to kiss my ass and apologize so im at a loss its got to be him. im honestly glad u asked sorry that was so longwinded i know im always vague and it might sound like im exagerrating lol but im totally not im so fed up with my life :')

 i just texted him to not even bother today bc i want to spare myself the disappointment while im ahead. im turning my alarms off and im gonna lay down and shut my eyes and turn off my phone and try not to cry myself into asphyxiation like i always do. if i sleep now i can get like  hours before i have to get up and move about and tackle school.  
 ive barely been eating lately because im so overwhelmed and its so hard to prepare yourself nice food for not a lot of money when you live in the arctic tundra and ur stuck at a college all day with student facilities that are under construction and a broken ass car with no heat. i feel so stupid. i cant save money. i cant take care of myself. i cant maintain peace for more than  minutes. as soon as my animals die im not gonna have a fucking purpose anymore. im not even gonna be able to think straight or rest at all. i cant stop worrying and anticipating. times like this when u wish u had a mom or someone to tell u everythings gonna be ok. ive always sucked at comforting myself. my natural reflex to emotional pain is self destruction, not self soothing. i dont even know what to do. the oscillating catatonic panic attacks and the detached depersonalized episodes have been alternating so frequently that im even neglecting to go to the bathroom as often as i should. i almost pissed myself yesterday morning and i actually did piss myself today. i dont know why i try to fight my bodys cues. i dont know why i can take care of everyone and everything else but not myself.

Doc ID: 24525, distribution: 1.0 ; i need ur help it takes  seconds
 
 so im entering a contest to try and win free tickets to go see flume (my favorite artist who's music has kept me alive since high school) in colorado this summer and this is gonna be a REALLY longwinded post but ill put the link here and if you “pre register” this little form for me aka enter a phone number and email for me, i get  points which helps my odds.  
 if you have more than five seconds, continue reading and i will elaborate on why this means so so much to me: tw abuse i wont go into detail but yeah 
 this would be the second time i'd be seeing him at red rocks. unfortunately my first journey across the united states to colorado was terrible. this was a few years ago, in / ish. i drove with my abusive ex, about  hours. he sexually/physically/mentally/chemically abused me the entire time we were there. the majority of the trip was spent in a hotel room, giving him sex.  
 seeing flume was an amazing life changing experience, hearing this extremely special music in front of a backdrop that's too beautiful for words. i even got to meet one of my internet friends for the first time at this show, she's a living breathing angel. this was supposed to be a good trip, but unfortunately i couldnt enjoy it to the fullest because of my ex. 
 im gonna try and explain this the best i can, sorry if its not cohesive. my ex convinced me to take cocaine for like the second time in my life at this concert, it wasnt my idea but he insisted. i could've been content stopping after my first time… cocaine and i do NOT mix but at the time i didnt know this so i just took it, i didnt see or predict the long term harm it would cause when i turned into an addict/abuser months later. to make matters worse, my ex bought it off a random wook who was lurking the parking lot before the event. so imagine this concert - im “coked” up on miscellaneous powder, and im doing my flow art. 

i “glove” for fun, its basically hand dancing but with LED lights attached to your fingertips with white gloves, depending on how you move your hands and fingers you can make shapes and patterns with the lights and its cool. its considered a “flow art” and its one of the very few things i enjoy doing. im listening to flume, flowing, feeling FILLED with love, and then all of a sudden my ex turns to me and says “can you stop doing that” so he could hold me / grope me to the music instead. 
 word to the wise, if you ever see someone EXTREMELY involved in a task, and they're having fun - dont ever, ever, ever, ever, ever… tell them to stop. unless there's a tsunami coming. that shit is heart breaking. i couldn't bring myself to enjoy the rest of the event or put my gloves back on, i just completely retreated inside of myself. all i could do was stare ahead at the stage and hold my own hands/cross my arms. 
 the night got worse, much much later after we dropped my e-friend back off at her home, we were driving back to the hotel in my vehicle. my ex started to lose his mind and was blowing red lights. literally would stop for the light, and then would go through it before it ever turned green anyways. i kept asking him what the fuck was wrong with him and to pull over and his only response was “i dont know sorry” and he would just keep going. back at the hotel, he threatened to fly home and leave me alone with my car across the country twice. looking back, i should of let him. 
 the one other time we left the hotel, i wanted to go to pike's peak. pike's peak is a k ish foot mountain. the weather was beginning to get inclement as we drove to the top. i am absolutely terrified of heights (have had recurring nightmares since childhood about driving straight off of mountains) and was crying in the passenger seat the entire time. there are no guard rails in most places driving up to the peak so you can imagine my terror as im letting this beans for brains of a man drive my vehicle , feet up into the air, he cant even tell green apart from red. when we reached the peak it was beginning to hail and thunder but i wanted to get out just to take a single picture to celebrate the fact that i made it… as soon as i got out and took my picture - lightning struck the ground no more than  feet in front of me and i felt it shock my feet, even with rubber soles. we promptly left after that. i kept asking the universe for a sign while i was there, and in that instant it gave it to me. not the sign i was looking for but a powerful sign nonetheless. 
 the rest of the trip was filled with tears and sex that i didn't want to have. an ATM machine ate my debit card in downtown colorado so i didnt have any money on me at this point. we almost didnt have enough money to get home, my ex had to overdraft his account and luckily we had just enough cash to get back. when we embarked on our journey home i was driving for about  hours when i got pulled over in iowa for speeding. my ex had gotten pulled over for speeding on the journey TO colorado but the cop had let us go. this cop wasnt feeling as generous, he illegally connived me out of my car, prolonged the traffic stop, bullied me into sitting in the front seat of his cruiser - and then he interrogated us separately. eventually my ex admitted he had weed in the car. we gave it to the officer. 
 the officer only gave me a possession charge even though the weed belonged to my boyfriend. this cost me $, that i did not have. come to think of it, this is the event that triggered the snowball of financial problems im currently still suffering from. i had to hire a lawyer in iowa so that i didnt have to go back there for my trials, he was the only lawyer who answered my calls. 
 after  and a half hours the cop let us go (on the police report he said i looked “drug sick” but told me to my face that he was only letting me go because “his niece struggles from an eating disorder too”… yeah i used that as an excuse.)  i blacked out from stress and hit my head extremely hard on the windows inside my car. that was the first time i gave myself a concussion. we barely got home in one piece lol. 
 the relationship was over once and for all after that - even though he said he'd help me pay for the charge, he never did. this same ex was stalking me at a festival a month later - , people there and somehow he found me and was following me at one point, aggressively questioning me and my now-boyfriend. then a month later, he attacked me and my now-boyfriend at another concert. i was facing the stage and someone punched me in the back of the head, when i turned around my ex was attempting to grab onto my now-boyfriend. everyone in the vicinity was getting hit and shoved, and it was chaos. my ex ran off before security could come. i now have a restraining order against this person but thats about all i could do. i tried to press charges but the courts messed up the case and dropped his charges. i worked with a detective, i drove an hour downtown multiple times, i showed up to court the first time EARLY, : on the dot, he didnt even show up. the scheduled him a re-trial and told me i didnt have to come next time, so i didnt. and because i didnt show up, they dropped his case. 
 super long story short i really want to go back to red rocks because since the last time i went there, my life has been nothing but trauma after trauma. i dont really have the money at all to buy show tickets and plane tickets but i will probably buy them anyways at some point and end up going alone if i have to. i have nothing else to look forward to in life and this man's music has single-handedly kept me sane and on this earth since  and i really want nothing more than to just feel reconnected with him again. this will be his only show in north america this year. 
 right now all my money needs to be going into fixing my truck that i have to turn back in, in july. flume will be at red rocks in august. if i can pull my life together and get this car returned with no problems by july, i'm going to quit my day job (which has had me extremely suicidal for months and months now) and i'm going to enjoy being car-less for a month or a few until i can save up for a new one. i will subsist on my garden money and maybe i will go back to college. maybe i will move out of the state. i dont know. all i know is that a lot of my responsibilities are worries will be alleviated by august. since the last time i went to colorado i've felt cursed since, and i really just want to go back and heal that part of my life that still hurts me a lot. i dont know. its a beautiful state and i'd like to try and make peace with it and myself. and i miss my friend, we're both so much more grown now and i'd like to hang out with her again while i'm not on cocaine/being influenced by a looming man thats dulling my shine.

Doc ID: 24243, distribution: 1.0 ; made my first pound sale last night 
 well not a lb lol i was an oz short so  whole ass oZ 
 decided i dont want or need a dayjob this morning LMAO i got priorities. wont catch me working for no more ole boys or chaldo fools because someone tipped me off that thats the situation i was about to walk right back into and it aint worth my gas or time 
 why would i do that when i literally just made .+k in  minutes. it cant be reasoned.  
 
 im bout to renew my late ass $ car tabs, take my ferrets to the vet so i can get luna more prednisone for her low glucose, and get stella xrayed for her weird persistent cough that she only does x a night… bout to make a bunch of phone calls to my car company bank etc get my current custo service nightmare sorted. bout to ship a package. bout to thin my plants and clean my ballasts. bout to walk barefoot in the grass bc sweet relief. money is definitely my # stressor and when money is ok, im okay. as long as i have enough to get by comfortably and know i can make more, im fine. at this rate i can even start saving lol. ive been putting in the work for months and months and this is first real time im reaping any bulk results. complete game changer.  
 everything happens for reasons mans i dont understand it or know why but life is always aligning for me at the very very very last seconds in every circumstance and scenario… just gotta trust the process i guess. its so gratifying to finally have big results. here i was pattin myself on the back for finding a new employer but ironically enough ive come to the conclusion (of course the day im expected to come in for training… always last minute) that i can finally get away with employing myself for the time being instead w/ no worries.. makes me wanna cry lol. i was gonna go in just to be professional but if i go for a day im going to have to go for a whole week or two to collect a paycheck and i already know i dont want to do a week or two so im just gonna disappear n hope they forget about me. i just reconnected with one of the og's of all things blackmarket out here who basically knows everyone worth knowing n already got recommendations (aka guaranteed hire) to better dispensaries if i decide thats what i wanna do.  feels weird af to even have these options lol. im gonna eat some fruit, smoke a hash joint, go lay in the sun n then shower. my girlfriends, all two of them, have been petty passive patties to me lately but thats okay im literally not even worried about them bc i can now occupy myself with all the plots and plans i have now that im in a financially breathable spot and can plot and plan. i blocked my copycat friend up and down, and evryone she knows, (or so i thought) and it literally took her less than  hrs to notice, figure it out, and text me. i found the weasle and blocked her too LOL. my other remaining friend has  interest in my life and only her own so i dont blame her ima just return the favor 
 its kinda fucked up but mostly relieving how many frustrations and doubts that money can truly solve for me. “money isnt happiness” but it is peace of mind which equates to sanity which indirectly equates to happiness.

  theres a lot of pros and cons and they all balance each other out. we dont have adequate time and facilities to eat good and that really bothers me because ive barely been eating on the three shifts ive put in but whatever i guess. and theres only  bathrooms, one for employees and one for customers which is bothersome.. but this is what i got right now. working with weed is like second nature so i wont bother complaining about the hypocrisy that management is already displaying rn.. &  im just too damn tired. its friday and i have an open weekend to do whatwver i want. i cleaned my ferret's cage and i let them run around until they passed out and i spent some money on a good dinner today to treat myself - i had a veg beyond burger doordash'd to me. my delivery driver was cool so i gave her a joint lol i hope shes enjoying it rn. im plopped rn but i still have to take a shower, pull a load of laundry out of the dryer, and put in some work in the garden. i just wanna sleep bc i only got like  hours last night but hey we out here making life work despite the world falling apart n all that fuck 
 
 
 random sidenote worry i have a consult on may  to get my wisdom teeth extracted. ones impacted lmao and i only have half of one grown in rn. im losing my mind over that but trying to not think about it too hard. i want braces again so i have to be big girl and suck the pain :') ufgh fuck if anyone has wisdom tooth removal wisdom pls shed it upon me bc im terrified of anesthesia and needles but also terrified of even being semi cognizant and awake for the procedure so idek what to do. ya girl dont got dental insurance either

 also scrubbed my ferret's cage clean. and cancelled my car insurance before they charged me on the th of next month :') and paid my bills and and got groceries and am on top of my debts. feelin accomplished and good physically. i hve to go to the community college tomorrow and see a counselor about signing up for fall semester. ive been going to bed at like /am routinely and i want to be at the office when they open at am so i dont know how tonight is about to pan out. gonna shower all the dirt and sweat and shit away and try to fall asleep but ill probably be wired awake working because i have cured plants sitting in my room that need to be trimmed and thats kinda time sensitive.  
 i just wanna be well rested for tomorrow so i can get that shit over with. i have a lot to trim before friday, and this girl i met on facebook circa  is gonna drive a state up and come pick me up so we can go to this art exhibition downtown together - im rly excited to meet her she's always been sweet to me.  
 i need to have this fuckening house and my life presentable before she gets here… but if i keep this momentum ill be fine. i just hope my dad isnt a jerk and fuckin ruins anything. i had a new girlfriend over the other day and i gave him a heads up and asked him not to embarass me and he screamed at me and told me to get out of my face. thank god girls are so forgiving. i came outside to greet her with tears and she was immediately sympathetic and asked if i needed to leave. showed up with smirnoff ice's n everything…. idk why im overthinking this i just dont want anyone to feel uncomfortable at my house because im uncomfortable / …. :') 
 its nice to have some people back in my life that arent men tryna power trip over me or play games with me. speaking of which my ¿ex?boyfriend is flying back in on sunday… and he is assuming that everything is fine with us, and is expecting that im picking him up from the airport even though a lot of hurtful amd toxic stuff has been said and done on both of our parts that i still havent rly gotten any closure on. but oh well. my dumb ass is just happy to see him. i have a lot of physical labor bullshit thats been piling up in my garden and i need some fuckin' help and we have a lot of eachother's possessions still so we were going to hve to see one another anyways. im just hoping it goes smooth because last time i picked him up from the airport was probably my # worst day out of the last  months.. and we both almost died.  
 i hope everyones doing ok managing whatever life is tossinf their way rn.

Doc ID: 24070, distribution: 1.0 ; :pm  i really have to pee :( but i have nothing to do with myself right now (as in, no way to stay busy) and i have no way of leaving the house unless on foot.. and im not comfortable walking around during the day. im actually way more confortable at night when less people are out and about and cant see me. i dont want to leave my room because i know if i do theres a chance that a fight might start because everything i do is wrong and my dad loves getting in my face to tell me how much im wrong and ill fucking break my hands into bloody stumps beating someone before i let them get in my face or my space one more time i dont care who it is. i feel like i dont even hve any space to call my own. i feel like all my posessions are just vulnerable even being in this house because at any time my dad could snap and break them or throw them out or his dogs will find them and ruin them via pissing or chewing. i finally replaced my doorknob like last week (that had been broken for  years due to him smashing my door in on multiple occasions) and he actually had the balls to tell me not to get one “with a lock” even though my old handle had a lock and all other doors in this house have one. AND i had the buy and install it myself even though he's the reason my door is broken. i barely have the $$$ for a sandwich because i have to save for my phone bill and paypal credit debts and ferret care/food/vet/meds, doorknobs arent really on my priority list rn. i dont understand why im not deserving of privacy like thats the one thing i cherish over everything else and i cant remember the last time ive had any. even isolated in here i feel like im being watched and listened to. this causes me to not play anything loud as to alert anyone to my existence, always using headphones or vol on low, not moving around or making noise, not being able to sing or dance or talk to anyone or generally being able to relax. i honestly feel like im living in the house with my mother again. it sucks that my dad had to change and now acts like her. and its hypocritical that hes always so quick to point out when he thinks im “being like her” but cant be held accountable himself for a damn thing thats wrong with him or tht he needs to improve on. if i told him that he makes me feel how she used to make me feel (a gentler way of saying HE'S BEING LIKE HER TOO) he'd just call me ungrateful. which is hilarious and ironic because thats something my mom used to tell me all the time. any time i was sad or hurt or had any emotion i would get told i was ungrateful, really. im  years old and my only means of comfort is clutching and smelling a stuffed animal, which i personally feel like i should feel ashamed of. when i was , , i definitely didnt think that i'd still be in the same fucking headspace with the same fucking issues. it feels like i've made  progress over the years. i dont even know how. i feel like i've been trying my best but i'm realizing that my best will never be enough.

THAT sauce. first i will display this cringetastic inbox shot and then i will give context and ill try to make it brief but I NEEd some input so please if u love juice and u have an opinion i could use u  so this is a person i met a few months ago - on my weed / bizniz instagram. he lives like a mile away from me and he pays me  an hour (nice) to help him gram out wax and trim and label jars n wtf ever. hes a bit older than me (//) but hes smart and talented at growing / processing rly quality weeds. so we have that in common. ive always had an innocent crush on him bc i like his nice teeth and nice tattoos and surprisingly his bald head bc hes not ashamed of it so good for him. anyhow i had a dream once that i licked him on the nose and ive been repressing my feelings since because hes already seen me thru some pretty rough weeks and i had already convinced myself that he thought i was entirely neurotic just bc .. its hard for me to hide lmao. shit, maybe he does and just doesnt care.. anywho innocent crush right. didnt think he was interested in me. im supposed to go help him trim tomorrow and thIS IS WHAT he sends me tonight like hello how am i supposed to handle this im in a relationship with an asshole that i still love and i dont like cheaters and i wouldnt want to be cheated on so i dont wANT to cheat but my boyfriend literally crazy makes me and has my heart in tangles and then theres this ole guy so cool n casual in the corner (LMAO) like “hhhbbrrggbb hey i wanna FuCK YEH”. like how endearing yano. im attracted to him but i was honestly just flourishing in my own sexual tension and i didnt know it was mutual so now i feel obligated to back off and just not see him but like (i actually really need money… and im out of smoke…… and seeing him tmrw guarantees both) (and i still like the.. seccual.. tensions….🥴) but im suppose to be a goodly adult arent i and to be perfectly REAL WITH YAL my vagina tingles at the thought of sex'ing him but THATS IT JUST THE THOUGHT. i dont want to do anything to compromise the mess im already in and i dont ever get away with shit, karma literally lives on my back and walks life with me every step of the way.  i dont even like thinking about it like that id just like to think that its wrong and bad but HEY HERE WE ARE and im most likely gonna go over his house tmrw anyways and idk how to gracefully ignore OR tackle the elephant in the room should it arise pls oh god yal i have  girlfriends weighing in on this i literally have nobody to consult what the fuck how do i handle this i havent felt giddy abt anything or anyone in so long it sucks that i cant just have this with the person i picked  years ago last time i even THOUGHT.

Doc ID: 17214, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: If just running around the house can contribute to your weight loss, should you be running miles or doing whatever other exercise you're doing? It seems like you're picking and choosing what you want to focus on "changing.". 🤔 Answer: Come back to me when you've spent hrs housebound with two babies, and then tell me that the chance to go run in the fresh air for - minutes on your own isn't the most amazing feeling and goes a long way to helping you stay sane. The exercise is not going anywhere. It's a healthy thing for me. My exercise levels have been very steady for a long while, and increased levels of running round the house can't replace a run outside or a swim. I just need to fuel that exercise properly, and that's what's been hard the last couple of weeks.

Doc ID: 15480, distribution: 1.0 ; I've been doing a Garmin k training plan during lockdown and now I've reached the end of the  weeks. Coach Greg is very confident I can now run k in  minutes but I don't actually think I can. And because I don't think I can do it, I don't want to even try.  Obviously I'm not doing a k race because because there aren't any races on at the moment, but I had planned to just go out and run the distance anyway. My plan is to do it tomorrow, if I can psych myself up to actually get out there. I've not run for a few days to give my muscles and joints recovery time so I can give my best effort but they still feel stiff. I'm just going to have to go for it and see how it goes. I'm trying to tell myself it's not a big deal (which it isn't!) but I hate not achieving my goals. I guess I consider this practice at that.

Doc ID: 15906, distribution: 1.0 ; Question: Just done the couch to k and now looking to slowly extend to k/ get faster at k. Any advice on training plans/apps?  Answer: There's a second app by couch to k, that's called “k trainer by CK” which I believe is meant to be good. Or there's several other apps that offer k training plans. I have a garmin watch and it has k, k and half marathon training plans included on it for free, and you can enter how many times a week you want to run and what time you'd like to aim for, and it targets the programme specifically for you. Plus it keeps track of all your workouts and it links with strava too. I've really enjoyed using it and found it helpful and it's hugely improved my running. So I recommend that if you're looking for a running watch/gadget - maybe as a treat for completing ck!

Thank goodness for having Apple Pay on my phone. Then I had to do the rest of the run carrying the water which was irritating but worth it because I felt so much better after rehydrating. I think Coach Greg was having a bad day when he set today's schedule. It was haaaaard. And it had this extra bit tagged on the end of the main bit that just felt like an unnecessary and spiteful little addition 😖

Usually when I even miss a week or two, I can feel the difference in the way I move through the water. Surely  months is going to make a big difference. My fitness is still pretty good from all the running I've done, but how my arms will feel is another matter. Also, the pool has limitations on the number of swimmers allowed in and I may not be able to thrash up and down in my usual way. I'm not sure if there's rules on overtaking or not. Basically I hope the fast lane is empty so that I can have it all to myself! We're going earlier in the evening than usual because the gym is closing earlier at the moment, but I don't know how many people will have given up their gym membership over lockdown. I'm not really desperate to go but I'm on a lifetime price freeze for my monthly membership, so I don't want to stop because I'll never get this good a price ever again. Maybe it'll feel better once I get back into the swing of it.

Doc ID: 9136, distribution: 0.24430866939250867 ; I couldn't figure out how to model these shoes w/o taking myself so seriously but I really wanted to tell this story
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
so, I had these shoes since high school. super cute right? but they hurt the back of my foot at my achilles heel (swipe to see) and if I wore them too long i'd get blisters from the way they rubbed the back of my feet. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
if i wore them not often and at short times, any blisters i'd get could heal in between each time. genius!!!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
i'd use them in an outfit that I knew i'd only have to wear for a couple hours (short party, going to lunch, running  errand). but I knew they were uncomfortable and i'd be f*cked if I were stuck out longer than I planned
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
common sense would tell me that I should just toss them if they don't work for me. but I would convince myself that they were so cute—I could deal with it! my pain tolerance is pretty high so it's not a ~big~ deal.

but just because you CAN do something doesnt mean you should...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
today I finally decided to put them in the pile of things to donate. I finally decided that my physical discomfort is not worth looking “cute.” I decided that I wouldn't keep subjecting my feet to pain just for a good OOTD. there's plenty of shoes for that, that won't hurt me like these!!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I wanted to relate this to food in the same way: why subject your body to a diet that doesn't work? a calorie limit that doesn't feel right? a number that reveals nothing about your soul?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
but i see it extends to many other areas of life: why subject your heart to someone who keeps hurting you? why subject your time to people who take it for granted? why subject your talent to a job that is holding you back from your potential?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
it takes time and multiple events for these things to really settle in and make me change something (i've been trying to keep these shoes for almost  years). but eventually I make a change and step towards love. I replace “you can deal with it” with “you're strong but we don't need to go through this today.” the question is... how long are you gonna wait to take your step?

It also perfectly summarises how I feel about it being Saturday rest day today. It gets to this point in the week and my legs are honestly exhausted. We've also done a lot of hill climbs over the past few days, and running in slightly warmer weather actually makes it so much harder. There is no linear relationship here people 😬😅

On this day I still like to get out walking with Bali and Java (oh and dress up as Milka's twin), but my focus is on stretching and rolling out my muscles. I also try to do a few select exercises that help to strengthen my hamstrings, because I've pulled it in the past (not fun at all) and it's particularly important if you're doing a lot of running.

It may be news to many of you, but I actually started off playing tag rugby in primary school and I literally lived for this sport!!! The teamwork aspect of it was so much fun, and knowing that I was a pretty good player on the team massively boosted my confidence, which still sticks with me today 💪🏻 I also tried a bit of judo, tennis, netball and then took to cross country running 🏃🏻‍♀️ In all honesty, I know I'll never be the best runner out there. But the high it gives me is like no other, and I never. ever. thought I'd be running my first ever marathon many years down the line 😅😉

Doc ID: 15208, distribution: 1.0 ; I had a fab run this morning with my running mummy friends - we ran a circular loop of . miles. It felt so good although it was about the limit of the distance I can run, I couldn't have gone much further. Unfortunately I twisted my ankle at the  miles mark. I was ok to keep running at the time but now I've stopped it's really stiffened up and puffed up a bit. So now I'm resting and elevating it in the hammock and H is waiting on me 😊

Doc ID: 15281, distribution: 1.0 ; Running from my mind  I'm not feeling good about myself at the moment. Perceived weight gain. Everyday I have a plan to eat less. Thoughts of “Everything would be better if I lost lbs” on constant repeat. Yada yada boring ed talk.  I went over on my ankle at the start of a run a few days ago, and although I did that run fine, it gradually stiffened up afterwards. I've been hobbling a bit but I'm hoping today it's better enough to go for a gentle run. I'm going to squeeze a quick  min jog in while the baby naps. I feel better when I move more and it helps keep me focused on what my body can do rather than what it looks like.

Doc ID: 17120, distribution: 1.0 ; I did the parkrun this morning. H and the baby came to cheer me on, which was lovely. I've been in a slow running phase since April, just can't seem to find my speed again. It's probably related to not really having much chance midweek to get out for a run. I was .min slower than my pb on this course, but I was still happy with my time. It was  mins faster than last week (that was a slow two-baby-exhaustion run) so I feel good about that. Plus it helps me believe I'm not dying from some mysterious illness that I don't yet know about. Whenever my exercise tolerance goes down, I have a list of conditions I immediately convince myself I have.

With one eye on the weather forecast (looking at you Storm Dennis), I incorporated the parkrun into this weekend's  minute easy pace run to get it all done before the weather did its worse. Uff I could run fine at easy pace but when I tried to notch it up a level for parkrun, the tiredness in my legs from Thursday's long run was real. Anyway, I got round, the run is done and after a hot shower I'm curled up on the sofa in comfy clothes watching an episode of The Pottery Throwdown and feeling very little motivation to do anything much more. Except eat. Omg I'm hungry. I've had breakfast, lunch and snacks. Trying to remember T's words to Trust My Body. If it's hungry, it needs food. I may need more snacks shortly.

Doc ID: 15715, distribution: 1.0 ; One mile time trial  My k running training schedule had me run a one mile time trial for the last two Sundays. The first time wasn't so bad because I'd never done a time trial before ever so I didn't know what was coming. The second time, yesterday, oh my goodness it was hard. I went out too fast and then just wanted to give up and walk 🥵  There's a really convenient road loop not too far from me that's exactly a mile long but the corner I started from means that the first half of the mile is slightly (only slightly) downhill and the second half is slightly uphill, so even harder to run. If I have to do it again, I'm going to start from a different corner!! I was so relieved when I'd finished and my schedule revealed next Sunday's run and it was a long run rather than another time trial.

My run wasn't too great–the weather is really starting to get to me. But I'm still proud of the fact that I went running at all! I was so, so close to changing my mind when I started grabbing for my workout clothes, and when I started running, I almost convinced myself to stop early and walk instead. But I pushed through! A shorter run is better than no run at all. Tomorrow will be a full week binge-free, and I'll be a third of the way to a rest birthday present to myself!

But I was smiling to myself under the sun, I felt super energised, and I was honestly loving the podcast I was listening to all about vegan athletes.

Feeling super inspired, I thought I'd answer the question WHY I RUN 🏃🏻‍♀️ I want to film a 'running story' video and also a Q&A all about running (both are on my growing list of videos to film 🙈), but I thought I'd share just a few reasons here first.
-
 // It's a reason to go outdoors and get fresh air. Personally, the UK spring weather is usually optimal for me: not too hot, not too cold, a bit of a breeze. But whether the heat feels claustrophobic or my butt cheeks are hideously numb, it's fresh air and that's what matters most to me.
-
 // Recently, I'm running with the half marathon in mind. And that means I'm working to beat my previous time, run faster, or run a longer distance. Challenging myself with running has made it so much more exciting and rewarding.
-
 // I think everyone's probably heard of endorphins. With any form of exercise you get that positive feeling afterwards, but for me, endorphins are on an all time high after I run.
-
 // Stress relief. At my desk, there's a million-and-one things going on inside my head all at the same time. Whilst on a run, it's a chance for me to escape that chaotic bubble and just be in my own company.
-
 // Running is for anyone and everyone. For sure you have to train pretty intensely to be a pro runner like Mo Farah, but it's so easy to just put on some trainers and run. And simply run for fun. I also love running to explore and find new places, which is something I loved doing in Australia (except in Darwin . . . yeah, about that 😭🏥).

Happy Monday my friends. I hope this possibly gave you a small dose of inspo to maybe go on a run this week 💪🏻

Doc ID: 16042, distribution: 1.0 ; Running Madness  I've been really trying to eat more carbs and I think it's paying off. My runs this week have felt so much better than last weeks. My legs have felt good and my times have been faster. Today I was scheduled to do a  hour long run. I set off and it was going really well. One of those runs where I just felt like I could keep going and going. I was about  minutes in, going steady back in the direction of my car when I got a phone call from H to say my tutee had arrived 🤯 Eek, I had forgotten all about her coming today. She only comes once a month, but I had been thinking about her earlier so I don't know how it all went clean out of my brain. I blame the sleep deprivation. H had to come out in his car to scoop me up from my run. I was really gutted to have to cut it short because it was feeling so good. I put a sprint on to get as far as I could in the last  minutes or so, and surprised myself by how much of a spurt I could do after  miles. When I'm actually running the half marathon, I will have to think of tutoring at this same distance point and visualise the same situation and whoomf! off I will go. In the end, I made it to . miles before H caught me up in the car. He whizzed me home (I was very grateful!), and I spent an hour tutoring Circle Theorem, before shoving my (cold damp) running clothes back on and running  miles down the road to rescue the car from where I'd parked it at the start of the run. Finally made it home just in time to eat tea cooked by d. Madness, I tell you.

Doc ID: 17171, distribution: 0.4059614489385187 ; rd August  I think I've hit a bit of a wall! My get up and go has got up and gone. But I carry on, just rather wearily, like ploughing through treacle. I did the parkrun this morning while H had the babies and took the car to get a new tyre. The tyre took longer than expected but he did eventually manage to meet me after the parkrun and we went for a coffee in the same outdoor cafe as yesterday. Parkrun was a slow one. I knew I didn't have the energy to push myself so I just took it steady but even so my legs were running on empty. I think I am probably exerting more calories than I'm taking in, even though I'm stubbornly pushing myself to eat three meals a day and mostly succeeding. I think I should eat more but my rigid brain doesn't want to bend that way. This afternoon we have hung out at home, taking it in turns to entertain the babies and do jobs. I managed a nice period of one-handed jigsaw doing (I was bouncing baby  in the bouncy chair with the other hand) outside in the warm weather, so that was good. A little bit of (almost) me-time. H and I also took it in turns to each have a short nap on the sofa. Now it's the evening. We might get a Chinese takeaway later but H and the girls are out, and I am home with two sleeping babies, so I'm waiting for the others to get back. I'm sitting with the remaining mess of the day around me, and ignoring it while I drink a glass of white wine and try and catch up with the babies' daily diaries. I'm supposed to write in them every day but I'm pretty rubbish at remembering and always end up writing a few days at a time. I really hate to admit it, but I think two babies for three weeks may be my limit.

Doc ID: 15945, distribution: 1.0 ; I finished my half marathon training schedule!!  So even though my race is cancelled I thought I'd still get out and run the distance. I had a vague route planned to stay local to my house but it turned out to be not quite long enough so the last few miles were made up of random running on side streets (all appropriately socially distanced, of course). I think I'd definitely be slightly faster in an actual race with spectators and a defined route - and also if I wasn't so sleep deprived and if I'd been more careful about adequate pre-race nutrition I'm proud of my running achievements over the last three months. I never thought I could run the distances and the speeds I've run. I don't know if I'll ever be able to run a half marathon as fast again as I would have done this one. Certain factors just aligned over these three months that meant I could fully commit to training. Who knows whether that'll happen again. But let me look at the positives - I trained in a healthy way, I didn't get obsessed or let the eating disorder run away with it, I stuck to the training plan, I maintained my weight, I paid attention to my nutrition… lots of wins there. Super proud of myself 🙌

Anyway I'm making slow progress with it. Today I have a fairly clear day so I'm hoping I can crack on with it. The deadline is about  days away so I know I will have it done by then. I can't think about much else until it's done though. Still running as per my half marathon training plan. Yesterday I did some things called Stride Repeats. I have no idea if I did them right. I read some stuff and watched a video on YouTube and I'm still a bit hazy about the differences between stride repeats and speed repeats and intervals and things like when the training instructions say “challenging run; fast pace x minutes/mile ; no sprinting”…. I'm not sure how to run challenging and fast without sprinting. At that pace I am sprinting 😭😂. I will just keep taking one day at a time with it and trust that it will get me where I want to be by the end. Today is a rest day and I will be resting. No running.  Btw I see your questions in my inbox and I will try and get to them when I can.

- 
Even though I found out I was running the marathon in April of this year, I only officially started training roughly three months ago because I had some foot issues, classic Holly 🙄😅 I did also start out with a running coach, however this didn't continue throughout. I ran four times a week consistently for the majority of my training, with each of my sessions being varied, and my long runs were always part of my Sunday routine. The longest distance I tackled before the race was km and I started using my energy gels when I was running for longer than  minutes 💦

Coming down with an achilles injury with only a week to go really did get me down, however now that I've crossed the finish line I can definitely say that my training really did pay off! I ran so much faster than I expected and I don't think I would have been able to do it without the crowds. I knew they would be good, but not *that* good, and wow, people literally screaming your name is *the* best form of motivation ever ok, period 🙌🏻

Personally, I feel like my running has come a long way over these past few months of training. I've now conquered my longest distance that I'll do before the race (km which I filmed in my last marathon training vlog).

It was going great until my garmin battery died at . miles 😭 I had to use Strava on my phone to get the extra . mile and now my upload is all a mess. But I did it and that's what counts. A bonus side effect of running that far is that I need to eat a lot of food to replace the calories and to stop my hunger going haywire. I don't run to burn the calories but when I'm in a good place with food, I like that it happens.  I finished my jigsaw and this afternoon collected another one I'd bought from a local selling site.

I was really tempted but I knew I couldn't do that and the half marathon training and stay mentally healthy. Ironic since it's for mental health, but running every day for a month would actually be likely to send me spiralling into a relapse. And that, brain, is why we are not doing it.

Here's yesterday's run and today's run - I'm very much in need of a rest day tomorrow! Yesterday's run was a steady pace for hr  and then  mins fast and  mins very fast (plus warm up and cool down). Today's run was just  mins steady pace. I listened to a podcast instead of music for the first time while running, and was pleased to find I could concentrate on it pretty well. I have actually got pretty good at running and don't know in what way I will carry it on when this training cycle is over. Maybe I'll follow a new training schedule to improve my km time. I've really loved checking each run off on my garmin and looking back at my stats for each run. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 15358, distribution: 1.0 ; Running  I've started a new running training plan although it's not really a plan because I'm trying to have a break from a hardcore plan and just have a bit of focus to my runs instead. It uses heart rate instead of running pace and that feels more gentle and takes into account the varying terrain I'm usually running on.  It will make my easy runs more easy because I'm trying to keep my heart rate down. Hopefully this will mean I hurt less afterwards. I've done almost  months hard running training, so I'm ready to ease off a bit. I don't want to destroy my joints. I want to still be able to run next year. I really like running. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16174, distribution: 1.0 ; Two-run-Saturday   I've been for two runs today. I didn't plan it that way, but I went to parkrun (got a PB, yay!!) and then came home and looked at the weather forecast because I heard rumours of a big STORM approaching. Seriously looks like it's going to be hard to even stay upright never mind run, so in the afternoon after I'd done an hour of maths tutoring, I popped back out to do my  minute “easy run”. It is easy, it's at a very steady pace, I just put my headphones on and trot along enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. So now, run done and tomorrow can be a rest day with all the wind and rain from Storm Ciara. I think it might still be bad on Monday when I am scheduled to run, but I will deal with that when we get there.

Doc ID: 15968, distribution: 1.0 ; Lockdown Day   These lockdown days seem to get so full up of stuff that I barely have time to get on tumblr, which is sad because it makes me feel disconnected from all my tumblr friends. Eating has been somewhat better today, although after doing PE with Joe (and d, d and d), I went for a run (my one allowed daily outing for exercise). It was the penultimate run of my half marathon training schedule, a tempo run with  minutes warm up jog then  minutes at fast pace and  minutes cool down jog. My legs were dead, I don't think Joe's PE was a good pre-run idea. For the first time ever in the entire training schedule I skipped the optional extra part of the run, so I only did  minutes fast. Then walked home for the cool down. I didn't eat enough yesterday and I exercised too energetically this morning and it came back to bite me at pm when I crashed out on the sofa. So none of that was great.  On the positive side, the weather was so sunny and warm today, I started to wonder if I should have worn suncream for my run. It's been beautiful and we've been sitting out in the garden enjoying it. I want to write about therapy - last week and this week. I'm hoping I'll have time to do that tomorrow. I am in need of a peaceful day just pottering around rather than frantically trying to do jobs and take phone calls in between the baby's schedule and trying to keep on top of everything as much as I can for the girls. In other news, we got Disney+ yesterday and everyone is very happy. I'm not really bothered about watching it (no time haha) but I'm happy that everyone else is happy. Since the gym is shut, we get a rebate of our gym membership which will more than cover the Disney+ cost so that was our justification. Plus we need things to do in these lockdown times. Of course our daily appointment with Boris at pm. He wanted to be remembered for Getting Brexit Done, and instead he'll be remembered for Getting Us Through The Coronavirus Pandemic. I don't like him and his party and policies but I do think he's doing a pretty good job overall of this. And Chris Whitty and the other guy (Prof someone) will be up for knighthoods when this is all over I'm sure. This evening we had a Zoom with our church group and that was lovely to see everyone and give thanks for the good things in our lives and pray for each other's needs. Very encouraging. I'm heading for bed very soon now so I'll say goodnight. Stay safe and healthy everyone if you can x 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 16904, distribution: 1.0 ; Run  I went for a run this evening to try out my new garmin. It was a lovely evening for a run, beautiful sunset, it just felt great to be out there running. I wasn't running because I felt I had to, or because I felt I needed to compensate for anything. Just running for the pleasure of running.  Of course it doesn't feel physically fantastic all the time when I'm actually running. The route I ran is uphill for the first couple of miles and it's hard work, but then it gets easier. After about three miles I got into my stride and was just cruising along feeling good.  Six miles down and I made it home, walked d out to a babysitting job, and then came home and ate a bowlful of creamy lentils and pork (Thankyou hello fresh) The garmin did its thing and I managed to make it record my run and upload it to strava. Whoop! Now I'm in my pjs and watching the final episode of Sink or Swim/Stand up to cancer. I've loved this little series. Totally inspiring.

Doc ID: 14930, distribution: 1.0 ; About to get out of bed and get dressed. Shall I a) put on my comfy lounging around clothes or b) put on my running gear in the hope that it might motivate me to get out for a run? Since we are in lockdown, there's not a whole lot of choice for an activity besides going out to walk or run. I can't swim this evening as I usually would, since the gym is closed, so maybe a run would be good.  Ok, I've talked myself into it. Running clothes it is.

However. The most important thing is that I didn't feel any pain in my achilles and it wasn't stiff afterwards, which is THE BEST THING EVER 🎉

Doc ID: 15475, distribution: 1.0 ; I did it!  This morning I did my end-of-training-plan k run. I imagined I was going to do a parkrun, although I didn't run a parkrun route because the parks are so busy at the moment. So I got up and did all the pre-parkrun things I usually do and that helped me get in the mindset of going out to run k. It also made it feel less daunting because I don't really get stressed out before parkruns.  I didn't quite manage it in  minutes, but I was just over  and a half minutes. Strava tells me that is a k PB so I'll take that 🙌 I think the parkrun where I ran slightly faster probably was measured a bit short as it didn't register as a k on my garmin. Anyway I felt like dying while I was running and had to use some mental toughness to keep going but now it's over I am feeling awesome. Tired out but awesome. I'm glad I pushed myself to do it. I'm going to try and have a week or so off running I think to give my joints some recovery time. I've done two  week training plans just about back to back since the start of  and run  miles. I've read about training plans where you adjust your pace to keep your heart rate in certain zones, so I might try one of those next. They apparently improve your baseline fitness and don't involve a lot of fast running. But for now, the sofa calls, along with my book I'm trying to get read for book group tomorrow evening. I'm off for some restful reading.

Doc ID: 10807, distribution: 1.0 ; The hardest race of my life. 😳🥵
-
Now I haven't completed that many races in my life ok. But from what I've heard, road marathons are the toughest distance to run . . . and I wouldn't question that at all 😅 Both times I've run London marathon it definitely hasn't been easy. I've pushed my body to the limit, but wow the km of Phuket marathon were a whole other ball game the other day!!!
-
A am start. Crazy heat, hills, humidity and a heart rate way too high, it was a recipe for disaster I won't lie 🤨😳 We both started off too fast, and everything quickly went downhill at K into the race. At that point I also had to sadly call my race over, because both our legs were cramping and I felt very nauseas. I was burping like a baby you guys (no joke 😂) and nothing was staying down too easily, my gels and even water 😔
-
Now running in Thailand, or anywhere hot in the world, should never be taken lightly. It's crazy out here you guys. But Sunday's race was such an experience. Both mentally and physically I was definitely challenged, and I cannot wait to share this video with you all so you can truly feel my pain as the sun was rising over Laguna (which truly is stunning, I promise) 😍
-
And you might find this hard to believe, but I truly loved running that race the other day. The best part was being able to run with Angelo, basically for the whole race, and crossing the finish line with our names being called out (representing Great Britain woo 😆) was so so cool I can't lie.
-
So Phuket, thank you. I'd love to go back and run you again, but for now, I am taking my rest game very seriously 😉

Please ignore my red tomato face but wow, I seriously had runner's high afterwards you guys!!! I did this same distance two weeks ago but I definitely felt better during this one as I was using my proper gels (which work so well for me👌🏻) and hydrating more regularly throughout 💦
-
I'll post this run as a reel tomorrow with all the deets, but I am really chuffed with myself because I've been working on lowering my heart rate all week, so that I'm training in a more sustainable zone as it were, and I can hands down say that it definitely makes a difference 🏃🏻‍♀️ I forced myself to run a bit slower but it was % more enjoyable 🙌🏻

I am honestly liiiiiiving for my morning runs at the moment. Find me an interesting podcast and I'll just keep going, and going, and going.

Doc ID: 14811, distribution: 0.27368806836858617 ; It's so difficult to keep prioritising eating while life is so busy these two weeks. I'm reminding myself missing meals is not helpful and will only make coping with everything else going on more difficult. So I am doing ok, but it's taking effort. I'm also having to give myself grace over running. I like to get out and run a few times a week, but at the moment having a gap in my day to run and having motivation to run are not really coinciding. There's days when I'm not really moving much at all, I think a couple of days I've not even gone outside, which is very unusual for me. But it's only for two weeks and nothing awful will happen to me if I don't run much for two weeks.  Basically adoption transitions are hard and all-consuming. You're looking after a baby, and then you're looking after adults learning to look after the baby. And you're doing it from dawn till dusk day after day. We have all hit a bit of an exhaustion wall today so we are having a very low key afternoon. One more day to do and then a day off, before the final push to the end. I can't even wish for it to be over though because that will mean baby leaving us and that's just sad too. Much emotions.

Doc ID: 15623, distribution: 0.16123950984383334 ; I hurt so much today. My left hip is bad and I'm really hobbling around and struggling on the stairs. I still ran this morning,  miles but at an easy pace, and I did PE with Joe but took it easy, didn't do any of the jumping. I should have taken a rest day from running but I hate not sticking to the program. Tomorrow will be a proper rest day from all forms of exercise though, hopefully my hip will ease up a bit as I'm due to do a long run on Sunday ( minutes, so not *massively* long). Last Sunday I went a bit rogue and ran  miles which took longer than  minutes but I was on such a lovely big loop of a route I just kept going. I know I am not helping myself with continuing to run, but I'm always in denial and hoping that it'll go away if I ignore it long enough. It's kind of worked so far so that doesn't help me make sensible decisions. I've just taken a couple of ibuprofen and I'm hoping that'll help my joint pain. It's not about restriction or burning off calories, it's just my so very unhelpful black and white thinking.

Just a casual . miles later and you guys, I'm officially a marathoner 🥺 I honestly cannot believe I crossed the finish line in  hours  minutes 😱🙈 I said at the very start of my training that I'd love to run a sub- hour marathon, and then it became sub- hours  minutes when I found my rhythm . . but those times had to go out the window with my achilles injury at the start of last week. I even thought I may pull out last minute 😖😢
-
I'm not going to lie, the race was tough! So so tough, physically and mentally. It felt like my achilles was snapping at the half-way point and everything went downhill in the last  miles 😅 The surprise finish will also all be explained in the vlog, because it's definitely a story to tell 😂 
-
However, the atmosphere was insane and the crowds were honestly amazing!! London, I freaking love you 💚

Huge congrats to all the other runners yesterday and I, of course, need to say a huge shoutout to the fam for capturing some epic moments on camera, @murderedabroad for offering me this opportunity in the first place, you guys for supporting me throughout this whole journey, @sportsshoes and @newbalance for kitting me out, and my legs, yes my legs, for not giving up despite the pain 😉

Answer: I haven't run on a treadmill for ages. Running outside is so wonderful - fresh air, familiar but changing scenery, uphills and downhills, things to look at, routes to explore…. I can't imagine ever choosing a treadmill in preference. The only reason I might run at the gym is if the weather was really awful. Plus I'm training for a half marathon and that's running outside, so what better place to practice than outside!

 I see… so many writing advice posts on Tumblr that can single handedly kill a young/beginning writer's style that it makes me want to scream sometimes.  
 Let yourself be messy in writing. If artists are allowed to get paint over everything, including themselves, you're allowed to have choppy sentences where the rhythm is weird and where you, god forbid, used an adverb. 
 Be the literary equivalent of an elementary school art class and be wild, innovative, and try new things out. In the end you'll have created something you had fun doing rather than trying to fit yourself into a set of rules set forth by “Who Knows What Their Credentials Are Besides That They're A Creative Writing Major”.

Doc ID: 2908, distribution: 1.0 ; Currently experiencing a monumental moment: I just placed my own book on my bookshelf... To celebrate, here's a sneak peek of some of the interior artwork! I remember drawing sketches of my characters, creatures, places, etc. while writing this book, I had them pinned up all over the wall above my desk. When I met my incredible artist, @cesar_does_it, we ended up speaking everyday for a solid four months, and I sent him photos of the very same sketches from my wall. He then went on to make them the AMAZING images you'll see all throughout my book. Seeing all of it on these pages now is completely surreal and I cannot wait to hear what all of my readers think! 📚🙈

Mine is decidedly less legible and more scribbly-scrabbly).   For the recovery community, especially those of us coming out of trauma backgrounds, this poem articulates well the struggle of leaving behind the past and finding your own True Self.   I hope you are beginning to find your voice, however slowly it may seem. I hope that you keep moving forward, even when the voices of abusive people or past pain pulls at you to turn back. I hope that you choose to save your own life, because it is the only one you can save.

Doc ID: 12171, distribution: 1.0 ; My midnight drawing muse: the creative and ethereal goddess, Florence Welch✨ In an interview with Vogue, she talked about sobriety & recovery, saying: “It is an act of rebellion to remain present, to go against society's desire for you to numb yourself, to look away. But we must not look away.” I think also of the line in 'Light of Love' that goes, “In some ways that was simpler, being too fucked up to see - I didn't have to wake up to the world that was around me.” Aside from loving her artistic style, I resonate with her honesty about recovery. It does feel safer and simpler sometimes to stay in a fucked up state and be numb.  Tonight I think of the courage of those rebelling against that desire for numbness.

Doc ID: 12619, distribution: 1.0 ; This is a weaving project I made in art therapy over the last two weeks as a reminder of one of my beliefs, an image that has been holding me for a while and centering me: the image of god weaving together the messy threads that I hand god for something whole and beautiful. the image also reminds me to not let myself fall into despair and fear about the future, which is really easy to do these days, but to hold on to a stubborn, tenacious hope. 

 the world is dark, but take heart. 
god is still weaving.

I had a whole life reflection written out but I decided to keep it short. a lot has changed since then. but also not that much. i'm still figuring things out and learning the ins and outs of me. i'm not fixed on an end goal as much anymore because there are so many things i'm pursuing that to “wait” for each thing to happen would be pure torture.  the magic of the song not at the end of it, but is subtly weaved into the melodies, harmonies, beats, bars, verses, and bridges. I want to sing along.

Doc ID: 12127, distribution: 1.0 ; I WROTE A NEW SONG (in case you were wondering) Co-written with incredible Carrie Welling.  This is not how I wanted to share it - I wanted to drive to Nashville and get a quality recording. But it doesn't look like that's in the cards in the near future, so you're getting it early. I was told many years ago (half-jokingly) that, in the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda, I would “write my way out” of my struggles. I couldn't stop creating, even then. So I am writing my way out. This song is about battling my body, and is written for every one of my humans who has sat beside me in treatment centers and therapy groups and crying in hallways. I hope it resonates. (Yes, it's recorded in a car and with a sad, probably out-of-tune ukulele because we make do with what we have.)

I could never listen to songs about hope when I was at rock bottom. They felt bright and glittery and cheap. So I wrote a song that I could actually relate to, and I hope you find some resonance in there too. I've never quite been convinced by rainbows and sunshine words, so here's to what some friends have lovingly termed, “tenacious goddamn hope,” the kind that meets you in the trenches.

Reasons why I shop local:
- local businesses show the character of your community
- customer service is so much better 💛
- you as a customer matter more to them
- your money stays within the community 💵
- small businesses provide the most new jobs
- shopping local reduces your carbon footprint 👣

today in one of my classes, we talked about how when we travel, we are so eager to explore everything the city has to offer from museums to local food spots, but so many people have hardly explored their own.  if you're one of those people, i seriously urge you to go out and explore your city like you're a tourist who's never been there before. find your local artisans who have become masters of their craft whether that's in donut making, wood carving, or literally anything...the crazy amount of passion and talent in this world is incredible.  i promise that you'll be amazed with everything the place you call 'home' has to offer ✨

the other day, i had myself a little picnic. i brought along my favorite @bublywater flavor, picked up poké, and enjoyed my fizzy can-panion 😜and local food by the water with a view of the cleveland skyline less than a  minute walk away from my place.
 
my experience living in downtown cleveland has not been what i initially expected when i first signed my lease earlier this year before knowing what the rest of  had in store. nevertheless, i am so beyond grateful to be here and constantly getting to know this city in new ways.
 
cleveland may be cold, quiet, and a little grey these days, but i can bring my own color, and there's no other city i'd rather call home ♥️

Doc ID: 9424, distribution: 1.0 ; 'tis the season for cozying up and supporting local businesses ❤️✨🎄🎁

small businesses have gone through A LOT in the past couple of years, and while they deserve love and support year-round, they need your support extra during the holidays especially while we are still in the midst of the pandemic.

in partnership with @ohio.findithere, i've created a holiday gift guide on my blog (link in my stories) featuring all local cleveland businesses to help encourage you to shop small and local when gift buying this season if you can! however, there are so many other ways you can support local businesses including many that don't involve spending money as well.

here are some ways to support local businesses this season:

- leave a positive review
- buy a gift card for future use
- get holiday gifts from local businesses
- like, comment, and share their posts on social media
- order food from local restaurants
- check in with business owners and employees
