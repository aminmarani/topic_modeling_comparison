.
.
i understand some people have severe + extremely painful bloating, but that's not what i'm talking about here.  i'm talking about the bloating that happens after a meal, during that time of the month (me right now 🙃), and the morning after a fun meal out.  there have been so many days in my life where my mood was dictated by a slightly distended stomach, but minor bloating is normal!! so, can we please stop pathologizing it?  i remember internet searching ways to prevent any bloating and how to get rid of it fast if i planned on wearing a tight dress later that evening, but i'm realizing that all of that was just diet culture's way of making me hate my body and feel less than.  i'm not totally sure of where i'm going with this as i'm just kind of ranting at this point.  but, if you look a little bloated some mornings and most times after a meal, that usually just means that your body is normal.  sodium and carbs hold onto some water.  if your hormones are wack from your period or stress, that's gonna make you bloated too.  after you eat, your food needs to get digested
.
.
unfortunately, there probably isn't much we can do to change how companies and the media take advantage of our fear of bloating, but, we can demand to be better than that ourselves and to give a big ole' 🖕to diet culture

Doc ID: 10376.0, distribution: 0.8862272789799843 ; Fun fact about me: I eat some sort of dessert (the full fat and sugar kind, not a clean version of one) every. single. day.  Why? Because I like it, and it keeps me mentally sane.  BUT, I also eat plenty of “cleaner” foods throughout the day.  People used to look at my previous Instagram (when I didn't post any of the healthier things I eat) and assumed I only ate unhealthy and that I only looked fit because I was blessed with good genes.  I've also had other people in real life seeing me eat a lot of healthier things and make comments about how I probably don't actually eat the stuff that I post (btw, I will never post something I don't actually eat). Why do so many people think that being healthy or unhealthy is an all or nothing thing? It % isn't.  A healthy person can give themself a treat every day and still be considered healthy, and an unhealthy person can eat a salad every day, and still be in bad health.  I'm not telling you that you need to go eat a slice of cake every day to be have balance- everyone's body's needs and desires are completely different. But also, life is not an all or nothing experience. So, I encourage you to (as hard as it is) let go of all your food rules and restrictions and just live life in moderation because as I always preach, balance is everything!

consider these bites a tribute to my signature froyo sundae that i make every single time i go (vanilla frozen yogurt loaded with cookie dough pieces, brownie batter chunks, and peanut butter). 

recipe below for you guys— my DMs exploded after i teased these LOL

vegan chocolate covered cookie dough froyo bites

-  single serve (.oz) container of dairy-free vanilla yogurt (i used coconut)
- - tbsp creamy salted peanut butter
-  scoop plant based vanilla protein powder
- 
*optional: chocolate chips for mixing in

add all of the base ingredients to a bowl and mix until well combined. once you achieve the texture shown above, stir through chocolate chips. drop the frozen yogurt mixture onto a parchment paper lined plate and form into bites. freeze for an hour to set. remove from the freezer and coat in a melted chocolate mixture (i used / cup chocolate chips and  tbsp peanut butter melted in the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between).

Doc ID: 8698.0, distribution: 0.9249379061096398 ; trusting your intuition will CHANGE your life.

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right ones👁

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

❌our problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right path🌲no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

🙉you don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people… who would have known i “just” had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

🦋i have a few spots for : coaching in february 👀  so if you want to work with me this month to get clear on your purpose, drop your old ways, and build confidence in your direction, my application is in my bio and my DM box is always open🦋

but at the same time, it's easy to write off “i do eat” as “i do eat ENOUGH”

so i just invite you to get reallllyyyy honest and transparent with yourself about how much you're nourishing your body. it may be that there is something else going on, too. but if you've been having a gut feeling about your nourishment… let's lean into it

there are many situations in which we think we may be eating enough food but really aren't. 

you deserve to be energized to the fullest, with great bowel movements, and great sleep.

being properly and fully nourished is the foundation of you living your full purpose ❤️ you got this!

Doc ID: 584.0, distribution: 0.9546036080903586 ; I am still afraid of some foods because, even though i need to, i am afraid of gaining weight.
 
 Tw! Weight talk I am afraid of gaining weight because of various reasons, but mostly because it will be seen by my brain as lack of control, but i know i need to and i fight against this mentality daily because: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

 NOTHING  WRONG WITH GAINING WEIGHT, no problemo at all, but some days, like today, it feels like there is and i get nervous and anxious about a future body where i weight  kilos more.  Days like these are really draining honestly, there's a pit in my stomach because i feel bad with myself because i only ate junk food or a thing with “way to many calories” and i have to constantly remind myself that:
a) IT DOESN´T MATTER, i am fine, i need those foods, i like those foods, therefore i eat them. 
b) The thought “one won't hurt” “this thing won't make me gain x kilos” is completely dumb. What if that item of food did make me gain a whole ten kilos? What about it? What's so wrong with it? 

I write it with no problem but accepting it is very hard, today i did well, i ate against my ed, but when a day like today hits where the more i eat the more anxious and self conscious i feel, i tend to avoid certain foods which is NOT OKAY, OKAY ME? There was a time in my life where eating junk food was another walk in the park, i miss those days and i want them back, so i have to continue with positive reaffirmations that i am valid and fine even after i ate those high caloric foods. 

At the end of the day, today was just a bad day, with really big victories!, but a bad day still, and like i said in a previous post i can't get mad at myself because recovery isn't linear and i am allowed to not feel my best all of the time. These feelings of self consciousness after eating “bad” food won't go away today, but if i reassure myself tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that, maybe they will :)

 Do not trust Ana Tips Ever 
 Starvation mode does too fucking exist, your body will lower its metabolic rate, that's why you still lose a lot but gain lbs after one chip, YOU NEED TO VARY YOUR INTAKE  
 Diet soda and coffee are not a fucking cure all and if you live off of it, you can and will get kidney stones, YOU NEED TO DRINK WATER AND LIMIT DARK DRINKS TO  - A DAY  
 Apple cider vinegar should not be taken in fucking shots, do not try and chug it, it's a fucking vinegar, you will get burns down your throat and your stomach, it literally hurts worse than purgingand ruins your teeth faster, YOU NEED TO DILUTE IT IN SOMETHING 
 If you get dizzy or start passing out, your blood sugar and electrolytes are probably too low, DO NOT IGNORE THIS, DO NOT JUST LAY DOWN, DO NOT JUST DRINK A DIET SODA AND BRUSH IT OFF, you can fucking die from this, a girl I was in the hospital with had heart failure in the middle of therapy, YOU NEED SOME FAST ACTING CARB LIKE A JUICE OR FRUIT AND YOU NEED TO REPLINISH YOUR ELECTROLYTES 
 Do not ever fucking use a stimulant laxative!!!! Taking laxatives to lose weight is dumb we all know this, BUT I know none of us can shit anyway SO take an osmotic laxative!!! Unlike a stimulant laxative which is addictive and ruins your colon, osmotic laxatives just draw water into your colon to help ease the stool out! IT TAKES A FEW DAYS OF REGULAR DOSES TO WORK AND IT WILL ADD ON A LITTLE WATER WEIGHT BUT IT WILL HELP, THE WATER WEIGHT WILK GO AWAY  
 Do not ever fucking purge!!! It ruins your teeth and is a fucking addiction!!! You will burn through your esophagus, busy the blood vessels in your eyes, become dehydrated, cause migraines, and make your stomach so used to throwing up when you feel full that in recovery your body will automatically do it, DO NOT PURGE, IF YOU BINGE TAKE A DEEP BREATH, STAY AWAY FROM THE BATHROOM, AND DISTRACT YOURSELF  
 
 
Ana Tips can and have killed people and personally ruined my fucking life, don't listen to them, do your own research, do not believe these stupid ProAna accounts who “swear” by these tips 

ALSO A BIG FUCKING THING THAT IS NOT KNOWN OR AT LEAST I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT:
YOUR BRAIN NEEDS kcals A DAY TO FUNCTION. SO kcals ARE BURNED EVERY DAY SOLELY BY YOUR BRAIN. IF YOU STUDY OR DO ANYTHING THAT IS AS EXHAUSTING PLEASE INCREASE THE INTAKE BECAUSE THEN YOUR BRAIN NEEDS MORE. SO IF YOU EAT kcals A DAY AND YOU SUBTRACT  FOR YOUR BRAINPOWER YOU FUEL YOUR BODY WITH ONLY  WHICH IS FUCKING LOW.
DO NOT EVER GO BELOW !!!! I KNOW IT IS HARD. BUT YOUR BRAIN  N E E D S  IT OR ELSE IT WILL LITERALLY NOT WORK AND START TO SHUT DOWN. THAT IS WHY YOUR GRADES SLIP, WHY YOU CANNOT CONCENTRATE ANYMORE, ETC.

I weigh the exact same amount in both photos but my body looks different. That's because the ratio between fat & muscle has changed 💪🏼

On the left: I did only HIIT & cardio-based training! On the right: I do weightlifting & resistance training!

I still do a mix of both to this day, I'm not saying one is good and the other is bad! The great thing about exercise is that there's not just one type of movement you should do. Move your body in ANY way you enjoy! 😻 But as a female, I used to be scared to lift weights because I thought I'd get bulky & 'manly'... It really doesn't work that way!

🏋🏻‍♀️ Don't be afraid of lifting weights & strength training! Toning up is the act of gaining muscle. This is what gives your body definition. You will not get bulky overnight, gaining muscle takes time!! But this also depends on your genetic makeup. For some, gaining muscle comes more naturally. 

🏃🏻‍♀️ Walking is my FAV form of cardio. It's a passive & low-impact way to get your body moving, plus it's amazing for maintaining your overall health. That's why I always start my day with a light walk!

🍽 To gain muscle, you have to be eating ENOUGH & this usually means you have to eat in a SLIGHT calorie surplus. This gives your body that little bit of extra energy it needs to build muscle.

⏰ Give it time. I didn't notice my body changing very much as each day passed, but now that I look back I can definitely see the difference! Remember the paper towel analogy I posted last week!! 😉

🥪 Eat enough protein & carbs, they aren't bad! I prioritised my protein intake to ensure I was getting enough. I also didn't avoid carbs at all throughout my entire health & fitness journey. They're the body's preferred energy source! Enjoy them! 

😴 Rest & recover! This is where the magic happens. Your body is constantly working hard for you, so giving it that time to actually recover is vital! 🛌

Let's show other women (and men) they're not alone in feeling this way, but I hope videos & reminders like these will slowly chip away at the negative self-talk & encourage you to accept or eventually even embrace yourself like I have.

Confidence isn't a one-size-fits-all, be kind to yourself & to one another, because we've all been programmed to never feel good enough & to always want to be more 'this' or less 'that' 🥺

Our thoughts become our reality. If I continued picking myself apart & thinking there was something wrong with my cellulite / my thighs touching / my tummy bloating, my mind would constantly cherry pick all the things I don't like about my body and I'd NEVER be happy or comfortable in my skin. But once I started seeing more REAL bodies online, being kinder to myself & accepting my body as it is without all of the posing, sucking in & editing, I started feeling more confident overall. Feed your mind and body kinder, more forgiving thoughts & watch your life change. 

YOU are wonderful & you are enough, okay? GOOD, ILY 🥰

- chopped parsley

toss everything together and then add in the vegan lemon pesto. i just used a store bought vegan basil pesto and added in / cup lemon juice and a pinch of water to thin in order to achieve a runny, thin consistency. you can make your own pesto if you prefer! mix everything until uniform and serve cold :) this will last in the fridge for - days so feel free to make in large batches!

i no longer think of intentionally dieting as an option for myself (not saying people who diet are bad, but i know it doesn't work for me), i feel pretty neutral towards and accepting of my body, and i even feel confident in my body. yet, i still sometimes get this feeling that i'm doing something wrong by not having some sort of body-related goal and ask myself, “is it okay that i'm letting myself be?”

well, the answer to that question is yes, % YES, it's okay to let myself be, and it's pretty f-ed up that the messaging we constantly get told makes us feel wrong about accepting ourselves because dieting and constantly trying to “fix” and “better” ourselves is the norm.

some reminders for weight gain:

- allow yourself to grieve your smaller body. it's okay and doesn't make you a bad person to miss it, and it's normal especially given the world we love it.
- you don't have to love your body to take care of your body, shift your thoughts to neutral, and practice body acceptance.
- be gentle with yourself. shame is not an effective motivator, and you can't heal a body you hate. give yourself grace and compassion; you deserve nothing less.
- bodies change and fluctuate. meet yourself where you're at, not where you once were or where you think you want to be. fighting with your reality will cause unnecessary pain.
- diet culture is rampant, and the diet industry's goal is to make money off of your insecurities by spreading harmful messaging and upholding systems of oppression. while it's nearly impossible to fully opt of diet culture, it is possible to tune it out.
- healing isn't about fixing yourself or becoming more worthy, but rather correcting the misconception that you are an error that needs to be fixed in the first place.

i decided on being vegan in , and this upcoming january will be  years of cruelty free meals

it started out as an experiment because i thought it was absolutely nuts to be eating  bananas a day (if you know you know) but it felt SO good to have:

-more energy in my brain & muscles
-cleaner and more consistent bowel movements
-colorful and hydrating meals

at the same time i took a deep dive into learning about the impact of the animal industry. knowing that every meal i eat/buy has an influence on the environment, my health, and my morals/values made going vegan a no-brainer. i couldn't go back to eating meat after my little experiment. 

the way i eat now has changed so much from then (less raw & more filling and warm/cooked meals) but it still holds the same value: no animals intentionally harmed in the making

i feel so grateful for the way vegan food has evolved over the years. we still have a ways to go with making this way of living/eating normal and accessible… but if you are interested in trying it out, just do what you can with what you have! 

i would say to not judge yourself, read up on the lifestyle and find answers to your doubts & questions. the internet is full of info that is verified by health professionals!

and if going fully vegan isn't in the cards for you in this lifetime, your body would still appreciate you doing what you can ❤️ 🫶🏽

I have always said that my appearance is the least interesting thing about me, and that goes for all of us. Please remember: what people say about you is a reflection of THEM! What matters most is your heart... Be kind & courteous to others, follow your heart and do what makes you happy 💛⠀
⠀
Recently, so many strangers have been assuming that because I'm thin, I must be unhealthy or that I lost weight in an unhealthy way... I know I shouldn't give the negativity my time, but I feel the need to address my most frequent hate-comments just once:⠀
⭐️ “She looks sick” — I haven't been sick in almost  years and I believe that's thanks to my healthy lifestyle boosting my immune system 😇⠀
⭐️ “Anorexic” — anorexia is an eating disorder, it's characterised by food restriction, fear of gaining weight & so on, which is very serious. If this is your concern, reach out to me personally, but public comments like this isn't the way to go. I love food, I eat more than the recommended daily intake for men and women & I recently chose to gain back almost  kilos to better my health, I'm not afraid of gaining weight.⠀
⭐️ “Eat a burger” — I prefer to eat nutritious foods and save my $$$, so while I don't get takeaway often, I'll HAPPILY make burgers at home on the daily.⠀
⭐️ “Bad role model” — I'm just trying to be the role model I needed growing up. Posting photos of my rolls, bloating, etc helps me step out of my comfort zone, to not hide my flaws and not always portray the very best version of myself online. I'm all about self-love, body confidence and overall health. I'm happy with who I am and what I put out there, so if this is how you view my journey then I'm okay with that.⠀
⭐️ “Way too thin” + “so unhealthy” — if you still feel this way after learning more about my story, then I refuse to give your opinion anymore of my time than I already have 😋⠀

Doc ID: 2637.0, distribution: 0.8773345238298722 ; MORNING VS EVENING... Just a few hours apart! 😅 Do you know why your body always looks different by the end of the day???

You haven't:
suddenly gained weight ❌
eaten too much ❌
made bad food choices ❌
not exercised enough ❌
done SOMETHING wrong ❌

The truth???
If you step on the scale several times throughout the day, you'll never see the same number. That's because so many factors contribute to the way your body changes throughout the day: food, drinks, hormones, exercise or lack of, medication, salt, state of hydration & so on.

Out of curiosity, I documented my body's changes today and this is what happened:

🕓 When I first woke up, my tummy looked 'deflated', that's because my body had plenty of time overnight to digest & break down the food in my tummy. Also, we often become dehydrated after many hours without food & drink which makes our tummies appear slimmer.

🕖 My weight increased after every meal & snack! But remember, this is only temporary! 

🕢 My weight dropped slightly after I went for a walk due to the fluid loss (sweat) but just like the weight gain you see & feel after eating, it's not permanent. I didn't *actually* lose weight all of a sudden from that walk. Once I rehydrated, it went back up again. 

🕦 By the end of the day, I was almost kgs heavier than I was at the start of the day!

It's common for the average body to fluctuate in weight by -kgs over the course of a single day. However, it doesn't reflect an increase in body fat. So next time you're feeling down about your bloating & body changes, remember that your body is working hard & doing everything it needs to 🥰

(Please note that some bloating can be a cause for concern, so if it causes you pain & discomfort, in that situation you may need to consult a doctor 💛)

Doc ID: 2533.0, distribution: 0.8678851764274502 ; Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us ✨

 years ago, I was a hermit, I lost my closest friend, was struggling with low self esteem, didn't have a job, licence or any direction in my life. I spent all of my time in my room & didn't go out anywhere or see anyone because I thought I had no other choice. 

“Who would I see? Where would I go? I can't go out on my own. That's embarrassing” 

What I've learned over the years is that being alone doesn't have to be lonely.

If I want to go on a hike, have a picnic, see a movie, go to a themepark or fly interstate, I can do that! I don't need to rely on anyone else. If I want to laugh, sing, order whatever I want from the menu, I can do all of that in my own company too 🎢 

Even now that I'm in a relationship & have amazing friends in my life, I think it's very healthy to spend time alone. It's something I treasure & make time for now every week (when I can), because it's given me a sense of freedom & confidence within myself that I'd never had before.

If you never go, you'll never know 🌻 

Where would you take yourself on a solo date? I'd love to hear them! 🥰

It's still crazy to me to think that just - years ago I discovered Macro Mike & became a regular customer for a good year before I started sharing them on my story when I had about , followers. They reached out to me at that point to start working together & have believed in me ever since. So proud to be growing with this team, to have our own range (with more in the pipelines) & to be a Macro Mike Brand Hero 🦸‍♀️💛

The reason we created this range is because we wanted to offer anyone with a sweet tooth (AKA me) a healthier, more balanced dessert alternative. We created something that could be made easily (all you need is your choice of milk + a mug + a spoon) in travel sachets so you can take them with you to work, or to a friends' house, or on the road for a single serve chocolate-y mug cake (with melted choc chip pieces) within  seconds! Aaaaand I think we crushed it 🤭😍

My code: AMB-BREE will give you % off + enjoy free international shipping on orders over $!! Highly recommend stocking up & saving money on shipping since the shelf life lasts so long for all of their gluten free, vegan, all natural, high protein, macro balanced goodies!!

I wanted my first “Real Me Monday” series of  to be less focused on body image this time & more focused on the bigger picture… Because as humans, we tend to compare ALL aspects of our lives to others all. the. time 🙄😅 

This post is a prime example of why you're doing yourself a HUUUGE disservice by doing that.

Perfection doesn't exist. The posts we see online are normally the inspirational, aesthetically pleasing things like the fancy, healthy lunch someone ordered, or the clear skin they woke up with, or the new manicure they got, all the friends they hang out with or the posed & filtered pictures, but that's not necessarily what their lifestyle looks like at all times. It's just what they feel comfortable & inspired to share, which is perfectly okay too 🫶

What you don't see all over the internet are the less appealing/uninspiring/quick meals, dirty dishes in the sink, the skin breakouts, the month old manicure that is peeling off, faded & cracked, the way they overthink everything they said when they hang out with people, or the relaxed, bloated and/or messy version of them (that we all experience), the list goes on!! 

Don't compare your everyday life to someone else's. When we constantly put our wins up against others' wins, it can make us feel like we have no wins to celebrate at all. You're doing your best… Go you!!! This is your sign to schedule in a time this week to do something for YOU to celebrate yourself & your own wins, no matter how big or small.

We've been taught to pick ourselves apart from a young age… But the good news is that something you've learned is something you can unlearn too. 
We live in a society where we're made to believe that our appearance defines who we are, with impossible standards on our TVs, social media, movie screens, magazines, etc. It's been said that we see at least  media images per day. That's at least  opportunities in a day to compare yourself & not feel good enough. 
This is scary since the messages you consume become you. The beauty standards you see & put yourself around - whether online or in the real world - are the expectations you normalise for yourself. This is why it's so important to fill your social media feed with diverse & REAL people who leave you feeling better, instead of worse!

I no longer opt in to consuming only filtered, airbrushed, perfected, edited & posed highlight reels. 

The  images I consume now are from people doing their best & showing up as THEMSELVES… with cellulite, rolls, body hair, mental/physical illness, love handles, stretch marks, body fat, uneven b👀bs, scars, moles, visible veins (the list goes on). All of which are very real human things that a lot of us experience. It's made me more accepting of myself AND of others. While I don't always relate to every post I see on my social media feed, I also no longer have this unrealistic, unhealthy expectation for my body or life.

Now I feel kinder & more thankful for my body for what it does for me, rather than the way it looks. Trust me, it DOES make a difference! Leave a “🎄" below if you're with me!! Happy Real Me Monday! 🫶

“Too big, too skinny, too short, too tall, too outspoken, too quiet, trying too hard” — there's this feeling that we're all 'too' something while at the same time not good enough.

And it's crippling. But guess what? Telling your brain all of these things is only adding fuel to the fire. If you're filling your mind with these thoughts, it's no wonder it's all you see when you take a glance at your own reflection. As I've mentioned before, your brain looks for all the things you've told it in order to confirm & validate how you're feeling. So when you start speaking positively to yourself, slowly in time, that's what you'll start to seek & find.

So I'm just leaving this series of posed VS unposed photos here each Monday to remind you not to compare YOUR real to someone else's Instagram highlight reel. A lot of what you see online is the photos on the left, but what I see is the version on the right because that's what my body looks like % of the time when I relax & just let my body be free. I used to struggle to even look at the unposed, unedited, natural, normal version of me… But now I appreciate & embrace all versions of me. THAT'S the version of yourself that you deserve to feel comfortable in too.

You can either view yourself through a negative lens or consciously start choosing to view yourself through a positive one — easier said than done, of course — but which lens are you going to start choosing? Let me know in the comments for accountability!!! Leave a “➖” for negative & a “➕” for positive! Put it out there 🙌🏼

only look good if they suck their tummy in tight & hide their “flaws”

need to change themselves 

“can't wear that” or “can't eat that”

are too loud

too “weird”

gross

a mess

pathetic

unloveable

or that the squishy parts of them are disgusting? 

I know I sure wouldn't. I'd lift my younger self up, encourage her, cheer her on & build up her confidence. Just like we should be doing to ourselves RIGHT NOW.

Pretty is not the only (or most important) thing a person can be. You can be pretty smart, pretty kind, pretty strong, pretty inspiring, the list goes on.

You will never spend more time with anyone other than yourself.

That can either be empowering… or defeating.

Which one are you going to choose? 

Believe it or not, it IS up to you. You won't reach confidence, self acceptance, body neutrality or self love overnight, it takes time to rewire your mindset & unlearn all of these beliefs you've carried over the years. 

But you WILL reach it eventually, if you don't give up on yourself, because you ARE already good enough. With every act of grace towards yourself, you're one step closer. One day of self-kindness at a time. 

We've got this! Happy Real Me Monday, just done a lil differently this week 🤝🥹💐

It never occurred to me that after having the vaccine I could do any other things… I don't know if that's just me being dumb.  Probably it's partly me because I know I'm quite black and white about things, and I just follow the rules, vaccine or no vaccine. So as and when UK lockdown relaxes, I'll go with that.

Doc ID: 6877.0, distribution: 0.9829513148078605 ; if you know me, you know i have an easy, no-bake treat on hand at all times. my peanut butter cookie dough protein bars are a crowd favorite, so i decided to remix them by swapping the protein powder for a delicious crunch! these new peanut butter bars get their crunch from @lundbergfarms Organic Lightly Salted Rice Cakes. Lundberg has been popping rice cakes since the s— they use freshly milled, whole grain brown rice from their California farms. you can purchase your own here: shop.lundberg.com. i'm so happy with how these turned out and don't think they'll last long in my house! recipe below for you.

okay wait no i have more to say 🙂 no bake treats are my favorite, and i really think this recipe makes my top  for that category 😛 not only is the texture perfect, the flavor will transcend you straight to your thanksgiving dinner table (which is where i want to be at all times tbh). i experimented with the frosting on these (its not white chocolate!) and now it's my new to go for all things no bake…find out what i did below ⬇️

no-bake high protein pumpkin spice cookie dough bites

- / cup nut butter of choice (i used cashew)
-  tbsp coconut sugar
-  tbsp maple syrup
- / cup pumpkin purée 
-  cup oat flour
- pinch of sea salt
- cinnamon
- pumpkin pie spice

mix the nut butter, coconut sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin purée together until smooth. add the flour and spices and mix until well-combined (may have to use your hands here until a dough forms). roll into balls and freeze for about an hour or until firm. topping is just two scoops of vanilla protein powder mixed with almond milk until desired consistency (mine was a bit thick but still runny) and chopped nuts. place back in the freezer to set! i like these best thawed for a minutes when they're soft!
