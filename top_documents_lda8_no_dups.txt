these fears can be SOOOO debilitating and can stop you from actually going for what you want, and BEING who you want to be.

when i peeled back the layers of each fear-based belief, i realized that they all stemmed from a common-thread belief that honestly sounded so illogical.

when i realized what it was and did the work to rewrite those beliefs, 

i was FREE.

❌“my parents are going to be so disappointed in me”

became➡️

✅“my parents love me unconditionally, and their reaction to my passion/path is not my responsibility. my decision to choose what i want over what they want is independent of my love and respect for them.”

❌“its too late to change my path, there's not enough time”

became➡️ 

✅“i don't operate on any one timeline. i can create what i want whenever i want. this is the game of life.”

❌“i might make the wrong choice and regret it”

became➡️ 

✅ “every choice i make leads me to a more compassionate & aware version of myself. the more i practice making choices, the better i get at discerning which will be best for me.”

❌“im not skilled/smart/capable enough to do it.”

became➡️ 

✅”I can do anything i set my mind to. what matters more than my SKILL is how much i ENJOY the process.”

❌“i will lose friends and connections in my community

became➡️ 

✅”i do not need to be understood. I have value to share. my ideal community is full of people who want to hear my message.”

✨finding your purpose is only one part of the equation…. we have to let go of those fears to make room for the life we dream about.

Doc ID: 8873, distribution: 0.9970359595827156 ; advice/tips on handling being down/overwhlemed from the pandemic?

this was something a story-watcher asked me to talk about this week

to be honest with you, i don't have a SOLID answer for you. this is mostly because i don't know what you've gone through and i don't know how your mind works exactly

but here are a few things i would like to share with anyone feeling down or overwhelmed by all of this: 

you are OKAY and it is OKAY

you didn't get into that workout routine you thought you'd get into this summer? that's OKAY

you didn't get the grade you thought you would get on the online class you took? you had to withdraw because taking classes online for the past  months hasn't been easy? that's OKAY

you feel anxious/nervous thinking about going outside and getting back into a social scene? that's OKAY

you feel side tracked with your goals and unsure of life? that's OKAY

i don't know what you are going through right now, but i can tell you that what you went/are going through was/is not easy. and it's important to give yourself grace when you need to, as well as tough love when it feels right

i hope that i can remind you that it's OKAY to take your time getting comfortable with whatever you set out to do. it's OKAY to keep saying no until you feel ready to say yes. 

of course, there is a line between being complacent and being protective of your energy/health. when making a decision, try to be honest with yourself and ask yourself what ~feels~ right to you. you'll often be led to the best answer.

the BEST thing you can do for others in this world is to work on yourself. this includes being patient, loving, and protective towards yourself as well. if i don't cleanse and love that space within me, how can i possibly provide a safe space for others? care for others, but remember you are a human who deserves that care too.

last but not least, you're not alone. you matter. you are important. you deserve to be here and as happy as all the people you love in your life. 

that is all. thanks for reading the (mostly unrelated) caption under this picture of me and @kiaralovepup 🥰 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 8698, distribution: 0.9969617321238154 ; trusting your intuition will CHANGE your life.

& to clarify: my intuition has never led me down the wrong path. therefore, no actual notes or list on this one.

all the right decisions i've ever made in my life were not made with my MIND. i just KNEW in my body they were the right ones👁

and often times, you know when it's right for you, too.

❌our problems come along when we get into our heads and think about:

-what others will think
-how my community will receive my choice
-whether or not it will be the BEST
-if it's the most efficient
-if it makes total logical sense
-what i will lose when i choose that thing

these thoughts cloud what our intuition has already deemed the best path for us, and can take us for a little detour.

the great thing about life, though, is that you will always end up on the right path🌲no matter what you choose. it just takes a bit longer than if you just trusted that deep inner voice in your body.

🙉you don't HAVE to listen to your intuition (read: you actually don't have to listen to anything/one), but it's the most trustworthy and reliable source for you to make decisions with your best interest in mind. 

it's taken me a lot of practice (and still is!!!) to finally listen and trust my intuition and learn to distinguish between intuition vs. fear.

this practice has led me to so many amazing experiences, opportunities, and people… who would have known i “just” had to trust?

they don't teach you this in school, college, or even training for your new job. that's why i share what i know with you, and guide my clients to do the same.

🦋i have a few spots for : coaching in february 👀  so if you want to work with me this month to get clear on your purpose, drop your old ways, and build confidence in your direction, my application is in my bio and my DM box is always open🦋

if you made it this far, what do you think about following & listening to your intuition? what questions do you have about it? drop them down below ⬇️🥰

Doc ID: 9506, distribution: 0.9968431481692119 ; not enough people talk about it, but being in your early 's is HARD.

growing up, i always dreamed of the early years post-college. we get told our early 's are “the best years of our lives”, and i fantasized about the new sense of freedom i'd have thinking i'd be working my dream job and having fun, going out, and being happy all the time.

don't get me wrong, i am very grateful for this life of mine and feel so blessed for the people in my life, the job i have, and the situation i'm in, but what i never realized was that being in this in between stage between being in school and having an established career and between being a kid and being an adult often feels frustrating, conflicting, and confusing as heck.

i've spent a lot of days the past few months feeling lost in life, anxious about not knowing my purpose, and terrified of the future because i have no idea what i plan on doing or where my path will lead me. but, on the days my mind is a little quieter, i'm able to reassure myself that

i don't need to have all the answers,
there's still so much time for me to become all that i'm meant to be,
what is meant for me will not pass me,
i do not need to prove my worth,
my best is always enough,
i deserve to give myself a break,
and there is so much peace to be found in the unknown.

sometimes, especially with social media and seeing people's highlight reels, it can feel isolating to feel this way, but talking to blake and some friends from school, i realize that these feelings are ones that a lot of us are feeling, and it brings me comfort knowing that i'm not the only one. so, to my fellow -something year olds:

you are not alone, and we will be okay.

disclaimer: i know not everyone follows the traditional life timeline, and there is no right or wrong way to go through life. it's okay and normal not to have it all together no matter what your age is or where you are in life. sending love to all beings.

Doc ID: 7141, distribution: 0.9968224783280916 ; these pictures are taken one year apart. aside from the fact that i'm still living in sweatshirts (🤠) a lot has changed.

when i posted the second photo last year, everything was unknown. i left school thinking i'd be home for a week or two. i had no idea how heavy the world would become for months, for a year. i had no idea that that my life as i knew it and the plans i had for the future would both be flipped upside down.

i remember taking that photo and feeling afraid. and i still am, afraid, sometimes. but hardship makes us stronger. i took the first photo today and felt changed. refreshed. like i've let go of so much.

this past year i've:

- finally closed doors on experiences that no longer serve me
- leaned deeply into relationships, and accepted that the need to be supported is not a weakness but a strength
- taken control over my own narrative, and chosen to see rejection as redirection
- worked on feeling secure in my person, my skin, and my beliefs

time heals. it really does. i think back to this time last year- i don't have everything figured out now, but i have found peace in places where i never thought possible. i'll always have work to do. we're always healing. change doesn't always have to be obvious or out loud. 

these pictures look similar but are deeply different. the internal work is the hardest. it's also the most rewarding. this year has been tough but i've found room to grow.  i'm proud of that. i have ways to go but ive also come far. 

i'm excited to meet the person i'll be next year, and the next, and the next 🦋🦋 taking a few minutes to reflect like this every so often is so healing for me 🙏

i'm a firm believer in things falling into place, things happening for a reason. always investing my trust in the universe or some higher power, whatever that may be.
.
.
but this doesn't mean i'm not intimidated by whichever next steps i inevitably face. .
.
i have so many passions and ideas and projects i want to pursue but worry i'm not moving quickly enough. i have so many roles i see myself excelling at but worry i'm not qualified enough. i worry about my resume. i worry about my gpa. i worry about my job performance and spending habits and my ability to plan for the future when living in the moment has been such a healing mindset for me this past year.
.
.
wherever i'm meant to be after graduation, i know i'll find my way. i don't expect things to work out instantly. i've always been late when it comes to these kinds of things. i spent six years of my life sick and alone before i started to live fully. six whole years behind my peers. but i got there.
.
.
when i get down on myself in moments like this i try to build myself back up. i know i'm resilient and can navigate hardship. i know i'm passionate and fully invested in creating something from nothing. i know i'm capable and dedicated. these are hard things for me to say. they feel selfish, obnoxious. .
.
i'm working on being more comfortable supporting myself. there should be no shame in recognizing our own strengths. for all the worry that hangs over me over the next few months, knowing i have a strong head on my shoulders helps me move forward.
.
.
even if i'm not quite sure what i'm walking into just yet. all in good time.

Doc ID: 9454, distribution: 0.9964764120208653 ; last week, i unexpectedly lost one of the most important and present people in my life, my 外公.

my grandpa moved to america a couple days before i was born and was here for me as a constant source of love, strength, and joy for over  years. having lived in cleveland my whole life at this point, i feel so fortunate to have been able to spend a lot of time with family. while i feel very grateful to have gotten more time than many people do with my grandpa, there's so many activities, celebrations, milestones that just won't be the same without his presence.

the hardest part of experiencing grief the past few days has been facing a lot of feelings of guilt and regrets for all the things i could've said or could've done to show my grandpa i love him and make the most of my time with him.  i can only hope that he knew that i cared about him and appreciated all his small efforts and try my best to move forward, to remember how precious life is with every human interaction, and to give myself and others grace. i share this because grief is hard and uncomfortable to feel and to talk about, but it's also very real and something all of us experience at some point in our lives.

no matter what pain or hardships you are going through, it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to take time to feel your feelings, it's okay to do what you need to do for yourself. the rest of the world can wait.

i hope my grandpa rests easy, and his legacy lives on through many cherished memories and the strength he instilled in all the lives he touched. i love you, grandpa. you will forever be missed.

Doc ID: 9525, distribution: 0.9964764120208653 ; if you look at this picture of me from this weekend visiting nyc, spending time outside, and thoroughly enjoying my ice cream, you aren't able to judge my emotional state or greater mental health picture, nor should you. 

when i'm going through a depressive episode, I don't lay in bed all day every single day, crying, trying to escape reality through netflix or sad music, and incapable of doing my daily functions. 

some days do look like that, but most days, i can get ready in the morning, i keep working, i interact with others, i smile and laugh, i do enjoyable things, i dance to music, and above all, i experience times of happiness.

one of the most irritating myths about depression to me is that all depressed people are sad all of the time and therefore, people who feel happiness can't be  experiencing depression even if they say they are. it's one look of depression that further stigmatizes the illness and causes many who are struggling with depression to feel trapped between engaging in the sadness and darkening everything around them in order to appear depressed to others and get recognition for it and putting on a face and performing the opposite because sad depressed people are “no fun”.

depression isn't an all or nothing deal, and it manifests itself differently in every individual and at different times.

i've been struggling a lot with my depression lately and have been having a hard time knowing what to say or do about it especially because to many, i don't “seem” like i'm doing that bad.  a reminder for me and maybe for some of you: you don't need to prove yourself to anyone. you only need from validation from one person, and that person is you. 
------------------------------------------------------------
Doc ID: 9578, distribution: 0.9960132673950135 ; last night i caught myself starting to go down the comparison trap.

even though the self-doubting thoughts only lasted a couple minutes before i was able to cut them off and distract myself, here are just some of the thoughts that were going through my head:

why doesn't my instagram page look as ~aesthetic~ as others? why don't i have anything more inspiring or insightful to share? how does it seem so effortless for them? should i be connecting with more people? do people even care about my online presence? what do people think of me? are they judging me? do they think i'm boring? what am i even doing on here? do i belong?

most days on this platform, i do me, i appreciate and admire others, and i don't feel like i should be doing anything differently because at the end of the day, this page reflects ME, and as long i'm staying true to myself, then i feel pretty good about having this outlet. but, i'm not immune to the gratification that comes from likes, growth, engagement, and every now and then i question myself, what i'm doing, and the timing of it all.

we compare our personal lives to situations, people, and things we consider “ideal” and forget to recognize that not every ideal we are subjected to is applicable for ourselves. when's the last time you appreciated yourself, recognized your strengths, and celebrated all the different qualities that make you YOU?

ending this caption with a mantra for myself and anyone else who might need to here it:

you are not behind. being behind means there's someone on your path ahead of you, but no one is on your path except for you. breathe deep, remember who you are, and stay true to yourself. you are exactly where you need to be.

Doc ID: 8718, distribution: 0.9960132673950135 ; of all the fears i had in changing my direction, the fear of other peoples reactions was the biggest block 

in my people pleasing past, i learned how to control the reactions of other people so that i could be in their favor by doing what ~i thought~ would make them happy

(hint: if you consider yourself highly sensitive & empathetic, there's a high chance you're good at this too)

but at a certain point, my want to make people happy and keep them comfortable with the current version of myself  was getting in the way of my own happiness

i had to do something different to get something different

i had to change the way i thought about the world 

and the truth is, when anyone i knew ever pivoted their career or direction, i thought about it for . seconds… and moved on with my life. 

“oh good for them!!” *back to my daily routine*

my . second consideration actually didn't mean anything to my life, 

so why would it mean anything to others? 

in the most loving way i can say this- people don't care like you think they do. 

do the thing, make the jump, hire the person, make the change 

your best and highest version is waiting for you 😇🦋

this dressing is only TWO ingredients and one of them is water! probably my favorite cooking/kitchen hack of all time. i like serving this bowl warm for a cozy vibe but you can definitley make a large batch of it at the beginning of the week to enjoy each day straight from the fridge. super versatile :) i also love adding tofu when i have it handy!

warm harvest quinoa bowl

ingredients:

*makes two servings

- kale (i used one huge bag, thinking it's about  or  cups)
- cooked quinoa 
- roasted butternut squash, cubed (i'd say about  cup worth) (i roasted mine tossed with olive oil and sea salt in the oven at F for  min)
- craisins
- pumpkin seeds
- / cup vegan feta cheese

garlic hummus dressing:

whisk the following until creamy (adjust water amount based on your desired consistency)

- / cup garlic hummus (if using classic hummus, add some garlic powder for flavor)
-  tbsp water    
start by massaging the kale base. to a large serving bowl, add the kale and coat in a very generous few pours of olive oil and lemon juice. add salt and garlic powder, then massage with your hands for about - minutes, really making sure to break down the leaves (this makes them less bitter and significantly easier to digest). once the kale is massaged, toss in the remaining mix-ins, along with more sea salt and garlic powder if desired. set aside and whisk together the dressing ingredients until smooth and uniform. pour the dressing over top, toss everything very well using salad tongs, and enjoy! i store this in the fridge for up to a week.

note that it can be served hot or cold. i love it cold for lunch and for dinner, i've been reheating it on the stovetop and stirring in some precooked quinoa for extra nourishment!

i love prepping my grain bowls in batches at the beginning of the week since i crave them every day! my formula for my bowls is simple: a base of greens (i love massaged kale or plain arugula), a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa for me), roasted veggies (been loving sweet potato chunks lately but brussel sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, or zucchini are staples of mine), a crunch factor (crispy chickpeas here, but can do nuts or seeds), and a creamy, flavorful dressing (the one i used here reigns supreme).

prep and dressing details below! hope this bowl inspires some nourishing eats for you this week :)

 minute vegan taco bowl:

ingredients:

 - microwavable brown rice cup 
 - massaged kale
 - sautéed peppers and onions
 - pinto beans
 - cashew cream
 - avocado 

directions:

 - prep the kale, peppers/onions, and cashew cream ahead of time. 
 - kale: i massaged the kale by hand in olive oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and nutritional yeast until softened (about  minutes). i find this lasts in the fridge for the week!
 - peppers/onions: slice  bell peppers and  onion and add to a stovetop pan with olive oil and taco seasoning. cook until softened and fragrant (about  minutes). store in a tupperware container in the fridge!
 - cashew cream: soak / cup of raw cashews in boiling water for about a half hour. then drain and add to a blender with  cup water, / cup nutritional yeast,  tbsp dijon mustard,  tbsp olive oil,  tbsp lemon juice, sea salt, and garlic powder. blend until smooth and store in a glass jar in the fridge.

to assemble:

 - cook the rice according to package directions (i love minute cups because they're quick with minimal clean up). add the kale to a bowl, then the rice, then the peppers/onions mix. for the beans i just use canned pinto beans (pre-cooked). rinse and drain and add to the bowl! add fresh mashed avocado and finish with a hefty pour of cashew cream.

i absolutely love burrito bowls and this one has been on repeat since last week. i love making my own at home because i get to play around with the flavors and spices, plus i can make enough to last me for multiple meals throughout the week. this bowl is great with white or brown rice (i'm just going through a quinoa obsession right now hahaha). the star of the bowl really is that super easy vegan cashew sour cream— simple, nourishing, and flavorful. i suggest making a large batch and using it on salads/bowls throughout the week!

- cup diced carrots
-/ cup red lentils (rinsed and drained)
- cup tomato puree
- cups coconut milk
- tbsp tomato paste
- tbsp red curry paste
-curry powder, sea salt, cumin

sauté the onion in oil, sea salt, curry powder, cumin, curry paste, and tomato paste until soft and fragrant. add the carrots and cook a few more minutes until tender. once the carrots are soft add in the remaining ingredients and cook on medium heat until you notice the lentils starting to soften and some of liquid be absorbed. here's the **trick** to thick: transfer half of the mix into a blender and puree until smooth, then add back to the pot (this is the secret to getting it extra creamy)! cook partially covered on medium heat for about - minutes with frequent stirring. .

Doc ID: 6803, distribution: 0.9967956249412351 ; these brownies were *supposed* to make it to the thanksgiving table but i literally ate the whole batch the night before WHOOPS. they're that good 😏

this recipe is wild hahaha. the first layer is a rich, fudgy, cookie dough-like brownie bite. the middle is a decadent and perfectly sweet and salty mix of caramel pecan pie. and the third, in signature healthful fashion, is a hearty coating of thick chocolate. there's really nothing you won't love about these. did i mention the recipe comes together in under  minutes and there's no baking required? 

say less…

double fudge no-bake caramel pecan pie brownies

base layer:

- / cup creamy tahini
-  tbsp melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
- / cup cacao powder

directions:

 add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and combine until a uniform, moldable dough forms. transfer this to a brownie tin or a parchment paper lined tupperware and press flat to desired thickness (i made these bars pretty thick so i didn't spread the base layer too much)! place in the fridge to set for a few minutes while you prepare the middle layer.

caramel pecan pie layer:

- - soft pitted dates
-  tbsp creamy tahini
- / cup raw pecans, finely chopped 

add the dates and tahini to a food process or blender and blend until a thick, sticky paste forms. this took about  minutes for me. at this point stir through the pecans until fully coated. transfer this layer to the base layer and spread evenly.

chocolate topping:

-  cup chocolate chips of choice
-  tbsp creamy tahini

melted the chocolate and tahini until smooth. pro-tip: i've been melting chocolate with tahini instead of coconut oil and it's a GAME CHANGER. so much thicker and easier to bite into later! i melted mine  seconds in the microwave, stirred, and then another  seconds. pour this layer over the top and place in the fridge to set for at least an hour. slice and enjoy!

▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️▪️
super fudgey vegan cream cheese swirl brownies

set the oven to  and grease a brownie pan (can use a small loaf pan, that's what i did to get this bar shape)! 

in a small bowl, make a flax egg by mixing together  tbsp ground flax and . tbsp water. let sit until thick.

in a serparate bowl mix:
-  cup plus / cup almond flour
- / cup cacao powder
- pinch of baking powder
- sprinkle of cinnamon
- pinch of sea salt

in a microwave safe bowl, add one chopped up chocolate bar (i used @joyalife coconut milk bar) and  tbsp coconut oil. microwave for  seconds, then remove and mix thoroughly until melted. 

to the flax egg, add:
- / cup olive oil
- the melted chocolate bar

pour wet ingredients into the dry mixture and stir until a thick batter forms. if too thick, add up to  tbsp non-dairy milk until a smooth, rich batter forms (but not runny)! pour batter in the brownie pan.

in a microwave safe bowl, add  tbsp vegan cream cheese and  tbsp maple syrup. microwave for  seconds, then remove and mix thoroughly, scoop cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter, then swirl in using a toothpick. can swirl some through the batter before you pour it into the pan as well! bake for  minutes and let cool completely before serving!

details for these vegan twix bars below! the date caramel recipe alone makes this post worth saving… you'll want to eat it by the spoonful.

vegan twix bars

crust:

- / cup oats
-  cup soaked raw cashews (i did / cashews and / dry roasted peanuts)
-  tbsp melted and cooled coconut oil 
-  tbsp maple syrup 

date caramel layer: 
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter (can also use creamy salted almond butter)
-  tbsp maple syrup 
- - medium soft dates, pitted
- splash of vanilla
- sea salt
- cinnamon

chocolate layer: 
-  chocolate bar of choice, chopped
-  tbsp peanut butter 

directions:

add all of the crust ingredients in a blender and blender until uniform. transger to a brownie pan (i used a small tupperware) and form into a solid layer. place in the fridge to set for five minutes. while that's setting, make the date caramel layer by adding all of those ingredients to the blender (rinsed after making the crust) and blend until smooth/uniform. you may need to add more water in  tbsp increments to get the blender moving, especially if it's not a super high power one! transfer the caramel onto the crust layer and place back in the fridge to set for a few minutes. melt the chocolate and peanut butter (i use the microwave in two  second increments, stirring in between). once smooth, pour over the caramel, spread evenly, and place in the fridge for set for at least  hours. remove, let thaw for a few minutes, slice, and store in the fridge!

Doc ID: 6715, distribution: 0.9962435255624305 ; probably one of the most decadent and dreamy desserts i've shared to date… pun intended 😗

FOUR ingredients… you're kidding. 

i promise you'll save this so fast hahaha. you must make ASAP. details below!

-ingredient chocolate stuffed brownie cups

brownie base:

- - medium soft pitted dates, soaked in boiling water for a half hour to soften (optional, but ideal)
- / cup cacao powder
-  tbsp creamy salted peanut butter  
add these three ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend until a dough ball forms. you should be able to roll the dough out in your hands without it breaking. if it's too loose you may need to add a tbsp or two of water to thicken.

split the dough into balls and form a cup shape, making sure the center is deep and the edges are high. place these on a parchment paper lined plate and place in the freezer to set (about  min)

while the brownie cups are setting, make the chocolate filling:

- - medium soft pitted dates
-  cup chocolate chips/chopped chocolate of choice
-  tbsp hot water  
blend in the blender until smooth and silky. i left mine on the thicker side, transferred to a bowl, and whisk in another  tbsp of water (slowly) to smooth it out and make it a bit runnier. place the chocolate filling in the fridge to thicken up a bite while the brownie cups are still setting.

remove the cups from the freezer, dollop chocolate filling into each, and place back in the freezer to set. when you're ready to eat, let them slightly thaw for a few minutes or microwave for  seconds (so good this way). this recipe made  cups for me!

jumbo salted almond butter stuffed chocolate cups

chocolate layer: 
-  cup chocolate chips 
-  tbsp coconut oil
  salted almond butter filling:

-  soft pitted dates
- / cup salted almond butter
-  tbsp almond milk
- sea salt
- 
directions
* begin by melting / cup of the chocolate  chips with  tbsp of coconut oil in a microwave safe bowl for  seconds. take out, stir a bit, and place back in for another  seconds. stir until fully melted. drop - spoonfuls of chocolate to the bottom of each muffin liner. place the pan in the freezer for set, about  min. while that's setting, add the filling ingredients to a food processor and blend until well combined. amount of blending depends on your texture preference. i liked the little chunks of dates in mine, so i didn't blend for very long. if you're looking for a more uniform texutue, add another tbsp of milk and blend until completely smooth.	emove pan from the freezer and add a spoonful on top of the bottom chocolate layer. my filling was sticky enough to roll into balls, so i did that and then pressed them a bit flat onto the bottom layer. do this for each cup and then place back in the freezer to set again, another  min in the meantime, repeat the chocolate melting process from the beginning with the remaining half of the ingredients. remove pan from freezer, pour chocolate over again, and place back in the freezer to set. took about an hour for me!  these tase best thawed for a min or two out of the freezer. . . .

fluffy maple caramel date cake:

preheat oven to  and grease a brownie pan. place about ish soft dates in a bowl with hot water and let soak for  minutes.

in a separate bowl mix:
- / cup unsweetened apple sauce
-  tbsp olive oil
-  tbsp maple syrup
- / cup @georgiagrinders maple caramel almond butter
- splash of vanilla

stir until smooth. then add the flax egg.

dump the water out of the date bowl and mash the dates with your hands or a fork (i used my hands and it worked fine!) add this mixture to the wet ingredients and stir thoroughly.

in a separate bowl mix:
-  / cups almond flour
- pinch of sea salt, cinnamon, baking powder

pour wet into dry and stir until a smooth batter forms. pour into pan and bake for about - minutes.

vanilla matcha cake 🍵🍰

ingredients

dry:

- . cups gluten free flour blend
- / cup coconut sugar
- pinch of sea salt
- pinch of baking powder

wet:
-  cups canned full fat coconut milk 
- / cup coconut yogurt (plain)
-  tbsp maple syrup

vanilla matcha frosting:

-  cup softened vegan butter (i just let the butter container sit on the stovetop while the cake is cooking to soften)
-  cups powdered sugar
-  tbsp oat milk
- pinch of vanilla
-  tbsp matcha powder

directions

set oven to F and grease two small cake pans. in one bowl, mix the dry ingredients until uniform. in another, mix the wet ingredients until thoroughly combined. add the wet to the dry and combine by folding with a spatula. pour batter into the two pans and bake for - min or until golden brown.

while the cakes are cooking, make the frosting by beating all ingredients with a hand mixer on high. feel free to exclude the matcha powder if you want a plain vanilla icing in the center (i'd say make the frosting and then remove / of it from the bowl and place aside, then add the matcha for the remaining amount). once the cakes are baked and cooled layer the frosting on top of one cake and place the other on top. ice with the remaining frosting. i decorated mine with whipped cream peaks and more matcha powder sprinkled on top.

maple cream cheese drizzle:

-  tbsp room temperature cream cheese (i used vegan)
-  tbsp maple syrup
- / cup powdered sugar
-  tbsp milk of choice (i used dairy free milk)

whisk everything together until a smooth, uniform icing forms. if it's not runny enough, add a splash more of milk. once the muffins have cooled, drizzle them with the icing and let set for a few minutes before enjoying!

i'd honestly save it just for the ganache alone hahaha

chocolate ganache banana snacking cake

-  large ripe bananas, mashd
- / cup melted coconut oil
- / cup maple syrup
-  eggs
-  tsp vanilla extract 
-  cup gluten-free flour blend
- / cup almond flour
-  tsp baking powder
- sea salt
- cinnamon

- chocolate chunks for mixing in  
set the oven to F and grease a brownie tin. in a large bowl, add the wet ingredients and mix until smooth, then stir through the dry ingredients. fold everything together until uniform (careful not to over mix). if using chocolate in the batter, chop up as much as you'd like (i used  cup of dark chocolate chunks) and fold into the batter. transfer to the prepared pan and bake for - min or until golden brown. let cool completely before frosting.

for the frosting i just melted  cup of chocolate chunks with  heaping tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave ( increments of  seconds each, stirring in between). pour over the cooled cake and let set in the fridge before slicing. this cake is best enjoyed heated up for a minute or two in the microwave— all of the chocolate melts and it's so dreamy!

But she likely wasn't brought up to believe there was anything wrong with her body, like women are today. 

Today, the beauty standards are always changing, but the genetic makeup of our bodies can't possibly change as they do. The standard of beauty we see all over our social media feeds are posed, edited, filtered and perfected, they're someone's very best photo, they're the highlight of someone else's life, and when we consume those images every day and compare them to our relaxed, non-filtered, “imperfect” reflections, it's close to impossible for us to feel beautiful. That's why it's so important to remember that the person in that perfected photo on the left, also looks like the REAL photo on the right. We have to create our own standard of beauty, make it as diverse as possible, because one shape, skin colour, hair colour, height or size is not it. 

So, what is beauty to you?

To me, happy is beautiful. 
Healthy is beautiful. 
Real is beautiful.
YOU are beautiful.
